One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated Gon the ground to investigate gravity e ects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to G. However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and G. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated Gconditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and Gsimultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1 G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under Gconditions. Keywords: lymphoblast; microgravity; space radiation; chromosome aberration 1. Introduction Astronauts on deep-space missions will experience continual microgravity ( G) and uninterrupted doses of ionizing radiation higher than any exposure experienced in the history of human spaceight. It is predicted that, during the 3-year human mission to Mars, astronauts will be simultaneously exposed to altered gravity and chronic radiation, with a cumulative e ective radiation dose of about 1 sievert (Sv)  1. The types of radiation were found in the space environment, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The space radiation is more damaging to cells  2. The biological impact of simulated space radiation on mammalian cells and rodents has been extensively investigated in ground-based experiments. Such studies have shown that space radiation not only has higher cancer risk  3,4, but also negatively a ects the function of the cardiovascular  5,6, central nervous  7,8 Life2020 ,10, 187 ; doi:10.3390 life10090187 www.mdpi.com journal lifeLife2020 ,10, 187 2 of 14 and immune 911 systems. The e ects of Gon mammalian cells have been studied extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), or by using clinostats for ground-based experiments. It is well known that Ga ects various cellular functions such as altered cell adherence, protein expression, gene expression, morphology, increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation rates 1215. In space biology studies, there is a basic question; what is the e ect of exposing cells simultaneously toGand spac e radiation? The answer to this question has significant implications on the astronauts health risk assessment and management during long-term space missions. There are many investigations about the combined e ects of space radiation and G, carried out both in space and on the ground (see the review by Moreno-Villanueva et al.)  16. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus. Some reported synergy (i.e., increased detrimental e ects), but some did not. Performing experiments in space is challenging since there is a limited number of opportunities (if any) to repeat the same experiment under the same condition. The sequential treatments, such as cells being irradiated and then exposed to simulated G, have been used in some ground-based experiments. In these experiments, cells are not exposed to radiation and Gat the same time. There are only a few cases in which cells were irradiated while being under the simulated Gcondition. However, for the experiments of this type, it was often necessary to stop clinostat rotation in order to irradiate cells. Recently, we have developed a ground-based system for irradiating cells while they are under simulated Gusing a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat  17,18 as a new system for ground-based space environment studies. This system allows the irradiating of cells without stopping the rotation of the clinostat, hence it is truly simultaneous exposure. As the clinostat rotates, the platform on which cell culture chambers are mounted becomes perpendicular to the direction of the irradiation beam every minute. Cells are irradiated for 0.2 s with either X-ray or carbon ion (C-ion) beam. For X-ray irradiation, a high-speed shutter located in front of the beam port opens for 0.2 s. For C-ion bean irradiation, a respiratory gating system for heavy ion treatment is used. Using these experimental set-ups, we have earlier studied the combined e ects of radiation and G on human broblasts, which are adherent cells. We found that the expression of cell cycle-suppressing genes decreased, and that of cell cycle-promoting genes increased after C-ion irradiation under G compared with irradiation  19. The cell cycle may pass through the checkpoints with DNA damage due to the combined e ects of C-ion and G, suggesting that increased genomic instability might occur in space 19. Indeed, we also found an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cells exposed to both radiation and G, compared to those treated by radiation only 20. In this work, we studied the combined e ects of simulated Gand irradiation on human lymphoblastic TK6 cells, which were originally isolated from spontaneous immortalized lymphoblastic WIL2 cells  21. TK6 cells are relatively stable and express the wild-type tumor suppressor p53gene  22. Unlike broblasts that are adherent cells, TK6 cells grow in suspension. TK6 cells are commonly used in radiation studies to investigate genomic instability  2325 and known to be highly radiosensitive due to e cient radiation-induced apoptosis  26. The endpoints measured in this study were cell survival and CA. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture Cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Since the experiment was performed outside the CO 2incubator, cells were cultured in CO 2-independent medium (COI) (Thermo Fischer Scientic, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10 ( ) fetal bovine serum (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA), 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fischer Scientic) and 1 ( ) penicillinstreptomycin mixed solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and kept at 37C. We also used RPMI medium (Thermo Fischer Scientic) containing 10 ( ) fetal bovine serum (MP Biomedicals), 1 ( ) penicillinstreptomycin mixed solution (Nacalai Tesque) and 10 mM-HEPES (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) at 37C in a CO 2incubator for checking cellar growth. We used disposable, sealed irradiationLife2020 ,10, 187 3 of 14 cell culture chambers (DCC) (Chiyoda Co., Kanagawa, Japan)  27,28. Exponentially growing cells were seeded into DCC. 2.2.

Ltd. (AES), Ibaraki, Japan) has been previously described  20. Cells were irradiated under the simulated Gcondition without stopping the clinostat motion. We used an X-ray generator (200 kV , 14.6 mA, aluminum lter (0.3 mm thick), MultiRad225: Faxitron Bioptics, LLC, Tucson, AZ, USA), and a high-speed shutter (Accelerator Engineering Co., Chiba, Japan) placed in front of the X-ray irradiation port for synchronized X-ray irradiation. For synchronized C-ion irradiation, a synchrotron (Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center, Gunma, Japan) and respiratory gating systems were used. The dose-averaged linear energy transfer is 50 keV m at the center of the 6 cm spread-out Bragg peak of the beam, with an energy of 290 MeV n 29. Cells were irradiated by a 0.2 s pulse of beam when the cell chamber on the clinostat stage becomes perpendicular to the direction of irradiation beam, which took place once every minute. The X:Y ratios of clinorotation were set at 11:13 rpm and 66s:78s, to accurately synchronize irradiation when the samples were in a horizontal position. For the control, cells in the chamber were mounted on a stationary clinostat to achieve static condition (1 G), with the same pulse irradiation  17,18,29,30. The dose rate was approximately 0.03 Gy min for both X-ray and C-ion irradiation under the simulated Gor 1Gconditions. Peltier modules were loaded on the 3D clinostat and the static stage, to maintain constant temperature at 37C 17. Figure 1 shows the details of experimental ow. Frozen TK6 cells were revived and cultured for 4 days prior to seeding into DCCs at the concentration of 8 104cellsmL. The chamber was set on the 3D clinostat. Cells were on the clinostat (or the stationary clinostat) for 24 h prior to irradiation. The cells were then irradiated with X-ray or C-ion under Gcondition without stopping clinostat rotation. For survival fraction analysis, cells were harvested immediately after irradiation, in order to observe the e ect of radiation in the cells exposure under Gor 1Gconditions. Regarding CA, cells were kept under Gor 1Gconditions for 24 h after irradiation, to observe the unrepaired DNA damages.

Cell Survival Fraction Analysis After irradiation, TK6 cells were collected from DCCs and seeded into 96-well plates at various densities depending on the dose and type of radiation, which a ected cell survival di erently.Life2020 ,10, 187 4 of 14 For X-ray irradiation cells, seeding density was 1.6 cells mL. For C-ion irradiation, cells were seeded with 1.6 cells mLfor 0.25 Gy, 16 cells mL for 1.0 Gy, and densities were variable for 0.5 Gy and 0.75 Gy . The plates were incubated for 1014 days at 37C. The wells with the culture medium color change from red to yellow were dened as having colonies, while those with no-color change were dened as no colony formation. We calculated plating e ciency (PE) and survival fraction using the following formula. PE(ln (EW TW)) N (1) where EW is the number of wells with colonies, TW is total number of wells, and N is the average number of cells initially plated per well. Survival fraction () (PE of treatment group) (PE of control group) 100 (2) where the treatment group is exposed to radiation and Gsimultaneously, the control group is exposed to radiation only. Three 96 well-plates were made for each irradiation scheme (X-ray stationary, X-ray clinostat, C-ion stationary, C-ion clinostat), 288 well for each scheme were analyzed. 2.4. Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) We used the PCC technique to collect G2 M-phase chromosomes as previously described  3133. After irradiation, TK6 cells were kept for 24 h under static or Gconditions, to allow them to repair damaged DNA. Then, the cells were split into T75 ask at low density and subcultured at 37C. After incubation for 22 h, we added KaryoMAXColcemidsolution (Thermo Fisher Scientic) to the nal concentration of 90 ng mL in the culture medium, to arrest the cells in mitosis, and incubated them for an additional 7 h before harvesting. Approximately 30 min before harvesting, 50 nM of Calyculin A (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) was added to the culture, so that chromosomes in the G2 phase in the cell cycle would be condensed. 2.5. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) CA was analyzed as previously described  20,34. Chromosomes were spread on slides and hybridized in situ with a combination of three uorescence whole-chromosome human DNA probes for chromosomes 1 (red), 2 (green) and 4 (yellow) (Aquarius, Cytocell, Oxford Gene Technology, Oxfordshire, UK), according to the recommended protocol by the manufacturer. Then, we used DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain all chromosomes. The c omplex exchange was defined as two or more chromosomes containing three or more breaks  32. The simple exchange was defined as an exchange of arms between two chromosomes, resulting in dicentrics and translocations. Incomplete translocations and incomplete dicentrics were classified as simple exchanges, assuming that, in most cases, the reciprocal fragments are below the level of detection. Each type of exchange (dicentrics, apparently simple reciprocal exchanges, incompletes, or complex) was counted as one exchange, and values for total exchanges were derived by adding the yields. When two or more painted chromosomes were damaged, each was scored separately. At least 1000 cells were scored or headed up to 50 aberrations for each data point in the sample of each irradiation dose. 2.6. Statistical Analysis We calculated the ratio between aberrations scored and total cells analyzed for the frequencies of CA as reported previously  20. Several studies have indicated that the distribution of radiation damages among chromosomes is random, and the yield of exchanges measured within the rst division after exposure is proportional to the DNA content of the chromosome analyzed, with someLife2020 ,10, 187 5 of 14 uctuation of data  35. We extrapolated the frequencies of exchanges in individual chromosomes to whole-genome equivalents using the following formula reported by Lucas et al. 36. Fp2.05fp(1 fp)fp1fp2 fp1fp3 fp2fp3FG (3) where Fp is the combined frequency of exchanges in all painted chromosomes; fp is the fraction of the whole genome comprised of the painted chromosomes; fp1, fp2 and fp3 are the fractions of the genome for chromosomes 1, 2 and 4, respectively; and FG is the whole-genome aberration frequency. From this formula, the genomic frequency for TK6 cells was calculated to be 2.48 times that detected on chromosomes 1, 2 and 4. Standard errors for aberration frequencies were calculated assuming Poisson statistics. Error bars in the gure represent the standard error of the mean values. The Fishers exact test was used to assess whether the di erence in frequency of chromosome exchanges is signicant between di erent treatment groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the e ect of radiation dose and gravity on total exchanges, using total exchange as dependent variable and radiation dose and gravity as independent variables. 3. Results 3.1. Cell Survival Figure 2a shows the growth of TK6 cells cultured in regular RPMI medium in a CO 2incubator and COI medium. Compared to the RPMI medium, cell growth was slower in the COI medium. Under the culturing condition using the COI medium, the doubling time was 24 h. Figure 2b shows the survival fraction irradiated by X-ray and 290 MeV n C-ion under the static condition. Since cells were irradiated by 0.2-s pulses under simulated Gand at 1 Gstatic condition, the survival study was conducted using the 0.2-s pulse exposure, as well as continuous exposure. After maintaining Gor 1Gcondition for 24 h and irradiation, the unirradiated cell numbers of 1 Gcondition were 1.28 1050.222 cells mL, while the unirradiated cell numbers under Gcondition were 1.17 1050.354 cells mL. For each dose level, the cumulative dose of pulse irradiation was the same as that of continuous exposure. There was no signicant di erence in the survival fraction between Gand 1 G. Compared to the survival curve for cells irradiated by X-ray which showed a shoulder, the exponential survival curve for C-ion had no such shoulder. C-ion was more lethal than X-ray per unit dose.

We also found that 0.25 Gy C-ion beam exposure and 0.5 Gy X-ray exposure had similar cell survival fraction. Based on these results, we selected the cumulative doses of 0.5 Gy, 1.1 Gy and 1.5 Gy for X-ray, 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy for C-ion, to assess the combined e ect of simulated Gand radiation on CA in TK6 cells. 3.2.

Figure 4 shows the relationship between irradiation doses and total exchanges. For each source of radiation, the frequency of CA increased with dose. The frequency of CA increased in cells exposed under the G condition compared to those exposed un der the static condition. At the same irradiation dose, CA was more frequently observed in C-ion irradiated cells than in X-ray irradiated counter parts. Furthermore, at the iso-survival fr action dose, C-ion irradiation produced more CA than X-ray irradiation. Figure 4.

Discussion Humans will face the unique environment in space, represented by both G and the space radiation, which contains a wide variety of ion species with various ranges of energy. It is challenging to simulate these space environments in ones laboratory. Although many studies have reported the increased sensitivity of cells to radiation and decreased levels of DNA repair under simulated G, most of these studies were performed using X-ray or -ray 16. In the future Mars missions, GCR exposure, made up of high-energ y and charged nuclei, will be of more serious concern than low linear energy transfer (LET) ex posure. For this reason, it is important to investigate the effects of both low- and high-LET exposure under the G. In our previous studies, Figure 5.

Discussion Humans will face the unique environment in space, represented by both Gand the space radiation, which contains a wide variety of ion species with various ranges of energy. It is challenging to simulate these space environments in ones laboratory. Although many studies have reported the increased sensitivity of cells to radiation and decreased levels of DNA repair under simulated G, most of these studies were performed using X-ray or -ray  16. In the future Mars missions, GCR exposure, made up of high-energy and charged nuclei, will be of more serious concern than low linear energy transfer (LET) exposure. For this reason, it is important to investigate the e ects of both low- and high-LET exposure under the G. In our previous studies, we have shown changes in cell cycle-related genes expression  19 and increased frequency of CA  20 in human broblasts using our unique SSS 17,18. CA data obtained from chromosome 1, 2 and 4 were extrapolated to the whole genome using a modied version of the equation of Lucas et al.  36. Originally, Lucas reported the formula to calculate whole- genome exchange frequency based on low-LET radiation exposure. Although damages caused by high-LET exposure were expected to di erent form damages induced by low-LET exposure, we applied this modied formula in many cases of single-mono energetic ion beams in various LET, as well as mixed beam  33,37,38, and the results were in good agreement with the CA frequenciesLife2020 ,10, 187 9 of 14 simulated by Monte Carlo modeling both single beam and mixed beams  3941. This formula is applicable to high-LET exposure in the range of doses we used in this study. CA has been shown to increase in the lymphocytes of astronauts after long missions lasting for several months in space  4244. CA is positively correlated with increased incidents of cancer  4345. Therefore, CA is a gold standard in the biodosimetry for radiation, and has been used for the risk assessment of space radiation. To follow up our previous study with adherent 1BR-hTERT cells  20, we used non-adherent TK6 cells to investigate whether the similar combined e ect of radiation and G on CA frequency is observed. Compared to the cells exposed to radiation only, higher frequencies of CA were found in TK6 cells under the condition of simultaneous exposure to radiation and G (Figure 4). Our study indicates that this combined e ect is independent of radiation types, as both X-ray and C-ion beams were more detrimental under Gthan 1 G. Thus, our study suggests that the e ects of ionizing radiation and Gare more than additive and that astronauts risk of CA increases during long space ights. We observed higher frequencies of CA in TK6 cells with the same dose of irradiation. Under the same survival fraction dose, we detected increased incidence of the complex type of CA in TK6 cells, although the frequency of total CA was similar between TK6 cells and 1BR-hTERT cells. It is not clear if this di erence is due to higher radio sensitivity of TK6 cells than that of 1BR-hTERT or due to the way these cells are cultured: adherent and oating. It is reported that there was wide variation in chromatid break frequencies, but it was only slightly higher than that reported for primary human cells in TK6. The dicentric frequency was more than 10-fold higher for TK6 cells than that reported for normal primary human cells. TK6 cells also show much higher levels of non-reciprocal chromosome translocations than are usually observed in primary human cells  46. The higher frequency of the complexed exchanges in TK6 compare to broblasts in our study supports a previous report. The extent of the combined e ect might depend on the cell types. Further investigation is needed sing di erent cell types. Manti et al. reported no e ects of simulated Gon CA in human lymphocytes irradiated with X-ray or proton beam  47, whereas Mosesso et al. showed increased CA in human lymphocytes irradiated by 1.5 Gy of X-ray  48. Our results on both adherent  20 and oating (current study) cells support the results of Mosesso et al.  48. More importantly, we have observed these e ects, not only with X-ray exposure, but also with relatively low dose of C-ion exposure as well, which is more relevant for the condition in the ISS  4952. These results support the reports of increased genomic damages in human lymphoblasts exposed to ionizing radiation under simulated Gconditions compared to 1G53,54. Based on the cell survival analysis, we irradiated cells with the doses that induce the same survival fraction. Compared to the cell irradiated with X-ray, higher frequencies of CA were observed with C-ion irradiation. It is well known that CA induction by heavy ions indicates a higher frequency of complex exchanged compare to low-LET radiation, and the observed rearrangements are of greater complexity  55. The complex type of CA observed in cells irradiated with C-ion are higher compare to irradiated to X-ray both under Gand 1 Gin this study. Monte Carlo simulations as well as various other experiments indicate that complex DNA lesions with multiple damage sites, including double strand breaks, single strand breaks, and other damages within one or two helical turns referred to as clustered DNA damage are caused by heavy ion irradiation  56,57. DNA breaks by X-ray irradiation are much less clustered, and it is likely to be repaired properly. Since clustered DNA breaks are di cult to correctly repair, breaks made by heavy ion irradiation are more likely to cause CAs. In this study, no signicant di erence was observed in cell survival between Gand 1 G, suggesting that the extent of all cause cell death including apoptosis is the same. Since the frequency of CAs was greatly increased by simultaneous exposure to simulated Gand radiation compared to radiation alone, it is possible that cells were proliferating with unrepaired CA. For the survival fraction analysis in this study, cells were rst acclimatized to the simulated Gor 1Gcondition, then irradiated under the respective gravitational condition, and seeded for culturing at 1 Gimmediately after irradiation (Figure 1).Life2020 ,10, 187 10 of 14 The exact reasons for increased CA under simulated Ghave not been fully elucidated to date. Previous studies suggest that the expression of DNA repair genes was decreased in human lymphoblasts grown under simulated G58, and that CA in human peripheral blood lymphocytes were enhanced by simulated Gthrough inhibition of DNA repair  59. These results appear to establish correlation between decreased expression of DNA repair genes and CA found in cells exposed toG. In our previous study, we found decreased cell cycle-suppressing gene and increased cell cycle-promoting genes on human broblasts grown under Gand C-ion irradiation. It was suggested that cells containing DNA damages induced by the combined stimulation with Gand C-ion may be allowed to rapidly pass through the cell cycle checkpoints without complete DNA repair, and that this may induce increased CA in these cells 19. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Although comparison of simulated Gand 1 Gin each dose did not have enough statistical power to show signicant di erence (only 3 cases sowed p0.05 in Table 1), the multivariate logistical regression analysis provided signicant contributions of Gin frequency of total exchanges (Table 2). Independent of radiation exposure dose, simulated Gcause 1.635 and 1.487 times of total exchanges, in comparison to 1 Gunder X-ray and C-ion radiation exposure, respectively (Table 2). Taken together, our results discussed above indicate that the e ects of Gand radiation are more than additive. We are aware that results from in vitro studies cannot be directly applied to in vivo biological events. The ground-based simulated Gdoes not exactly recapitulate the Gin space. However, there is limited access for spaceight experiments. It is di cult to perform a su cient number of replicated experiments in space to establish statistical signicance. Additionally, experiments on the ISS do not give a deep space radiation environment. Thus, it is important to perform ground-based experiments using various devices that simulate the simultaneous exposure of cells and animals to Gand radiation. We trust that the results from such studies will be useful in assessing various risks of space travel, and eventually coming up with means of mitigation. Further investigations are in progress. Furthermore, we anticipate that our experimental results will corroborate the recent model calculations of radiation risk uncertainties 60. 5. Conclusions Higher incidence of CA in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells was demonstrated when the cells were exposed to radiation (X-ray and C-ion) under simulated Gthan when exposed to the same level of radiation only. Our ndings show that the space radiation risk assessment on human health based on experiments performed at 1 Gmay result in underestimating astronauts potential risk for cancer and other debilitating health conditions due to GCR. We found that C-ion irradiation induced a higher frequency of complex type of CA compared to X-ray irradiation at the same cell survival fraction dose. The occurrence of complex CA was higher in TK6 cells than in human broblasts that we used earlier in similar CA studies. Our results suggest the importance of conducting similar studies using not only di erent cell types and radiation doses and types, but also other end points and model systems under the combined environment of Gand radiation.

        "introduction": "Astronauts on deep-space missions will experience continual microgravity ( G) and uninterrupted doses of ionizing radiation higher than any exposure experienced in the history of human spaceight. It is predicted that, during the 3-year human mission to Mars, astronauts will be simultaneously exposed to altered gravity and chronic radiation, with a cumulative e ective radiation dose of about 1 sievert (Sv)  1. The types of radiation were found in the space environment, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The space radiation is more damaging to cells  2. The biological impact of simulated space radiation on mammalian cells and rodents has been extensively investigated in ground-based experiments. Such studies have shown that space radiation not only has higher cancer risk  3,4, but also negatively a ects the function of the cardiovascular  5,6, central nervous  7,8 Life2020 ,10, 187 ; doi:10.3390 life10090187 www.mdpi.com journal lifeLife2020 ,10, 187 2 of 14 and immune 911 systems. The e ects of Gon mammalian cells have been studied extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), or by using clinostats for ground-based experiments. It is well known that Ga ects various cellular functions such as altered cell adherence, protein expression, gene expression, morphology, increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation rates 1215. In space biology studies, there is a basic question; what is the e ect of exposing cells simultaneously toGand spac e radiation? The answer to this question has significant implications on the astronauts health risk assessment and management during long-term space missions. There are many investigations about the combined e ects of space radiation and G, carried out both in space and on the ground (see the review by Moreno-Villanueva et al.)  16. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus. Some reported synergy (i.e., increased detrimental e ects), but some did not. Performing experiments in space is challenging since there is a limited number of opportunities (if any) to repeat the same experiment under the same condition. The sequential treatments, such as cells being irradiated and then exposed to simulated G, have been used in some ground-based experiments. In these experiments, cells are not exposed to radiation and Gat the same time. There are only a few cases in which cells were irradiated while being under the simulated Gcondition. However, for the experiments of this type, it was often necessary to stop clinostat rotation in order to irradiate cells. Recently, we have developed a ground-based system for irradiating cells while they are under simulated Gusing a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat  17,18 as a new system for ground-based space environment studies. This system allows the irradiating of cells without stopping the rotation of the clinostat, hence it is truly simultaneous exposure. As the clinostat rotates, the platform on which cell culture chambers are mounted becomes perpendicular to the direction of the irradiation beam every minute. Cells are irradiated for 0.2 s with either X-ray or carbon ion (C-ion) beam. For X-ray irradiation, a high-speed shutter located in front of the beam port opens for 0.2 s. For C-ion bean irradiation, a respiratory gating system for heavy ion treatment is used. Using these experimental set-ups, we have earlier studied the combined e ects of radiation and G on human broblasts, which are adherent cells. We found that the expression of cell cycle-suppressing genes decreased, and that of cell cycle-promoting genes increased after C-ion irradiation under G compared with irradiation  19. The cell cycle may pass through the checkpoints with DNA damage due to the combined e ects of C-ion and G, suggesting that increased genomic instability might occur in space 19. Indeed, we also found an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cells exposed to both radiation and G, compared to those treated by radiation only 20. In this work, we studied the combined e ects of simulated Gand irradiation on human lymphoblastic TK6 cells, which were originally isolated from spontaneous immortalized lymphoblastic WIL2 cells  21. TK6 cells are relatively stable and express the wild-type tumor suppressor p53gene  22. Unlike broblasts that are adherent cells, TK6 cells grow in suspension. TK6 cells are commonly used in radiation studies to investigate genomic instability  2325 and known to be highly radiosensitive due to e cient radiation-induced apoptosis  26. The endpoints measured in this study were cell survival and CA. 2. Materials and",
        "conclusion": "s Higher incidence of CA in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells was demonstrated when the cells were exposed to radiation (X-ray and C-ion) under simulated Gthan when exposed to the same level of radiation only. Our ndings show that the space radiation risk assessment on human health based on experiments performed at 1 Gmay result in underestimating astronauts potential risk for cancer and other debilitating health conditions due to GCR. We found that C-ion irradiation induced a higher frequency of complex type of CA compared to X-ray irradiation at the same cell survival fraction dose. The occurrence of complex CA was higher in TK6 cells than in human broblasts that we used earlier in similar CA studies. Our results suggest the importance of conducting similar studies using not only di erent cell types and radiation doses and types, but also other end points and model systems under the combined environment of Gand radiation.
