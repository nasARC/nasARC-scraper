Introduction The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding mer - istemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella ini - tials), which form a stem cell niche (SCN) ( Supplementary Figure S1 available at JXB online; Bennett and Scheres, This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:creativecommons.orglicensesby3.0), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Each initial cell gives rise to the different root tissues, being the outermost lateral root cap, epidermis, ground tissue (cortex and endodermis), pericycle, and the innermost vascu - lar tissues to make up a radial arrangement of root tissues. Along the longitudinal axis, the root is composed of a distal structure lateral root cap and columella layers derived from the columella stem cell initials (CSCs), the SCN, proximal meristem, transition zone, elongation zone, and differentia - tion zone ( Perilli and Sabatini, 2010 ; Lee et al. , 2013 ). This cylinder-like concentric root structure is established by a balance between cell division in initials, stem cells, and mer - istematic cells of the proximaldistal meristems, and differen- tiation of these cells into diverse cell types in the elongation differentiation zone. This balance is under the tight control of unknown QC-directed signals and environmental cues that regulate the spatiotemporal expression of master regulatory genes for cell fate determination ( Scheres, 2007 ; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011 ). In general, when asymmetric division of a stem cell initial occurs, the daughter cell that has contact with the QC remains as an initial cell whereas the other daughter cellwhich is separate from the QCdivides to form transit- amplifying cells at the boundary of the proximal meristem (Scheres, 2007 ; Perilli et al. , 2012 ). Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed in Bennett and Scheres, 2010 ; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011 ; Lee et al. , 2013 ). Among them, auxin is a major cell fate-instructive hormone that is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and CSCs at the root tip to form an auxin maximum (Friml et al. , 2003 ; Blilou et al. , 2005 ). The auxin maximum specifies the hypophysis and the QC and regulates formation of the root meristem ( Sabatini et al. , 1999 ). The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of auxin carrier proteins including the pin-formed (PINs) ( Grieneisen et al. , 2007 ). Antagonistic regulation of PIN phosphoryla - tiondephosphorylation by the pinoid (PID) protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively, directs topological patterning of PINs and the subsequent auxin flux (Michniewicz et al. , 2007 ). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are polyhydroxylated steroid hor - mones that play pivotal roles in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes ( Zhu et al. , 2013 ). Upon bind - ing of a BR to its receptor, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) forms a heterodimeric complex with bri1-associated receptor kinase1somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase3 (BAK1SERK3)( Bcherl et al. , 2013 ), and the fully activated BRI1BAK1 complex then initiates a signalling cascade that activates the positively acting transcription factors brassina - zole resistant 1BRI1 EMS suppressor 2 (BZR1BES2) and BZR2BES1 to regulate expression of a wide range of genes and the subsequent plant growth and development ( He et al. , 2005 ; Sun et al. , 2010 ; Yu et al. , 2011 ). BR-induced nuclear localization of BZR1BES1 is crucial for BR activities ( Wang et al. , 2002 ; Yin et al. , 2002 ), and this localization is depend - ent on the phosphorylation and 14-3-3 modification status of the BZR1BES1 proteins ( Gampala et al. , 2007 ; Ryu et al. , 2007 ; Ryu et al. , 2010 ). Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) is a GSK3Shaggy-like kinase that phosphorylates BZR1 BES1, thus acting as a negative regulator of the BR signal transduction pathway ( Li and Nam, 2002 ; Yan et al. , 2009 ). In contrast, PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 and abolishes BZR1 binding to the 14-3-3- proteins to activate BR-responsive gene expression and plant growth ( Tang et al. , 2011 ). BRs regulate root growth in a concentration-dependent manner: they promote root growth at low concentrations and inhibit it at high concentrations ( Mssig et al. , 2003 ; Kim et al. , 2007 ). They also play a regulatory role in the control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in the Arabidopsis root meristem: plants treated with BR or mutants with enhanced BR signalling, such as bes1-D , show prema - ture cell cycle exit that results in early differentiation of mer - istematic cells ( Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ). In addition, BRs promote QC division and differentiation of distal stem cells. In fact, the BRI1-like 3 (BRL3) signalosome complex containing BAK1 and BRL1 modulates root growth and development by contributing to the cellular activities of pro - vascular and QC cells ( Fbregas et al. , 2013 ). Recently two BR transcriptional targets brassinosteroids at vascular and organizing centre (BRA VO) and ethylene response fac - tor 115 (ERF115)regulating QC quiescence in opposite ways have been identified ( Heyman et al. , 2013 ; Vilarrasa- Blasi et al. , 2014 ). BRA VO acts as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions, and BR-regulated BES1 counteracts its action by directly repressing and physically interacting with the BRA VO ( Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. , 2014 ). ERF115 induces QC cell division by acting through phytosulfokines 5 (PSK5) signalling, and BR drives QC proliferation by stimulating ERF115 expression ( Heyman et al. , 2013 ). Here it is revealed that BR-induced accumulation of BZR1 in the root tips and down-regulationre-localization of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 proteins may result in changes in auxin distri - bution and the resulting auxin maximum area. This alteration in the auxin localization domain together with gene expres - sion regulation of BRAVO , ERF115 , and other root-regulat - ing genes may lead to ectopic activation of QC division and suppression of CSC differentiation. It is also demonstrated that BR and the related BZR1-BES1-mediated signalling pathways have opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Arabidopsis roots in a BR concentration-dependent and a signalling molecule-dependent manner. Materials and methods Plant materials and growth conditions Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0, Col-0), its ethylene biosynthesis mutant eto1-11 and BR-related mutants ( det2, bri1-116 , bzr1-D , and bri1-116 bzr1-D ), and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Enkheim-2, En-2) and its mutant bes1-D plants were used for QC, CSC, and columella cell (CC) phenotype analysis and root-regulat - ing gene expression analysis. pBZR1::BZR1-YFP and p35S::BES1- GFP plants were used for BZR1 subcellular localization study and ChIP-qPCR assays. Promoter-driven reporter seeds were kindly provided by Dr Wang at Carnegie Institution for Science, USA (pBZR1::BZR1-YFP , pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP , and 35S::BES1-GFP ); BZR1-mediated QC division and suppression of columella stem cell differentiation  4837 Dr Laux at the University of Freiburg, Germany ( pWOX5::GFP ); Dr Benfey at Duke University, USA ( pSCR::SCR-GFP ); Dr Guilfoyle at University of Missouri, Columbia, USA ( DR5::GFP and DR5::GUS ); Dr Friml at Ghent University, Belgium ( pPIN3::PIN3- GFP , pPIN4::PIN4-GFP , and pPIN7::PIN7-GFP ); and Dr Scheres at Ultrecht University, The Netherlands ( pCo2::YFP H2B, and J2341 ). The following plants were generated: bzr1-D x pWOX5::GFP , bzr1- D x pSCR::SCR-GFP , bzr1-D x pC O2::YFP H2B, DR5::GFP x bzr1- D, and DR5::GFP x mx3 (pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP ). These reporter seedlings were used to trace expression and behaviour of the fusion proteins under the confocal laser-scanning microscope. Seeds were surface-sterilized by sequential washing with 70 EtOH0.1 Triton X-100 for 20 min, 70 EtOH for 10 min, and 95 EtOH for 10 min. Seeds were dried on a clean bench and cold- treated in the dark at 4 C for 72 h. These sterilized seeds were then sown on 12 MS agar medium containing 0.8 phytoagar (pH 5.7) in the presence or absence of the indicated chemicals. Plants were grown in a growth chamber operating under a cycle of 16 h light and 8 h dark at 2325 C with 70 humidity. All seedlings were grown vertically. Chemicals Brassinolide (BL) and X-GLUC were purchased from Duchefa (The Netherlands) and MB Cell (USA), respectively. All other chemi - cals used in this report were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) unless otherwise indicated. Brassinazole (BRZ), bikinin (BK), and -(phenyl ethyl-2-one)-IAA (PEO-IAA) were kindly provided by Dr Y oshida (RIKEN, Japan), Dr Beeckman (Ghent University, Belgium), and Dr Hayashi (Okayama University of Science, Japan), respectively. Histochemical staining For propidium iodide (PI) staining (reported in Figs 1 and 5), roots were incubated for 30 min in PI (5 gml), rinsed, and mounted in H2O before confocal microscopic observation. Staining and detection of -glucuronidase (GUS) activity was performed according to the method of Jefferson (1987) , with some modifications. In brief, roots were fixed in 90 acetone for 20 min and infiltrated with staining buffer 0.1 M phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM K 4Fe(CN) 63H 20, and 1 mgml X- GLUC. The resulting stained root tissues were then fixed and processed as described in mPS-PI staining method. mPS-PI staining was performed according to the method of Truernit et al. (2008) with some modifications to reveal cell shape, the presence of starch granules, and auxin maximum (described in Figs 2 , 3 and 4). In brief, roots were fixed in fixative (50 metha - nol and 10 acetic acid) and then incubated in 1 periodic acid after rinsing with water. Next, the tissues were treated with modified Pseudo Schiff reagent (100 mM sodium metabisulphite and 0.15N HCl, supplemented with freshly added PI to a final concentration of 100 gml). The samples were transferred onto microscope slides and covered with a chloral hydrate solution (4 g chloral hydrate, 1 ml glycerol, and 2 ml water) for 5 min to observe fluorescence or reflec - tion signals using the Zeiss Confocal microscope. Confocal microscopy PI, YFPGFP, and GUS signals were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an argon 2 ion laser (488 nm) and a HeNe 1 ion laser (543 nm). For observa - tion of PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 543 nm to collect the PI signal at 595615 nm or excited at 488 nm to detect GFP sig - nal at 493545 nm or YFP signal at 521560 nm. For observation of mPS-PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 488 nm and the emis - sion was collected at 520720 nm to detect the PI signal. The stained signal for GUS activity was obtained using the reflection mode of the confocal microscope. In this case, the excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and the reflection signal was collected at 485491 nm. Images were compiled and analysed using the LSM 710 ZEN image browser software. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from root tissues using the Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea) and treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega, USA) according to the manufactur - ers instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was per - formed by the SYBR green method using the Applied Biosystems Step One Plus System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The expression of each transcript was normalized against the amount of UBC1 control in each sample. CPD was used as a control for BR-repressed genes. The results were reported as expression relative to the Col-0 mock control ( Figs 1G , 1H, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B) or Col-0 or En-2 genetic control ( Figs 1I , 5C, and 6C). Three to five biological rep - licates were included in each experiment, and the data were sta - tistically analysed using the Students t-test. Primers used for the qRT-PCRs are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 (available at JXB online). ChIP-qPCR assay ChIP experiments were performed as previously described with minor modifications ( Gendrel et al. , 2005 ) using the non-transgenic Columbia-0, plants expressing native promoter-driven BZR1-GFP (pBZR1::BZR1-YFP ), and plants constitutively expressing BES1- GFP ( p35S::BES1-GFP ). In brief, week-old seedlings were cross- linked with 1 formaldehyde and the chromatin DNA fragments (500 bp in length) were isolated from their nuclei of root tissues to retrieve BZR1 or BES1-binding DNA fragments using rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam, UK). The bound DNA fragments were then extracted using the GelPCR DNA frag - ments extraction kit (RBC Bioscience, Korea) and the amount of the bound DNA was measured by performing real-time PCRs with the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S2 (available at JXB online) using equal amounts of DNA from the input and the CoIP fractions. Results Both BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways stimulate mitotic reactivation of QC cells The QC is the source of stem cell initials and is maintained at the G1S cell cycle checkpoint and thus divides infrequently (Jiang and Feldman, 2005 ). BR-induced nuclear localization of BES1, a positive regulator of the BR signalling pathways, in the QC promotes QC reactivation, leading to produc - tion of two layers of QC cells ( Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ; Heyman et al. , 2013 ; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. , 2014 ) and results in CSC differentiation ( Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ). In this report, whether BZR1, a BES1 homologue, is also actively involved in BR-regulated QC regulation was tested. BZR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of epidermal cells and some cortex cells of the proximal root tips of pBZR1:BZR1- YFP plants when they are grown in medium lacking BL (a type of BR) ( Fig. 1A ). It was found that, contrary to a previ - ous report ( Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. , 2014 ), supplying BL in the medium enhanced nuclear localization of BZR1 in the cells of the SCN area, so that concentrated nuclear expression was found in the root tip cells including the QC, cells above the QC, the CSC, and CCs ( Fig. 1A ). Similar localization of 4838  Lee et al. BZR1 was evident within 15 min when BL was applied to 7-d- old seedlings (data not shown). This implies that not only the reported BES1- but also the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway may actively be involved in QC division and the dis - tal CSC differentiation. To assess roles of the BZR1-mediated signalling pathway in these developmental processes, whether the BR and BZR1- mediated signalling pathway modulates the mitotically inac - tive status of the QC was investigated. Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 1010 M BL showed an increased frequency of mitotically activated QC cells, such that 58 of plants had two layers of QC cells with periclinal divi - sion by 7 d after germination (DAG) as determined by mor - phologic lineage ( Fig. 1B ). In comparison, 5 of untreated Col-0 plants harboured double layers of QC cells. Consistent with a previous report ( Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ), more than 80 of plants with the bes1-D BR-signalling enhanc - ing mutation in an En-2 background showed reactivated QC Fig. 1.

For evaluation of BLs long-term effects, Col-0 plants were grown on 12 MS agar media for 7 DAG in the presence or absence of BL (H). To analyse expression of QC-related genes in diverse BR mutant plants, Col-0 or En-2 and their mutant plants were grown on 12 MS agar media for 8 DAG (I).

It was next examined whether BZR1-mediated BR signalling results in similar QC reactivation. It was found that the QC was also frequently reactivated in BR-signalling enhanced bzr1-D plants, such that two QC layers were observed in 50 of the plants by 7 DAG and in 75 of the plants by 14 DAG (Fig. 1B , C; Supplementary Table S3 ). This QC reactivation was less frequent than that in bes1-D plants, but was greatly enhanced compared with Col-0 and BR-signalling defective bri1-116 plants, which hardly ever showed QC division at 7 DAG. Introduction of bzr1-D clearly reactivated the QC of bri1-116 (divided QCs were present in 37 of the bri1- 116bzr1-D plants by 7 DAG and 69 by 14 DAG), which implies that BRI1BZR1-mediated BR signalling is actively involved in reactivation of QC division.

WOX5 expression in the embryonic cell lineage leads to QC formation and is involved in maintaining the stem cell state in a non-autonomous manner ( Haeker et al. , 2004 ; Sarkar et al. , 2007 ). It was demonstrated that the QC marker WOX5 was expressed in both divided QC cells while a cortex marker (pC O2::YFP H2B, Heidstra et al. , 2004 ), was unchanged in its expression pattern when these plants were grown on medium containing BL ( Fig. 1D ). SCARECROW (SCR) is required for specification of QC identity, stem cell homeostasis and asymmetric cell division ( Sabatini et al. , 2003 ; Moubayidin et al. , 2013 ). In this study, the SCR reporter plants grown on medium containing BL reactivated QC cell division as deter - mined by morphologic cell lineage but, unexpectedly, SCR protein accumulated predominantly in the upper QC in most BL-treated cells. To verify the effect of BR on QC division, bzr1-D was crossed with different cell-specific marker lines (Fig. 1D ). For bzr1-D pWOX5::GFP , 50 of the plants showed GFP expression in both the upper and lower cells of the QC whereas the other 50 showed expression only in the upper cell. In most bzr1-D pSCR::GFP , the GFP signal was present only in the upper cell of the QC. This lack of WOX5 and SCR expression in the rootward QC cells may indicate an asymmetric QC division and loss of functional QC identity. Ethylene overexpressor 1 (ETO1) and CULLIN3 (CUL3) are a part of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that modulates the level of 1-Aminocyclopropane-1 carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase 5 (ACS5) catalysing the rate-limiting step of ethyl - ene biosynthesis. It was previously reported that the gain-of- function eto1-11 mutant overproduces ethylene and promotes QC cell division ( Ortega-Martinez et al. , 2007 ). In this regard, it was tested whether the BZR1-mediated BR signalling path - way interacts with ETO1-promoted ethylene pathway in the regulation of the QC cell division. bzr1-D plants grown for 8 DAG showed QC cell division at a frequency of 74 ( Fig. 1E ). Treatment of neither an ethylene action inhibitor AgNO 3 nor biosynthetic inhibitors, aminoethoxy-vinylglycine (A VG) and CoCl 2, interfered with this bzr1-D -induced QC cell division. Similarly, treatment of eto1-11 mutants with BRZ, a BR bio - synthesis inhibitor ( Asami et al. , 2000 ), did not significantly influence the QC reactivation frequency of eto1-11 plants (Fig. 1F ). Moreover, both eto1-11 genetic background pro - voking QC cell division at a frequency of 61 and treatment of BL inducing cell division at a frequency of 45 additively coordinated the promotion of QC cell reactivation, thus BL-treated eto1-11 plants showed two-layered reactivated QC cells at a frequency of 97. These results indicate that BZR1-mediated BR signalling and ETO1-promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting BZR1-mediated QC reactivation, expression of WOX5 , SCR , and SHR genes was significantly increased by both short-term (3 h, Fig. 1G ) and long-term (7 DAG, Fig. 1H ) treatments of BL. Consistent with BR-induced up- regulation, their expression was significantly repressed in BR signalling-defective bri1-116 plants, but greatly increased in signalling-enhanced bzr1-D plants and bri1-116 bzr1-D double mutants ( Fig. 1I ). In addition, BL treatment greatly suppressed gene expression of BRAVO (a negative regulator of QC divisions; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. , 2014 ) and increased the expression of ERF115 (a positive regulator of QC division; Heyman et al. , 2013 ) in both the short-term and long-term treated Col-0 plants ( Fig. 1G , H). Again, their expression was tightly controlled in a BRI1BZR1-mediated signalling- dependent manner ( Fig. 1I ). Expression of BRAVO and ERF115 was similarly regulated in bes1-D plants to those of bzr1-D plants. Expression of genes regulating ethylene bio - synthesis was also examined, and it was found that expression of CUL3 , ACS5 , and ETO1 was not regulated by BR treat - ment nor was it different in bzr1-D or bes1-D plants com - pared with the Col-0 or En-2 plants, respectively ( Fig 1G I). These results support the conclusion that BRs promote QC cell division independently from the ethylene pathway. BRs apparently exert opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in a concentration- and BZR1-BES1-dependent manner Results presented thus far have shown that the BRI1BZR1- mediated BR signalling pathway was able to reactivate and produce multiple layers of the QC ( Fig. 1B ; Supplementary Table S3 available at JXB online). In addition, BL treatment greatly enhanced expression of a columella initial marker, J2341 , and expanded its expression to the QC, CC, and other root tip cells ( Fig. 1D ). These observations, together with BL-induced intense nuclear localization of BZR1 in the QC, CSCs, and CCs ( Fig. 1A ), prompted an investigation of the effects of BR on the maintenance and differentiation of distal CSCs by examining the development of starch-accumulated columella cells. First, the cell layer number of QC, CSC, and CC was meas - ured for Col-0 ( Fig. 2A ) and BR biosynthesis-defective de- etiolated2 (det2; Noguchi et al. , 1999 ) (Fig. 2B ) plants grown on media containing various concentrations of BL, ranging from 1015 to 109 M. To do this, root tips were stained with PI by performing mPS-PI staining to mark cell walls and starch granules. As expected, BL stimulated division of the QC in a concentration-dependent manner in both Col-0 and det2 plants. Less than 10 of Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried two layers of QC, and the proportion of plants with the divided QC was greatly increased after exogenous treatment with BL: 60 and 82 of Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 1010 M and 109 M, respec - tively, contained two layers of QC ( Fig. 2A , D). In contrast, differentiation of CSC into CC was inhibited by the BL treat - ment. Most Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried a single layer of CSCs, and only 15 of plants had two layers of CSCs. The proportion of Col plants with two CSC layers was moderately increased (2530) by the 1015 M to 1011 M of BL treatment, and it reached to 52 by the 1010 M BL treatment, which implies that BL inhibits CSC differentiation into CC. Consistent with this, treatment of exogenous BL reduced the number of CC layers. For example, Col plants grown without exogenous BL had 57 seedlings with four layers of CCs and 43 with three layers of CCs ( Fig. 2A ). Interestingly, the proportion of plants with fewer CC layers BZR1-mediated QC division and suppression of columella stem cell differentiation  4841 steadily increased with increasing amount of BL treatment, so that plants grown on medium containing 1010 M BL showed 25 seedlings with four layers of CCs, 68 with three layers of CCs, and 7 with two layers of CCs. These concentration- dependent developmental trends of QC, CSC, and CC layers were clearly reproduced in BL-treated det2 plants ( Fig. 2B ). Surprisingly, treatment of Col-0 plants with a higher con - centration of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development: it promoted CSC differentiation and the resulting CC development. Seventeen percent of Col-0 plants grown on 109 M BL had two lay - ers of CSCs, which is far below the frequency compared with those of the plants grown on 1015 M to 1011 M of BL, and is about the same frequency as with mock-treated plants. Moreover, plants with no CSC (whose starch granules of cells resided underneath the QC were stained with PI) were present at a frequency of 18, which was hardly observed in the mock- and lower BL-treated Col-0 plants ( Fig. 2A , D). Consistent with this observation, an increased frequency of plants with a higher number of CC layers was observed in plants grown on medium containing 109 M BL than in plants grown with lower concentrations of BL. Similar obser - vations were previously reported in Col-0 plants treated with 4  109 M BL and the bes1-D BR gain-of-function mutant (Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ). Interestingly, this effect was not observed in BL-treated det2 plants ( Fig. 2B ). Treatment of BR-deficient det2 plants with higher concentrations of BL further increased the number of CSC layers and dramatically decreased the number of CC layers accordingly. These results strongly indicate that BRs differentially regulate distal CSC differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner: they inhibit the stem cell differentiation at low concentrations and promote it at higher concentrations. In support of data presented here, Col-0 plants grown on media containing BK, an inhibitor of BIN2 (a negative regulator of the BR signal - ling pathway) ( De Rybel et al, 2009 ) showed similar results to plants treated with lower concentrations of BL (data not shown). Also of note was that BL treatments not only mod - ulated CSC differentiation, as determined by counting the number of cell layers stained with PI or below the stained cells, but also weakened the intensity of PI staining ( Fig. 2D ). At the extreme, most Col-0 plants treated with 109 M BL had 13 cells in the lowest layers that were not stained at all. This result implies that BR may be involved in starch devel - opment as well as differentiation of the distal meristem. Next, to investigate the BRI1BZR1-dependent regulation of QC division and CSC differentiation, the frequency of QC, CSC, and CC layers in diverse BR-related mutant plants was examined. As previously reported ( Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ), bes1-D plants grown in MS media under the present experimental conditions showed enhanced QC reactivation and distal cell differentiation ( Fig. 2C , E). Twenty percent of En-2 plants had two layers of QC and the remaining 80 carried a single QC cell layer. In comparison, more than 70 of bes1-D plants harboured two-layered QCs. Moreover, the proportion of bes1-D plants with no CSC also dramatically increased. It was found that 52 of the bes1-D plants had single-layered CSCs and the rest had no CSC, while 83 of En-2 plants carried single-layered CSCs and the remaining 17 had two-layered CSCs. In accordance, the frequency of plants with higher CC layers was increased in the bes1-D in that 16 of the plants had five layers, 39 four layers, and 45 three layers. In comparison, En-2 plants showed 3 with five-layered, 27 with four-layered, and the remaining 70 with three-layered CCs. Comparing Col-0 plants with bri1-116 , bzr1-D , and bri1- 116bzr1-D plants, 17 of Col-0 plants had two-layered QCs and the remaining 83 showed single-layered QCs by 8 DAG on MS media ( Fig. 2C , E). In the same population of Col-0 plants, it was found that 90 of plants carried single- layered CSCs and a half developed four-layered CCs while the other half developed five-layered CCs. In comparison, the frequency of plants with single-layered QCs and CSCs in a BR-signalling defective mutant was slightly increased so that 98 of the bri1-116 plants carried single-layered QC or CSC. This implies that a defective BR signalling pathway may result in retardation of QC or CSC cell division or dif - ferentiation. Development of CCs was also slightly inhibited compared with the Col-0 plants: 20 of bri1-116 plants had five-layered, 72 four-layered, and the remaining 8 had three-layered CCs. Interestingly, a similar trend of reduction in CC layers was also observed in the BRZ-treated Col plants (data not shown). A BR-signalling enhanced mutant, bzr1- D, showed an increased frequency of plants with two-layered QCs as expected (80 with two-layered and the remaining 20 with single-layered plants). In addition, the frequency of plants with two-layered CSCs also dramatically increased (45 with two-layered and the rest with single-layered plants) as seen in the case of BL-treated Col-0 plants. Concurrently, the frequency of plants with fewer CC layers in the bzr1-D mutant was greatly increased in that 32 of the plants had four CC layers and the remaining 68 had three-layered CCs. A double mutant of the BR signal pathway, bri1-116 bzr1-D , had a similar frequency of plants with QC layers to bzr1-D and an intermediate frequency of plants with CSC and CC layers between bri1-116 and bzr1-1D . These results imply that differentiation of CSC and the resulting development of CC are under the control of the BRI1BZR1-mediated BR sig - nalling pathway, and that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, in opposition to BES1-mediated signalling, inhib - its the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying develop - ment of starch-filled columella cells. In addition, it seems that a defect in either BR biosynthesis (in the case of BRZ- treated Col plants) or in the signalling pathway (in the case of bri1-116) show similar results to BL treatment and BZR1- mediated signal enhancement. BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts on the auxin pathway and shows an antagonistic effect on auxin-stimulated CSC differentiation The auxin signalling pathway that stimulates differentiation of CSCs requires activation of auxin responding factors, ARF10 and ARF16 and subsequent restriction of WOX5 transcription in the QC ( Wang et al. , 2005 ; Ding and Friml, 2010 ). Based on these findings, whether the inhibitory effect 4842  Lee et al. of the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway involves inter - action with auxin activities in the distal area was examined. Ninety percent of Col-0 plants grown on MS media without exogenous BL carried a single-layered CSC and the remain - ing 10 of plants had two layers of CSCs ( Fig. 3A , B). In the same population, 23 of the Col-0 plants had five- or six-layered, 64 had four-layered, and 13 had three-layered CCs. As reported previously ( Ding and Friml, 2010 ), Col-0 seedlings grown on medium supplemented with an auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA) led to a decrease in CSC layers and a resulting increase in CC layers. For example, the frequency of plants with single-layered CSCs in NAA-treated Col-0 seedlings was greatly decreased to 52 from 90 in the untreated Col-0 plants. Moreover, 48 of the NAA-treated plants showed no CSC at all. Accordingly, the frequency of NAA-treated plants with more CC layers increased signifi - cantly: 30 of the auxin-treated plants carried six-layered CCs, 35 with five-layered, and the remaining 35 had four- layered CCs. Conversely, treatment of plants with an auxin action inhibitor (PEO-IAA, Y oshimoto et al. , 2012 ) increased plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers com - pared with those of Col-0 plants. It has been shown in BL-treated Col-0 and bzr1-D plants that the frequency of plants with a higher number of CSC layers was increased and the number of CC layers was decreased compared with those of Col plants ( Figs 2A C and 3A). However, NAA greatly negated the effects of the bzr1-D mutation, so that it led to a dramatic increase in the frequency of plants with fewer CSC layers and subsequent enhanced differentiation of CSC into CC layers, as in the case of Col-0 plants treated with the same chemicals ( Fig. 3A , B). For example, 32 of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried no CSC layer while only 6 of the untreated plants had no CSC layer. For CC layers, 58 of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried five-layered CSCs while only 5 were observed in untreated plants. In addition, treatment of PEO-IAA to the bzr1-D plants slightly augmented the bzr1-D mutation effect, so that the frequency of plants with more CSC lay - ers and with fewer CC layers was slightly increased compared with the untreated bzr1-D plants. For example, 45 of PEO- IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried two-layered CSCs while 31 of the untreated plants had two-layered CSCs. For CC layers, 72 of PEO-IAA-treated bzr1-D plants carried four- layered CSCs while this was observed in 66 of the untreated plants. Nonetheless, it was noticed that treatment of NAA or PEO-IAA to the bzr1-D plants did not completely lead to frequencies of CSC and CC layers observed in Col-0 plants treated by the same auxin-related chemicals. These results indicate that BZR1-mediated BR regulation on CSC differ - entiation and the following CC development partly act on the auxin action antagonistically, and a part of BZR1-mediated BR regulation for these developments may act in parallel to auxin. BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway alters the expressionsubcellular distribution of PIN proteins resulting in proximal relocation of the auxin localization domain in roots Auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and columella initials in the root tip where the auxin maximum is formed ( Blilou et al. , 2005 ). Disruption Fig. 3. BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts upstream of auxin in the regulation of CSC differentiation. (A) Effects of auxin-related chemicals on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Col-0 and bzr1-D plants. (B) Pictures of representative seedlings used for the cell layer measurement presented in (A). Seedlings were grown for 8 DAG on 12 MS agar media in the absence or presence of NAA (106 M) and PEO-IAA (2  105 M). The CSC and CC layers were identified as described in Fig. 2 . n50 seedlings for each treatment. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)BZR1-mediated QC division and suppression of columella stem cell differentiation  4843 of the auxin expression domain leads to defective develop - ment of the distal meristem ( Friml et al. , 2002 ). Based on the finding that BR acts antagonistically on auxin action in the regulation of CSC differentiation, whether BR modulates the auxin expression domain (auxin maximum) was exam - ined in the root tip using DR5::GUS and DR5::GFP plants as auxin-sensing reporters. To do this, roots were stained by performing either a GUS activity assay followed by mPS-PI staining to reveal cell walls and starch granules together with auxin-accumulating cells ( Fig. 4A , C), or regular PI staining with live tissues to reveal cell walls ( Fig. 4B ). Auxin gradually accumulated from the QC to the CCs with the highest con - centration at the CSC, CC1, and CC2 areas in most plants grown on MS medium without BL ( Fig. 4A ). About 35 of seedlings also showed auxin maximum at the root tip cells including the QC. Increasing the concentration of BL in the MS medium to 1010 M shifted this expression domain lon - gitudinally upward so that auxin was heavily concentrated at the QC, CSC, CC1, and the proximal area. For instance, more than 80 of BL (1010 M)-treated DR5::GUS seed - lings showed this pattern of auxin expression. Similarly, the DR5::GFP expression domain in bzr1-D plants and mx3 transgenic plants ectopically expressing the mutated form of BZR1 (pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP ) moved to the proximal area (Fig. 4B ). Consistent with the BL-driven proximal shift of the auxin maximum, BK treatment mimicking the BR-induced positive signalling pathway moved the auxin-accumulating domain to the proximal area, whereas treatment of the GUS reporter plants with BRZ reversed the BR effect on the maxi - mum movement ( Fig. 4C ). Interestingly, some DR5::GUS plants treated with 109 M BL resulted in enforced accumula - tion of auxin in the root tip area including the proximal zone, QC, and CCs ( Fig. 4A ). This is coincident with the finding that treatment of Col-0 plants with higher concentrations of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentia - tion and CC development compared with those induced by lower concentrations of BL ( Fig. 2A , D). As expected, the gradual expression of DR5::GUS and correct establishment of auxin maximum were dramatically abolished in plants grown in medium supplied with NAA, in which auxin was uniformly accumulated in all root tip areas at a high level (Fig. 4C ). Supplying BL together with the NAA in the growth medium did not reverse this tendency, thus a high amount of auxin remained through the root tip. The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradi - ent along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of the PIN proteins ( Grieneisen et al. , 2007 ). Specifically, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 play important roles in the positioning of auxin maximum and the following regu - lation of root patterning and distal meristem differentiation (Friml et al. , 2002 ; Blilou et al. , 2005 ). To examine whether BR modulates transcript expression and protein localiza - tion of PINs in the root tip area, BL was applied to the root of Col-0 and PIN reporter plants for 3 h or for 7 DAG and their gene expression and subcellular protein localization was examined. Interestingly, BL differentially regulated the Fig. 4. Proximal relocation of the auxin maximum resulting from BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway in root tips.

A similar down- regulation of PIN gene expression was also observed for plants growing on a MS solid medium containing 5  1010 M BL for a long period (7 DAG) ( Fig. 5B ). This regulation of PIN genes, especially for PIN4 , was dependent on BRI1- BZR1-mediated signalling pathways so that gene expression of PIN3 , PIN4 , and PIN7 was significantly enhanced in a bri1-116 background compared with the Col-0 plants. On the other hand, expression was significantly down-regulated (PIN4 ), slightly increased ( PIN3 ) without statistical sig - nificance, or maintained at the Col-0 control level ( PIN7 ) in Fig. 5. BL regulates expression of PIN genes in a concentration- and BZR1-dependent manner and induces changes in expression domain and subcellular localization of internalization of PIN proteins. (AC) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PIN genes in BL-treated Col-0 and BR-related mutant plants.

(This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)BZR1-mediated QC division and suppression of columella stem cell differentiation  4845 bzr1-D plants ( Fig. 5C ). Moreover, up-regulation of the PIN genes by bri1-116 mutation was partly negated by the bzr1- D mutation background in bri1-116 bzr1-D double mutants. This bzr1-D down-regulation effect of PIN genes resembles exogenous BL treatment at lower concentrations. In contrast, PIN7 expression was greatly increased in bes1-D mutants, which resembles the gene expression in plants treated with a higher concentration of BL. These results are consistent with the observation that BR has opposing effects on the differen - tiation of distal CSCs in concentration- and BZR1-BES1- dependent manners. Next, the PIN reporter plants were treated with BL, as done for the gene expression analysis, and PIN protein expres - sion and subcellular localization was examined ( Fig. 5D F). Without BL treatment, PIN3-GFP protein of pPIN3::PIN3- GFP plants in this experimental condition accumulated in the cell membrane of CSC and CC1 to the CC3 with predomi - nant expression in CC1 and CC2 ( Fig. 5D , F; upper panel). In contrast when BL was added to the incubation medium at a higher concentration (106 M) for 3 h, the PIN3 expres - sion domain was restricted mainly to CC1 and CC2 and disappeared from CC3. At the same time, the characteris - tic plasma membrane-localized PIN3 pattern was gradually diminished, and PIN3 appeared in endosome- or vesicle- like internal structures ( Fig. 5D ) at a frequency of 25 in mock-treated plants, which jumped to 65 in the BL-treated plants ( Fig. 5E ). Finally, growing PIN3 reporter seedlings on medium supplemented with 1010 M BL for 7 DAG resulted in a significant decrease in the number of PIN3 expression layers and intensity of the PIN3 protein expressed ( Fig. 5F ). For example, 44.4 of the reporter plants showed PIN3-GFP expression in 3 columella cell layers with high expression level while 27.8  expressed in 12 columella cell layers with low expression intensity. In contrast, BL-treated plants dis - played 36.8 of plants with expression in 3 columella cell layers with high or medium expression intensity, and 57.9 of plants showed expression in one columella cell layer with low expression intensity. PIN4-GFP protein showed a non - polar localization mainly in the membrane of CC1 to CC3 with prominent basal accumulation ( Fig. 5F ; middle panels). PIN7-GFP protein showed a similar expression pattern with prominent expression in CC2 ( Fig. 5F ; lower panel). Similar to the BL-treated PIN3::PIN3-GFP plants, treatment of BL (1010 M) to pPIN4::PIN4-GFP and pPIN7::PIN7-GFP plants for 7 DAG resulted in a reduction in expression layers and intensity of reporter proteins. In conclusion, the BR sig - nalling pathway modulates PIN gene expression and protein localization, which may lead to proximal relocation of the auxin maximum in the root tip. BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root- controlling genes in a BZR1-dependent manner Transcriptional regulation of many protein factors plays an important role in the establishment, maintenance, and differ - entiation of the root apical meristem (reviewed in Lee et al. , 2013 ). In this report, results have shown that BR-induced and BZR1-mediated signalling pathway regulates expression of several root-regulating genes including PINs and WOX5 . To have a better understanding of how BR regulates CSC dif - ferentiation, transcriptional expression of other key root-reg - ulating genes was examined in the presence or absence of BL. SOMBRERO (SMB) and FEZ proteins antagonistically regulate distal stem cell differentiation through transcrip - tional negative feedback regulation: FEZ promotes periclinal root cap-forming cell divisions and SMB negatively regu - lates FEZ activity, repressing stem cell-like divisions in the root cap daughter cells ( Willemsen et al. , 2008 ). Therefore, it was determined whether BR regulates expression of SMB and FEZ and whether the mode of this regulation is oppo - site for these genes. In Col-0 plants, BL up-regulated SMB expression whereas it down-regulated FEZ expression for short- and long-treatment with both low and high concentra - tions of BL ( Fig. 6A , B). In bri1-116 plants, SMB expres - sion was down-regulated but recovered to the level of Col-0 plants by introducing a bzr1-D mutation ( bri1-116 bzr1-D , Fig. 6C ). Given the fact that the smb-3 mutant has more CC layers and fez-2 has fewer CC layers ( Willemsen et al. , 2008 ), these results indicate that the BR-induced up-regulation of SMB and down-regulation of FEZ may contribute to the BR-induced and BZR1-mediated suppression of CSC dif - ferentiation. In support of this idea, FEZ expression was significantly down-regulated in bzr1-D plants. BEARSKIN 1 (BRN1) and BRN2, together with SMB, directly activate transcription of both vascular nac domain ( VND ) and nac secondary wall thickening promoting factor ( NST ) to regu - late cell maturation in the root cap, which undergoes termi - nal differentiation and detachment from the root ( Bennett et al. , 2010 ). The results showed that BR up-regulated BRN2 expression in Col-0 plants during both short- and long-term treatment, and that this was under the control of BRI1 BZR1-mediated gene expression ( Fig. 6A C). The expres - sion of BRN1 in Col-0 plants was not significantly changed by short-term treatment of BL, but was slightly decreased by prolonged treatment with 5  1010 M of BL. Interestingly, its expression was enhanced in bes1-D plants. Further studies are needed to carefully analyse how this regulation of gene expression is linked to BR- and BZR1-mediated root cap maturation. Since BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root-controlling genes in a BZR1 or BES1-dependent man - ner in this system, it was tested whether BZR1 or BES1 binds to the promoter of these genes in vivo by performing ChIP- qPCR analysis using pBZR1::BZR1-YFP and p35S::BES1- GFP plants. It was found that BRAVO and ERF115 contain at least one or two BZR1 andor BES1-binding motifs in their promoter regions ( Fig. 6D ), and this is consistent with the previous result showing that their expression was tightly con - trolled by BRI1BZR1-mediated signalling ( Fig. 1I ). PIN3 , PIN4 , and PIN7 genes contain at least one BZR1- and BES1- binding motif, and these results are strongly supported by a previous report demonstrating that BZR1 may bind to PIN3 , PIN4 , PIN7 as evidenced by ChIP microarray (ChIP-chip) performed using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the BZR1-CFP protein from the BZR1 promoter ( Sun et al. , 2010 ). The BRN1 gene had at least one BZR1 and BES1-binding 4846  Lee et al. motif ( Fig. 6D ), but their effect on gene expression was dif - ferent from each other ( Fig. 6C ). Taken together, these data indicate that BR-induced nuclear BZR1 regulates expression of several key root-controlling genes by binding to their pro - moters, which may be resulting in BR-induced modulation of root stem cell division and differentiation in the root tip area including columella cell layers. Discussion A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance. Previous studies proposed that QC cells might send short-range non- cell autonomous signals that help the initials remain in an undifferentiated state ( van den Berg et al. , 1997 ; Scheres, 2007 ). CSC initials and the differentiated columella cells are longitudinally adjacent to the QC. Results presented here showed that BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling path - ways acted differentially in the regulation of the QC and CSC differentiation (see Supplementary Figure S3 at JXB online for a schematic model). Both pathways promoted ectopic QC cell division by down-regulating expression of BRAVO repressor while at the same time up-regulating ERF115 , a positive regulator of QC division. In contrast, the effects of BRs in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of the distal meristem were both BZR1-BES1- and BL dose- dependent. The BRI1BZR1-mediated BR signalling path - way inhibited the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying the development of starch-filled columella cells. In contrast, BRI1BES1-mediated BR signalling showed opposite effects on differentiation of the distal meristem, as previously reported ( Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ). Similarly, applica - tion of low concentrations of exogenous BL ( 1010 M) resulted in the inhibition of CSC differentiation, similar to the results of the BRI1BZR1-mediated BR signalling path - way, while higher concentrations of BL (109 M) stimulated CSC differentiation as observed in BRI1BES1-mediated BR signalling. Similarly, bes1-D seedlings were resistant to BRZ (a BR biosynthetic inhibitor) in both dark- and light-grown conditions ( Yin et al. , 2002 ) whereas bzr1-D seedlings are resistant to BRZ in the dark but are hypersensitive in the light (Wang et al. , 2002 ). It has also been reported that BES1 acts Fig. 6. BR- and BZR1-mediated signalling pathway modulates transcriptional expression of diverse root-regulating genes. (AC) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of root-controlling genes in BL-treated Col-0 and BR-related mutant plants. Plants were grown and expression of root-regulating genes was analysed for short-term BL-treated plants (A), long-term BL-treated plants (B), and BL-related mutants (C) as described in Fig. 1G I. (D) ChIP-qPCR assay of the BZR1- and BES1- binding cis-motif of root-regulating genes. BZR1- and BES1-bound chromatin DNA fragments were isolated from roots of week-old Col-0, pBZR1::BZR1-YFP , and p35S::BES1-GFP plants using anti-BZR1 antibodies. Next, quantitative PCR analysis was performed with the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S2 as described in Materials and methods. Each primer set amplifies a region of the promoter simplified in Supplementary Figure S2 (available at JXB online) containing the BZR1-binding BRRE sequence (5 -CGTGTCG-3 , He et al., 2005 ) and E-box (5-CANNTG-3 , Yin et al., 2005 ). Promoters of UBC30 and PP2A genes were used as negative controls for BZR1- and BES1-binding motif. The promoter of DWF4 was used as a positive control ( Sun et al., 2010 ). All ChIP-qPCR analysis was repeated with a minimum of triple biological replicates and the data were statistically analysed by the Students t-test.BZR1-mediated QC division and suppression of columella stem cell differentiation  4847 as a transcriptional activator while BZR1 was shown to be a transcriptional repressor ( He et al. , 2005 ; Yin et al. , 2005 ). It is conceivable that differences in BZR1-BES1-dependent signalling dynamics provide the basis of the concentration- dependent differential responses. In fact, expression of distal CSC-regulating genes, such as FEZ and BRN1 , seem to be differentially regulated in bzr1-D and bes1-D plants. BRs interact with multiple hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of root growth and development ( Lee et al. , 2013 ; Zhu et al. , 2013 for review). Regarding the interaction with auxin, BRs act synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development by increasing acropetal auxin trans - port ( Bao et al. , 2004 ), and enhance plant tropic responses by promoting the accumulation of PIN2 from the root tip to the elongation zone ( Li et al. , 2005 ). Transcript profiling and ChIP-chip experiments have revealed that BZR1 binds to the promoters of many genes involved in auxin biosynthe - sis, transport, and signalling ( Sun et al. , 2010 ). It has been demonstrated that BRs down-regulate transcriptional expres - sion of PINs and change subcellular localization of their proteins, and thus may alter the auxin localization domain and subsequent root patterning. Supporting this model for BR-induced down-regulation of PIN genes in roots and the resulting antagonistic action of BR against auxin-induced CSC differentiation, it was recently proposed that oppositely patterned and antagonistic actions of BR and auxin maintain the stem cell balance and optimal root growth ( Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015 ). Epidermis-driven BR signalling and activ - ity is not associated with changes in the expression level of stele-localized PINs (PIN1 , PIN3 , and PIN7 ) (Hacham et al. , 2011 ), but modulates transcriptional expression of PIN2 and PIN4 and their accumulation in the epidermiscortex and columella in a post-transcriptional manner ( Hacham et al. , 2012 ). Thus, similar to the model proposed here, the authors proposed that BR-directed auxin distribution represents at least one mechanism that contributes to BR-mediated root growth. In particular, AtPIN4 mediates the sink-driven auxin gradient and the resulting auxin maximum in the QC and the columella initial, and thus controls signals for the QC to regulate auxin-driven root patterning. Consequently, the loss- of-function mutant Atpin4 exhibits a divided QC, increased number of both CSC and CC layers, and increased root cap and swelling ( Friml et al. , 2002 ). Recent studies showed that auxin-induced repression of WOX5 results in enhanced CSC differentiation ( Ding and Friml, 2010 ). The BL-treated plants and bzr1-D plants with enhanced BR signalling used here exhibited a decreased level of auxin in the distal root area and increased expression of WOX5 . Concomitantly, they exhibited reactivated QCs, an increased number of undifferentiated CSC layers, and a cor - responding decreased number of columella cell layers. In summary, these findings indicate that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibits auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation in Arabidopsis roots through action that is antagonistic to the auxinWOX5-dependent pathway. It is also possible that BR-driven nuclear BZR1 directly binds to the promoter of root-regulating genes such as PINs , BRAVO , ERF115 , FEZ , and BRN1 , and independently regulates QC division and the distal stem cell differentiation. Interestingly, abscisic acid (ABA) induces the expression of WOX5 and thus maintains quiescence of the QC and suppresses differentiation of the columella initials ( Zhang et al. , 2010 ). This phenomenon of ABA-induced WOX5 expression and promotion of stem cell maintenance is opposite to the BZR1-mediated WOX5 induction and reactivation of QC division in root tips that was observed in this study. Based on these apparently contradic - tory reports, it is highly plausible that differential regulation or mode of action of each hormone is involved in multiple cel - lular processes in distinctive root tissues or cell types, such as the QC, CSC, and CC. Therefore, it will be necessary to clarify their mode of action and interactomes by dissecting details of these regulatory frameworks and establishing their interaction with other hormones. It has been demonstrated that BZR1- mediated BR signalling and ETO1-promoted ethylene signal - ling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting this observation, treatment of ethylene biosynthetic precursor ACC promoted QC divi - sion without promoting BZR1 nuclear accumulation in the QC ( Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015 ). Decoding the BR-dependent regulatory network in a cell- type specific manner remains a significant challenge, and any information will be useful in mapping BR interactomes with different pathways and uncovering how distinct tissues are coordinated ( Fridman and Savaldi-Goldstein, 2013 ). Here, it has been shown that the effects of BRs in the regulation of QC and distal meristem activities are both BL dose- and BZR1- BES1-dependent. Nonetheless, when and how BRs control stem cell maintenance and differentiation in roots remains largely unknown. Therefore, future studies must clearly dis - sect the connections among the dose-dependent perception of BR signals in a cell or tissue, the downstream signalling mole - cules, and the subsequent developmental patterning occurring in roots. Traditionally, an ARF-binding DR5 -based auxin- inducible reporter ( Ulmasov et al. , 1997 ; Barbez et al. , 2013 ) and an AuxIAA-based auxin signalling sensor (DII-VENUS; Brunoud et al. , 2012 ) have been widely used to accurately map auxin response and distribution at high spatiotemporal resolu - tion in a single-cell-based tobacco system and in planta . Thus, one useful approach would be to develop BR-specific sensors (reporters) and monitor real-time spatiotemporal changes in BR abundance in a cell or a tissue and perform computa - tional modelling to establish BR distribution circuits during the developmental progress. In addition, the identification of BR-regulated target genes in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental time and clarifying their interactive regulation by other hormones will provide another level of understand - ing of BR-regulated meristem function in plants.

        "introduction": "The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding mer - istemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella ini - tials), which form a stem cell niche (SCN) ( Supplementary Figure S1 available at JXB online; Bennett and Scheres, This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:creativecommons.orglicensesby3.0), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Experimental Biology. 4836  Lee et al. 2010 ). Each initial cell gives rise to the different root tissues, being the outermost lateral root cap, epidermis, ground tissue (cortex and endodermis), pericycle, and the innermost vascu - lar tissues to make up a radial arrangement of root tissues. Along the longitudinal axis, the root is composed of a distal structure lateral root cap and columella layers derived from the columella stem cell initials (CSCs), the SCN, proximal meristem, transition zone, elongation zone, and differentia - tion zone ( Perilli and Sabatini, 2010 ; Lee et al. , 2013 ). This cylinder-like concentric root structure is established by a balance between cell division in initials, stem cells, and mer - istematic cells of the proximaldistal meristems, and differen- tiation of these cells into diverse cell types in the elongation differentiation zone. This balance is under the tight control of unknown QC-directed signals and environmental cues that regulate the spatiotemporal expression of master regulatory genes for cell fate determination ( Scheres, 2007 ; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011 ). In general, when asymmetric division of a stem cell initial occurs, the daughter cell that has contact with the QC remains as an initial cell whereas the other daughter cellwhich is separate from the QCdivides to form transit- amplifying cells at the boundary of the proximal meristem (Scheres, 2007 ; Perilli et al. , 2012 ). Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed in Bennett and Scheres, 2010 ; Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011 ; Lee et al. , 2013 ). Among them, auxin is a major cell fate-instructive hormone that is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and CSCs at the root tip to form an auxin maximum (Friml et al. , 2003 ; Blilou et al. , 2005 ). The auxin maximum specifies the hypophysis and the QC and regulates formation of the root meristem ( Sabatini et al. , 1999 ). The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of auxin carrier proteins including the pin-formed (PINs) ( Grieneisen et al. , 2007 ). Antagonistic regulation of PIN phosphoryla - tiondephosphorylation by the pinoid (PID) protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively, directs topological patterning of PINs and the subsequent auxin flux (Michniewicz et al. , 2007 ). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are polyhydroxylated steroid hor - mones that play pivotal roles in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes ( Zhu et al. , 2013 ). Upon bind - ing of a BR to its receptor, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) forms a heterodimeric complex with bri1-associated receptor kinase1somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase3 (BAK1SERK3)( Bcherl et al. , 2013 ), and the fully activated BRI1BAK1 complex then initiates a signalling cascade that activates the positively acting transcription factors brassina - zole resistant 1BRI1 EMS suppressor 2 (BZR1BES2) and BZR2BES1 to regulate expression of a wide range of genes and the subsequent plant growth and development ( He et al. , 2005 ; Sun et al. , 2010 ; Yu et al. , 2011 ). BR-induced nuclear localization of BZR1BES1 is crucial for BR activities ( Wang et al. , 2002 ; Yin et al. , 2002 ), and this localization is depend - ent on the phosphorylation and 14-3-3 modification status of the BZR1BES1 proteins ( Gampala et al. , 2007 ; Ryu et al. , 2007 ; Ryu et al. , 2010 ). Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) is a GSK3Shaggy-like kinase that phosphorylates BZR1 BES1, thus acting as a negative regulator of the BR signal transduction pathway ( Li and Nam, 2002 ; Yan et al. , 2009 ). In contrast, PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 and abolishes BZR1 binding to the 14-3-3- proteins to activate BR-responsive gene expression and plant growth ( Tang et al. , 2011 ). BRs regulate root growth in a concentration-dependent manner: they promote root growth at low concentrations and inhibit it at high concentrations ( Mssig et al. , 2003 ; Kim et al. , 2007 ). They also play a regulatory role in the control of cell cycle progression and differentiation in the Arabidopsis root meristem: plants treated with BR or mutants with enhanced BR signalling, such as bes1-D , show prema - ture cell cycle exit that results in early differentiation of mer - istematic cells ( Gonzalez-Garcia et al. , 2011 ). In addition, BRs promote QC division and differentiation of distal stem cells. In fact, the BRI1-like 3 (BRL3) signalosome complex containing BAK1 and BRL1 modulates root growth and development by contributing to the cellular activities of pro - vascular and QC cells ( Fbregas et al. , 2013 ). Recently two BR transcriptional targets brassinosteroids at vascular and organizing centre (BRA VO) and ethylene response fac - tor 115 (ERF115)regulating QC quiescence in opposite ways have been identified ( Heyman et al. , 2013 ; Vilarrasa- Blasi et al. , 2014 ). BRA VO acts as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions, and BR-regulated BES1 counteracts its action by directly repressing and physically interacting with the BRA VO ( Vilarrasa-Blasi et al. , 2014 ). ERF115 induces QC cell division by acting through phytosulfokines 5 (PSK5) signalling, and BR drives QC proliferation by stimulating ERF115 expression ( Heyman et al. , 2013 ). Here it is revealed that BR-induced accumulation of BZR1 in the root tips and down-regulationre-localization of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 proteins may result in changes in auxin distri - bution and the resulting auxin maximum area. This alteration in the auxin localization domain together with gene expres - sion regulation of BRAVO , ERF115 , and other root-regulat - ing genes may lead to ectopic activation of QC division and suppression of CSC differentiation. It is also demonstrated that BR and the related BZR1-BES1-mediated signalling pathways have opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Arabidopsis roots in a BR concentration-dependent and a signalling molecule-dependent manner. Materials and methods Plant materials and growth conditions Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0, Col-0), its ethylene biosynthesis mutant eto1-11 and BR-related mutants ( det2, bri1-116 , bzr1-D , and bri1-116 bzr1-D ), and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Enkheim-2, En-2) and its mutant bes1-D plants were used for QC, CSC, and columella cell (CC) phenotype analysis and root-regulat - ing gene expression analysis. pBZR1::BZR1-YFP and p35S::BES1- GFP plants were used for BZR1 subcellular localization study and ChIP-qPCR assays. Promoter-driven reporter seeds were kindly provided by Dr Wang at Carnegie Institution for Science, USA (pBZR1::BZR1-YFP , pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP , and 35S::BES1-GFP ); BZR1-mediated QC division and suppression of columella stem cell differentiation  4837 Dr Laux at the University of Freiburg, Germany ( pWOX5::GFP ); Dr Benfey at Duke University, USA ( pSCR::SCR-GFP ); Dr Guilfoyle at University of Missouri, Columbia, USA ( DR5::GFP and DR5::GUS ); Dr Friml at Ghent University, Belgium ( pPIN3::PIN3- GFP , pPIN4::PIN4-GFP , and pPIN7::PIN7-GFP ); and Dr Scheres at Ultrecht University, The Netherlands ( pCo2::YFP H2B, and J2341 ). The following plants were generated: bzr1-D x pWOX5::GFP , bzr1- D x pSCR::SCR-GFP , bzr1-D x pC O2::YFP H2B, DR5::GFP x bzr1- D, and DR5::GFP x mx3 (pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP ). These reporter seedlings were used to trace expression and behaviour of the fusion proteins under the confocal laser-scanning microscope. Seeds were surface-sterilized by sequential washing with 70 EtOH0.1 Triton X-100 for 20 min, 70 EtOH for 10 min, and 95 EtOH for 10 min. Seeds were dried on a clean bench and cold- treated in the dark at 4 C for 72 h. These sterilized seeds were then sown on 12 MS agar medium containing 0.8 phytoagar (pH 5.7) in the presence or absence of the indicated chemicals. Plants were grown in a growth chamber operating under a cycle of 16 h light and 8 h dark at 2325 C with 70 humidity. All seedlings were grown vertically. Chemicals Brassinolide (BL) and X-GLUC were purchased from Duchefa (The Netherlands) and MB Cell (USA), respectively. All other chemi - cals used in this report were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) unless otherwise indicated. Brassinazole (BRZ), bikinin (BK), and -(phenyl ethyl-2-one)-IAA (PEO-IAA) were kindly provided by Dr Y oshida (RIKEN, Japan), Dr Beeckman (Ghent University, Belgium), and Dr Hayashi (Okayama University of Science, Japan), respectively. Histochemical staining For propidium iodide (PI) staining (reported in Figs 1 and 5), roots were incubated for 30 min in PI (5 gml), rinsed, and mounted in H2O before confocal microscopic observation. Staining and detection of -glucuronidase (GUS) activity was performed according to the method of Jefferson (1987) , with some modifications. In brief, roots were fixed in 90 acetone for 20 min and infiltrated with staining buffer 0.1 M phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM K 4Fe(CN) 63H 20, and 1 mgml X- GLUC. The resulting stained root tissues were then fixed and processed as described in mPS-PI staining method. mPS-PI staining was performed according to the method of Truernit et al. (2008) with some modifications to reveal cell shape, the presence of starch granules, and auxin maximum (described in Figs 2 , 3 and 4). In brief, roots were fixed in fixative (50 metha - nol and 10 acetic acid) and then incubated in 1 periodic acid after rinsing with water. Next, the tissues were treated with modified Pseudo Schiff reagent (100 mM sodium metabisulphite and 0.15N HCl, supplemented with freshly added PI to a final concentration of 100 gml). The samples were transferred onto microscope slides and covered with a chloral hydrate solution (4 g chloral hydrate, 1 ml glycerol, and 2 ml water) for 5 min to observe fluorescence or reflec - tion signals using the Zeiss Confocal microscope. Confocal microscopy PI, YFPGFP, and GUS signals were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an argon 2 ion laser (488 nm) and a HeNe 1 ion laser (543 nm). For observa - tion of PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 543 nm to collect the PI signal at 595615 nm or excited at 488 nm to detect GFP sig - nal at 493545 nm or YFP signal at 521560 nm. For observation of mPS-PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 488 nm and the emis - sion was collected at 520720 nm to detect the PI signal. The stained signal for GUS activity was obtained using the reflection mode of the confocal microscope. In this case, the excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and the reflection signal was collected at 485491 nm. Images were compiled and analysed using the LSM 710 ZEN image browser software. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from root tissues using the Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea) and treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega, USA) according to the manufactur - ers instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was per - formed by the SYBR green method using the Applied Biosystems Step One Plus System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The expression of each transcript was normalized against the amount of UBC1 control in each sample. CPD was used as a control for BR-repressed genes. The results were reported as expression relative to the Col-0 mock control ( Figs 1G , 1H, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B) or Col-0 or En-2 genetic control ( Figs 1I , 5C, and 6C). Three to five biological rep - licates were included in each experiment, and the data were sta - tistically analysed using the Students t-test. Primers used for the qRT-PCRs are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 (available at JXB online). ChIP-qPCR assay ChIP experiments were performed as previously described with minor modifications ( Gendrel et al. , 2005 ) using the non-transgenic Columbia-0, plants expressing native promoter-driven BZR1-GFP (pBZR1::BZR1-YFP ), and plants constitutively expressing BES1- GFP ( p35S::BES1-GFP ). In brief, week-old seedlings were cross- linked with 1 formaldehyde and the chromatin DNA fragments (500 bp in length) were isolated from their nuclei of root tissues to retrieve BZR1 or BES1-binding DNA fragments using rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam, UK). The bound DNA fragments were then extracted using the GelPCR DNA frag - ments extraction kit (RBC Bioscience, Korea) and the amount of the bound DNA was measured by performing real-time PCRs with the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S2 (available at JXB online) using equal amounts of DNA from the input and the CoIP fractions.",
