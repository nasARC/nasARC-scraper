These microbial communities fulfill essential roles in pathogen protection1, immune system education2, production of vitamins3, metabolism of xenobiotics4,5and increase the plasticity of their hosts to respond to evolutionary challenges6,7. Thus, the composition of the microbiota plays an important role in the well-being of hosts and its ability to respond to environmental challenges8,9, as indicated by the frequent shift of microbiota composition observed in the context of diseases10and exposure to environmental stressors11. These observations and work in animal models have led to the development of the notion that the composition of the microbiome itself might be an important modulator of host health12as well as fitness and that a targeted modulation of microbiome composition might offer a completely new avenue for modulating the host. It has been shown that dietary patterns (e.g., western diet) can affect the structure of the microbiome, however their effect is transient13. Besides an influence of dietary uptake on microbiome composition, various approaches to modify the microbial communities of organisms have been used14: the transfer of entire microbial communities from a donor to a recipient host (fecal transfer), the provision of compounds used by particular microbial species (prebiotics), the provision of microbial strains of natural or synthetic origin (probiotics), the provision of compounds of microbial origin (postbiotics) and combinations thereof (synbiotics). While fecal transfer is the most commonly used approach to modulate microbial community composition in animal models, it involves the transfer of entire microbial communities and therefore not only desirable traits. In consequence, there is only a single medical indication in which fecal transfers are routinely used thus far15and there are potential concerns about the safety and stability of the engraftment of transplants16. Although the concept of supplementation with pre-, pro- or synbiotics has been commonly proposed as a method of microbial manipulation, these approaches are still severely limited. In.

Another important aspect to consider is the specificity with which individual target microorganisms can be manipulated using prebiotics. Thus, while oligosaccharides are considered beneficial there is often uncertainty about which species can degrade them, as multiple, unrelated species can degrade similar types of oligosaccharides (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacterium species can degrade fructans)17,18. In case of supplementation with probiotics and synbiotics, other concerns have been raised. For instance, the ability of specific Bifidobacteria to stably colonize the human gut was only reported for  of the participants in a clinical trial19. Moreover, introducing exogenous bacteria can have unwanted side effects. For example, some of theBacillus species which were used as probiotics in aquacultures were found to carry virulence and antibiotic resistance genes20. Hence, to overcome these limitations in current microbiome manipulation approaches, we need to focus on prebiotics with well-controlled modes of action (e.g., microbial pathways of prebiotics degradation) that preferentially modulate the abundance of resident microbial species. Since mechanisms of pathogenicity are often complex and context specific21, it is preferred if these species are native to the microbiome of the host, as unwanted side-effects due to the introduction of foreign bacterial species might be avoided. Within this work, we will refer to prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of selected bacterial strains within the microbiome of a specific host as precision prebiotics. To design and evaluate such precision prebiotics, it is essential to start with a tractable model system such as the well-established model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The native microbial community of the invertebrate C. elegans was first described in 201622, yet the nematode has already been used for over twenty years as a model for studying host-microbial interactions23. To similarly promote C. elegans-microbiome research, a synthetic 12-member C. elegans-specific microbiome resource, CeMbio, was recently established22. Part of this consortium is the Gram-negative Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 that is known to possess antifungal24and. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Besides its protective effects, MYb11 is known to colonize and persist in the C. elegans intestine22and thus increase the nematodes fitness during infection25.Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 is another member of the CeMbio community22and affects different host life-history traits 22,26, persistently colonizes the nematode24, and has been described as competitive against other bacteria in terms of space and nutrients27. Both bacteria are also able to interact metabolically with the nutrient environment determining their type of interaction27. Hence, a microbial community consisting of one beneficial bacterium and another one that is competitive offers an excellent opportunity for developing targeted approaches for microbiome manipulation. A key prerequisite for the development of precision prebiotics is a detailed understanding of the metabolic functions present within a microbial community and how specific metabolic interventions affect microbiome metabolism. One important approach to investigate metabolic functions in microbial communities are constraint-based metabolic modeling approaches2830. Based on the genetic information either on the level of each bacterium or from the overall community and biochemical databases, these methods allow one to simulate the network of chemical reactions that represent the metabolic reactions of the microorganism(s) or the community31. To this end, genome-scale metabolic models of the bacterial species within a microbiome have to be reconstructed from genomic data. These models summarize the metabolic functions present within an organism and can be reconstructed using automated reconstruction approaches32,33or obtained from existing model repositories34. Furthermore, accounting for the growth environment of a species35, optimization approaches such as flux balance analysis (FBA) for individual species 28or constraint-based community modeling approaches36,37can be used to predict metabolic activities within individual species as well as interactions between species. These methods have already been used to identify metabolic alterations in the microbiome of Parkinsons disease patients38as well as patients with inflammatory bowels disease39,27and to study the interaction of C. elegans as well as its microbiota in the context of drug-microbiome-host interactions30. For C. elegans, metabolic models of the CeMbio community including MYb11 and MYb7122and other members of the microbiota are available27.. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

We tested four of the predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vitro and confirmed that they selectively boost the abundance of MYb11. Moving to the C. elegans host system, we moreover showed that L-serine is able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 when the C. elegans host was colonized with both bacterial species. Thus, we demonstrate that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches could represent a key tool for the design of targeted microbiome intervention approaches. 4.Material and Methods a. Computational Methods Identification of unique uptake compounds We explored to what extent individual metabolites, which are only taken up by a single bacterial species and no other, could serve as potential supplements to target individual species. To this end, we considered gut microbiome data from a Kiel-based human cohort comprising 1280 participants for which 16S rRNA gene sequencing data is available, which we had utilized previously30. As reported previously, the reads were mapped to the 16S sequences of the genomes of bacterial species present in the AGORA bacterial collection34, the read counts of each sample were normalized to a sum of 1 and removal of species below 0.1 abundance in each sample. We used gapseq version 1.132on the genomes of the identified species assuming the averaged dietary uptake of the human cohort30as input to the models to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models. Subsequently, we identified for each bacterial species which metabolites can be taken up. To this end, we minimized the flux through each exchange reaction using flux balance analysis (FBA)40implemented in the R-package sybil41which corresponds to maximizing the uptake of that metabolite. If the minimal flux through the exchange reaction was non-zero this metabolite could be taken up. Having identified those compounds for each species,. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Finally, we determined for each participant which fraction of the bacterial species contained in the gut microbiome had at least one unique uptake compound. Similarly, we reconstructed 78 bacterial models belonging to the C. elegans microbiota based on their published genomes27using gapseq version 1.232. We then created random subsets of the models with increasing size (from 2 to 78, 50 iterations for each size) and determined the portion of strains with unique uptake compounds for each community. For the CeMbio community we used metabolic models reconstructed with gapseq 1.232from Zimmermann et al. (in preparation). Computational supplementation experiments In our simulations, we utilized metabolic networks of Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 that were created from their genome sequences27using gapseq32 version 1.1. Information from phenotypic microarrays about the organisms metabolic capacities was integrated into the models using the adapt module of gapseq. Specifically, we incorporated data from the Biolog EcoPlate (assuming growth if OD590 - OD750  0.1)22. During growth simulations, exchange fluxes of the models were constrained by assuming a computational Nematode Growth Medium (NGM)30and aerobic conditions. These constraints can be found in Supplementary File (Sheet: S1). Additionally, the inflow of copper and iron cations was increased, so that they did not restrict the growth of the models. We used three distinct approaches for modeling individual microbes and microbial communities. To model the growth of each bacterium independently, we used FBA40. We also utilized individual-based modeling based on BacArena36R-package and a community-FBA as described previously39,42,43.The community-FBA approach is implemented in the R-package MicrobiomeGS2 (www.github.comWaschinaMicrobiomeGS2). In all types of simulations, we focused on the identification of nutritional supplements that boosted the growth of the target species MYb11.. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

This is based on the assumption that the uptake rate of compounds is depicted by its maximum available amount36. Supplementations for each metabolite were conducted by increasing the possible influx of the supplemented metabolite by 10 mmolgDWhr. For testing the effects of supplements on single growth, the relative increase in growth rate compared to growth without supplement for each model was recorded. To prevent any numerical instabilities, all raw values were rounded to the sixth digit and relative changes bigger than 0.01 were taken into account. For simulations using community FBA, the metabolic models of both organisms were merged into one microbial community model. Please note that we did not use a fixed community biomass composition as previously30, since we employed community FBA to predict the resulting growth rates of individual species after maximizing the growth of the community. Thus, the community model was constrained with the NGM diet - extended with the individual supplements, as described in the previous paragraph. The growth rates of individual species were predicted by maximizing the sum of the growth rates of individual species with concomitant minimization of the sum of total fluxes as implemented in the R-package sybil41(with a coefficient of -10-6for the sum of fluxes in the objective function). Since the supplementations usually also increased the growth of the entire community, the predicted growth rates of each species were normalized with the respective growth rate of the community. Predicted growth rates following supplementation were contrasted against growth rates without supplementation to identify compounds whose effect was larger for the growth of MYb11 in comparison to MYb71. To exclude any numerical artifacts, rounding to the sixth digit and a cut-off of 0.01 in compound selection were also applied in this section. For individual-based modeling of microbial communities, the metabolic models of both species were simulated in a virtual environment in BacArena, where they could randomly move and reproduce36on a 30 x 30 grid. As a growth medium we used the NGM diet (in mM) which we. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

For the simulations, we inoculated the growth environment with 20 individuals of each species and simulated bacterial growth for 12 iterations with 15 replicates for each supplementation using FBA. A secondary objective to minimize the total flux while maximizing growth rates of individuals was applied. To simulate the supplementation experiments, 0.01 mM of each compound of interest was added once in the beginning of the simulation. To identify significant changes in the growth profiles of individual species following each supplementation, we extracted the cell biomass information from the simulations using the command plotGrowthCurve and we calculated the relative change of the total biomass values (time step 13; rounding to the sixth digit) due the supplementations for each model. Then, the relative changes between the bacterial models were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests44. The resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate control implemented in R. We selected those compounds whose effect on MYb11 was larger than on MYb71 based on the median of the respective relative changes for each model. Based on these simulation techniques, we identified those compounds that specifically boosted MYb11 across the simulations. Subsequently, we subsetted this list to compounds for which we had positive confirmation of their uptake by MYb11 from Biolog experiments22,27. For the enrichment analysis of growth-supporting compounds of MYb11, we used the human metabolome database (HMDB) annotation for the available metabolite classes45. Briefly, we tested whether the sets of candidate compounds were enriched in the metabolite classes defined in HMDB using Fishers exact test. As the underlying set of metabolites, we used the metabolites contained in the metabolic model of MYb11 in the different metabolite classes. System information and software Simulations and analyses were performed in the Renvironment (versions 4.0.0, 4.0.3, and 4.2.1). Model reconstructions were performed with the gapseq software (versions 1.1 and 1.2)32 Optimisations were generally conducted using the software sybil (versions 2.1.5 and 2.2.0)41..

Both incorporate sybil in their pipelines. The linear programming solver was CPLEX (version 12.10.0, 22.1.0), based on the R package cplexAPI (version 1.4.0). For data management, the software dplyr (version 1.0.2, 1.0.4, and 1.0.9), tidyr (version 1.1.3), tidyverse (version 1.3.2)46, and data.table (version 1.14.2) were used. For parallel computing, the software foreach (version 1.5.0 and 1.5.1) and doMC (version 12.10.0) were used. For plotting, the software ggplot2 (versions 3.3.3 and 3.3.6)47,egg(version 0.4.5), and ggVennDiagram (version 1.2.2.) were utilized. Ethics statement The human cohort data that was used in this study originate from the publication of Pryor and colleagues30, whose access was provided by the PopGen biobank (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) 48. The raw data is available from the biobank through a structured application procedure (https:www.uksh.dep2nInformationforResearchers.html). b. Experimental Methods Bacterial strains To determine bacterial growth in mono- and co-culture either in the presence or absence of supplementation, similarly to the computational section, the two naturally associated Caenorhabditis elegans microbiota isolates Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 were used. Fluorescently labeled MYb11::dTomato21and MYb71::GFP were used to distinguish the two bacterial species in a mixed community. For comparison, reverse labels were also tested, using MYb71::dTomato and MYb11::sfGFP, to ensure no impact of the fluorescent label (Supplementary Figure S2). Integrated fluorescent strains of MYb71 and the MYb11::sfGFP strain were constructed by transposon insertion at the attTn7 site following published work49. Briefly, two populations of E. coli SM10 strains were prepared: (i) a donor strain containing either pTn7xKS-sfGFP (pTW415) or pTn7xKS-dTomato (pTW416) plasmids, and (ii) a helper strain containing the pTNS2 (pTW10) plasmid.

Tripartite mating mixtures consisted of equal parts (1:1:1), incubated overnight at 26 C, followed by selection on LB agar plates containing gentamicin (10 ugmL) and IPTG (1mM). Fluorescent colonies of MYb71 were verified by PCR and sequencing using 2 pairs of MYb71-specific primers to the glmS gene region: (i) oDB097 (5-CGCTCTGATCGATGAGACC-3) and oDB098 (5-TTGCGCGGCTGRTCGAC-3), and (ii) oDB097 and a transposon WP11 primer (5-CACGCCCCTCTTTAATACGA-3)49. MYb11::sfGFP was similarly confirmed by PCR and sequencing, following our previous protocol21. Bacteria were thawed from frozen stocks for each experiment, streaked to tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and grown for 16 h to 42 h at 25 C. Bacterial cultures of MYb11 and MYb71 were grown in liquid nematode growth medium (liquid NGM) overnight at 28 C in a shaking incubator. Cultures were adjusted to OD 600 0.5 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and co-cultures were obtained by mixing equal volumes of the adjusted cultures. Supplementation in vitro L-serine (1714.1), D-mannitol (8883.1), and L-threonine (T206.1) were purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), and GABA (A2129) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and dissolved to 1 M or 0.5 M stocks in water, depending on the maximum soluble concentration. Liquid NGM was supplemented with a final concentration of 10 mM of the respective supplement. For supplementation assays in vitro, 5 l of either mono- or co-culture of the bacteria was added to 95 l of liquid NGM in a 96-well plate, in the presence or absence of supplement. Treatments were randomized with respect to plate layout. Plates were incubated at 28 C for 24 h in an Epoch2 BioTek plate reader with double orbital shaking at 807 CPM. To quantify the colony forming units (CFU) 7 l of different dilutions of each treatment bacterial suspension of respective mono- or co-cultures were plated on TSA plates. The plates were stored at 25 C and colonies scored after 24 h to 48 h. Statistical calculations and plots were performed with R studio software (version 4.1.3). For all CFU assays in vitro, statistical comparisons were performed with Wilcoxon signed rank tests44.. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Worms were maintained on NGM plates inoculated with Escherichia coli OP50 at 20 C following standard procedures50. Assay plates were prepared by adding L-serine at a concentration of 0 mM, 10 mM, or 100 mM to NGM. Overnight cultures of MYb11 and MYb71 were adjusted to OD 600 2.0 in PBS. 30-40 synchronized first instar larvae (L1) were grown on supplemented NGM plates inoculated with 125 l of respective mono- or co-culture of MYb11 and MYb71. After 72 hours, bacterial lawns were sampled by pressing the circular end of a 200 l pipette tip into the lawn, avoiding the edges and any worms. The resulting disc was homogenized in PBS with zirconia beads in a Bead Ruptor 96 (Omni International) for 3 minutes at 30 Hz. To assess the number of CFU, worms were washed off plates using M9-buffer  0.025 Triton X-100, washed 5 times and paralyzed with 5 mM tetramisole to stop pumping of the worms as described in22. Worms were surface-sterilized following22, then washed 2 times in PBS to remove residual bleach. Worms were transferred to a new tube to determine the exact worm number (20) and PBS was added to a final volume of 400 ml. Worms were allowed to settle and 100 l supernatant was collected (supernatant control). Worms were homogenized in the remaining PBS using 1-mm zirconia beads in a Bead Ruptor 96 for 3 minutes at 30 Hz. Homogenized worms, lawns, and supernatants were serially diluted in PBS and plated on TSA plates. After up to 48 h at 25 C, the colonies were scored at the appropriate dilutions and the CFUs per worm were calculated. Each colonization experiment was conducted in three independent runs and equal biological replicates. Data were pooled across runs, and a mixed model controlling for runs was used to assess the effect of L-serine supplementation on bacterial colonization in C. elegans. For all L-serine in vitro and in vivo experiments, statistical comparisons were performed with generalized linear models, if not otherwise mentioned.

Hence, these compounds correspond to unique metabolic niches for the respective bacterial species. We initially tested computationally whether such unique uptake compounds typically exist in bacterial communities, using bacterial communities from a human cohort as well as C. elegans30. We evaluated for each bacterial species of a particular community whether it was able to take up a metabolite that no other species of the community could take up and determined the fraction of bacterial species in the community that had such unique uptake compounds (see Methods). For the human cohort, the bacterial communities comprised on average 26-34 bacterial species (25 to 75 quantiles). Within this community size, on average, 5 to 20 of bacterial species were inferred to possess unique uptake compounds that could potentially be used to target those species. For smaller communities, up to 50 of bacterial species and for larger communities, only 5 to 10 had unique uptake compounds (Figure 1A). Similarly, in the C. elegans model system, we observed that the possibility of finding a unique compound quickly dropped with the size of the bacterial community. Thus, within a sample of 78 bacterial species isolated from C. elegans, we usually only identified 3-5  of species with unique uptake compounds in communities comprising 30 or more bacterial species, which is the typical size of bacterial communities observed in C. elegans-derived microbiome samples51(Fig. 1B). Similarly, in the artificial CeMbio C. elegans model microbiome community unique uptake compounds could usually only be detected for subsets of bacterial species up to a size of six (Fig. 1C). Thus, in a typical microbiome like those analyzed above, we would expect to be able to identify unique uptake compounds only for a minority of bacterial species and compounds to target specific bacterial species are typically expected to be consumed by several species.

Empty squares represent cases where no growth was observed in Biolog data. Missing squares indicate compounds not present on Biolog plates. Computational identification of precision prebiotics targeting Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 In order to derive precision prebiotics for Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, we used its metabolic network as input for flux balance analysis and two distinct community modeling approaches apart from the basic approach of FBA. The first one is based on BacArena that incorporates an individual-based modeling approach and the other one is so-called community FBA implemented in MicrobiomeGS2. These two modeling approaches differ in their underlying assumptions. In BacArena the two bacteria are modeled by their individual metabolic networks and fluxes are predicted by maximizing the growth rate of individual bacteria. In community FBA, in turn, the metabolic networks of the individual bacterial species are merged into a community model for which the sum of growth rates of both bacterial species are maximized. Thus, when using BacArena, metabolic interactions between species typically arise from one species secreting an end-product that another species can metabolize. In community FBA, in turn, the optimization of total growth assumes that bacterial species coordinate their metabolic fluxes so that overall growth is maximized. Using FBA, we identified 29 compounds that could increase the growth of MYb11 in single growth. Employing the community modeling approaches, we identified 81 compounds that increased the growth of MYb11 over MYb71 in community FBA and 17 compounds using BacArena. In order to determine whether specific compound classes were enriched among the MYb11-supporting compounds, we performed an enrichment based on HMDB annotation45across the three different.

We found that growth-supporting compounds for MYb11 were enriched for amino acids (Fishers exact test p-value2.2x10-2) and fatty acids (Fishers exact test p-value3.16x10-5). Interestingly, the growth dynamics of the models when they were part of a community model (Figure 2B) differ from the growth dynamics of the models when they were treated as individual organisms (Figure 2C). For instance, MYb71s growth rate was much higher in the community model, i.e., when coupled to the model MYb11. This is a typical observation when using community FBA when the growth rate of the entire community is maximized. Especially for small communities, this often leads to one community member that most efficiently turns the growth medium into biomass to grow strongest with only little growth for other community members. On the other hand, in the BacArena simulations, we observed that most of those compounds boosted the growth of both species in single growth, however, the effect was larger for MYb11 than MYb71 (Figure 2C). Of the identified compounds, 17 compounds were shared across the three simulations. For eight of these, uptake by MYb11 was also supported by Biolog plates22,27(Figure 2D). Based on the available literature information on the role of these compounds in longevity of the host52,53or physiology54, as nutritional compounds22,55, or compounds that are involved in host-microbial interactions54,56, we selected four candidates for further experimental testing as precision prebiotics to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11 based. In vitro validation of predicted precision prebiotics We experimentally tested the ability of four of the predicted precision prebiotics compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, GABA, and D-mannitol, to specifically increase the growth of MYb11 in co-culture with MYb71. L-serine is a dietary amino acid that has been involved in nutrition-drug-host-microbial interactions56and can support the lifespan of the host53, L-threonine, an essential amino acid55, through its catabolite methylglyoxal (in low amounts) can also have a positive effect on hosts lifespan52. GABA, apart from being a bacterial product, is protective for the hosts neurons54. Lastly, D-mannitol is a commonly-used sugar alcohol22, therefore its usage as a nutritional compound would make its usage as a supplement a safe option for the host..

Independently of the added supplement or the mono- or co-culturing, MYb11 and MYb71 showed increased growth in mono- and co-cultures when supplemented with 10 mM L-serine, L-threonine, GABA, as well as D-mannitol after 24 h (Figure 3A). Additionally, to quantify bacterial growth we used fluorescently-labeled strains. CFU of mono- and co-culture were plated and counted after 24 h growth in liquid culture in the presence (10 mM) or absence (0 mM) of the four compounds L-serine (Figure 3B), L-threonine (Figure 3C), GABA (Figure 3D) and D-mannitol (Figure 3E). MYb11 and MYb71 showed increased colony numbers in mono-culture when supplemented with L-serine and L-threonine compared to no supplementation (Figure 3B, C, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p  0.001, p 0.006, p 0.007, p 0.032, respectively). GABA supplementation led to an increase in growth of MYb11 in mono-culture, but not MYb71 (Figure 3D, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p 0.001, p 0.922, respectively), while D-mannitol had no effect on the growth of MYb11 nor MYb71 in mono-culture (Figure 3E, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p  0.259, p 0.661, respectively). However, all four compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, GABA and D-mannitol specifically promoted MYb11 growth in co-culture over MYb71 in vitro and thus confirmed the computational predictions (Figure 3C-E, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p  6.87e-06, p 0.001, p 7.15e-06, p 7.07e-06, respectively).

Concentration-dependent effect of L-serine supplementation in vitro The statistical analyses suggested that L-serine is the most promising precision prebiotic for further analysis among the compounds validated in vitro. We repeated the in vitro supplementation experiment across a concentration gradient to determine the optimal dose for enrichment of MYb11. Overall, the MYb11 growth as well as MYb71 growth in monoculture at 10 mM and 100 mM over time were increased following the increase in L-serine concentrations (Figure 4A). When quantifying the growth with supplementation at the same concentration gradient (Figure 4B), then starting with 1 mM did not significantly impact the abundance of MYb11 proportions (GLM, p 0.778), nor MYb71 (GLM, p 0.69). However, supplementation with 10 mM led to an enrichment of MYb11 (GLM, p 0.001), thereby indicating a significant difference in proportions in co-culture between MYb11 and MYb71 (GLM , p 5.77E-07). Essentially identical results were obtained at 100 mM, including an MYb11 enrichment (GLM, p 0.004), and a significant difference between MYb11 and MYb71 proportions (GLM, p 7.93 E-05)..

Serine supplementation alters bacterial colonization of C. elegans Finally, we tested whether L-serine supplementation to solid growth medium would alter bacterial proportions in the host C. elegans.

After 72 h, adult worms were collected to quantify bacterial proportions. Supplementation at 10 mM L-serine did not change the proportion of MYb11 in co-culture in worms compared to non-supplemented media (GLM, p 0.459, Figure 5A left panel). However, L-serine supplementation at 100 mM increased the proportion of MYb11 in the bacterial community in worms compared to non-supplemented media (GLM, p 0.001,Figure 5A right panel). We next asked whether the effect of supplementation on bacterial proportions in the host simply reflected changes in the proportion of bacteria that were available to them on the lawn (i.e., their diet). The relative abundance of MYb11 on lawns did not change by 10 mM supplementation (GLM, p 0.61, Figure 5A, left panel) compared to non-supplementation. However, the relative abundance of MYb11 was approximately 60 in non-supplemented media and increased to approximately 75 with 100 mM L-serine supplementation (GLM, p 0.002, Figure 5B, right panel). The observed proportions of MYb11 in worms at 100 mM serine were significantly higher than expected based on proportions in the lawn and thus colonization probability compared to MYb71 (Chi-squared test, 2  10.244, df  1, p 0.0013; see Methods). This suggests that the provision of serine enriches MYb11 in the host independently from the enrichment observed on the lawn and that serine allows MYb11 to overcome its growth-disadvantages in competition with MYb71 in the host..

We propose that the most effective way to modulate the composition of the microbiome is by modulating or enriching the abundance of an already existing bacterial species with health-beneficial effects using precision prebiotics. A direct approach to identify such precision prebiotics would be to provide compounds that are uniquely taken up by the bacterial target species. However, through an analysis of C. elegans and human microbiome data, we were able to show that such unique uptake compounds typically only exist for few species in a microbial community and especially for larger communities there are no such compounds at all. Thus, in a typical microbiome, precision prebiotics have to be identified from compounds that are potentially taken up by several species. To identify such compounds, we used genome-scale metabolic networks of two bacterial members from the C. elegans microbiome, Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, and the host-protective Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, in conjunction with constraint-based modeling to identify compounds that specifically increased the growth of MYb11. Using HMDB annotation45, we found that amino acids and fatty acids were enriched as predicted growth-supporting compounds for MYb11 which is in agreement with previous observations of the preference of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas for these compounds5861. Considering compounds that were identified across all three simulation approaches and cross-referencing with Biolog data revealed that 4-hydroxybenzoate, D-mannitol, -aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycerol-3-phosphate, L-serine, trehalose, L-threonine, and putrescine are potential precision prebiotics for MYb11. We experimentally tested four of these predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and GABA in vitro and confirmed their positive effect specifically on the growth of MYb11. Moving into the C. elegans host system, we were able to show that L-serine is also able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 in vivo, when the host was colonized with both bacterial species. Interestingly, while 10 mM of L-serine were sufficient for an enrichment of MYb11 in batch culture, 100 mM were necessary in the growth experiments with the host. This suggests differences in either bacterial uptake kinetics for L-serine or bacterial growth in. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Moreover, while MYb11 was strongly enriched in worms to similar levels like MYb71 even though it had a very low abundance in the lawn, this enrichment was even stronger when supplying L-serine. Thus, our proof-of-principle work demonstrates that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches are an effective tool for the future development of targeted microbiome therapies using precision prebiotics. The effect of serine and threonine on the host andor on its microbiome has been also documented in the literature. For instance, threonine is an essential amino acid for the host55. Longevity effects on the host have been shown also after supplementation with threonine62and serine53, while dietary serine reduced host fitness through acting on bacterial metabolism, when it was supplemented along with the chemotherapeutic 5-fluoro 2deoxyuridine56. Moreover, serine promotes the growth of E. coli LF82 in the mouse gut63, which shows the potential of this compound to alter the abundance of multiple species. In accordance, we also observed effects of serine on MYb71 growth, which was, however, stronger for MYb11 if they were grown in community. One important challenge to specifically target the microbiome with nutritional supplements is to prevent host uptake or metabolization of the supplements64. Different approaches to achieve restricted bioavailability, such as the supplementation of non-digestible carbohydrates65or coating of supplements with compounds that dissolve during passage through the digestive tract have been developed6668. Moreover, as indicated by our analysis of concentration-dependent effects of supplementation in the case of serine, it might be necessary to control the specific concentrations of a compound that are being released and their stability over time in the gut. To maintain relatively constant concentrations or to deviate from physiological constraints, advanced formulations (such as nanotechnology69, delayed release and other drug delivery technologies70,71) could be employed. Although our combined computational-experimental approach can serve as a blueprint for future studies aimed at the identification of precision prebiotics, several factors should still be taken into consideration. As we showed, it is nearly impossible to identify a compound that is uniquely taken. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

This point becomes apparent, if we consider the numerous different species that reside in various hosts. For instance, the synthetic bacterial community of C. elegans, CeMbio22has 12 members, while the human-related bacterial community AGORA has more than 800 species34. Thus, an important next step is to scale up our approach to more complex communities. Furthermore, since the physiology of worms cannot be directly compared to the physiology of humans, the efficacy and effectiveness of the approach (see more on the topic72) need to be studied in more detail. At this point, the complexity of the regulatory affairs in various jurisdictions (e.g., the definition of nutritional supplementation vs. medication, safety concerns) should also not be underestimated73. Taking everything into consideration, we showed that the design of targeted supplementation strategies to modulate the microbiome is not only feasible but also promising in terms of future microbiome-based treatment..

(B, C ,D, E)Colony-forming units (CFUl) in mono-cultures of MYb11 (left) and MYb71(right) or in co-culture (middle) after 5 h of 10 mM of the respective supplement. Shown are boxplots with the median as a thick horizontal line, the interquartile range as box, the whiskers as vertical lines, and each replicate depicted by a dot. Every replicate was normalized by subtracting the non-supplemented median (dashed line) of the respective bacteria. Statistical differences were determined by Wilcoxon signed rank test and are indicated by asterisks ( p 0.001,  p 0.005,  p 0.05). Black asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented and non-supplemented median, gray asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented medians of MYb11 and MYb71. n  5-14. Figure S2. No difference in relative growth rates of differentially labeled bacterial strains. Colony forming units of co-cultures of either MYb11::dTomatoMYb71::sfGFP or MYb11::GFPMYb71::dTomato were quantified after 24 h of growth in liquid NGM. There was no difference between the two fluorescent labeling systems at any concentration of L-serine (GLM, p 0.528 for main effect of fluorescence; and p 0.379 for interaction between fluorescence and concentration). .

        "introduction": "While traditionally considered commensals, it is becoming increasingly clear that the microbial communities living within and on higher host organisms (i.e., the microbiome) are integral parts of host physiology. These microbial communities fulfill essential roles in pathogen protection1, immune system education2, production of vitamins3, metabolism of xenobiotics4,5and increase the plasticity of their hosts to respond to evolutionary challenges6,7. Thus, the composition of the microbiota plays an important role in the well-being of hosts and its ability to respond to environmental challenges8,9, as indicated by the frequent shift of microbiota composition observed in the context of diseases10and exposure to environmental stressors11. These observations and work in animal models have led to the development of the notion that the composition of the microbiome itself might be an important modulator of host health12as well as fitness and that a targeted modulation of microbiome composition might offer a completely new avenue for modulating the host. It has been shown that dietary patterns (e.g., western diet) can affect the structure of the microbiome, however their effect is transient13. Besides an influence of dietary uptake on microbiome composition, various approaches to modify the microbial communities of organisms have been used14: the transfer of entire microbial communities from a donor to a recipient host (fecal transfer), the provision of compounds used by particular microbial species (prebiotics), the provision of microbial strains of natural or synthetic origin (probiotics), the provision of compounds of microbial origin (postbiotics) and combinations thereof (synbiotics). While fecal transfer is the most commonly used approach to modulate microbial community composition in animal models, it involves the transfer of entire microbial communities and therefore not only desirable traits. In consequence, there is only a single medical indication in which fecal transfers are routinely used thus far15and there are potential concerns about the safety and stability of the engraftment of transplants16. Although the concept of supplementation with pre-, pro- or synbiotics has been commonly proposed as a method of microbial manipulation, these approaches are still severely limited. In.

Another important aspect to consider is the specificity with which individual target microorganisms can be manipulated using prebiotics. Thus, while oligosaccharides are considered beneficial there is often uncertainty about which species can degrade them, as multiple, unrelated species can degrade similar types of oligosaccharides (e.g., Bacteroidetes, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacterium species can degrade fructans)17,18. In case of supplementation with probiotics and synbiotics, other concerns have been raised. For instance, the ability of specific Bifidobacteria to stably colonize the human gut was only reported for  of the participants in a clinical trial19. Moreover, introducing exogenous bacteria can have unwanted side effects. For example, some of theBacillus species which were used as probiotics in aquacultures were found to carry virulence and antibiotic resistance genes20. Hence, to overcome these limitations in current microbiome manipulation approaches, we need to focus on prebiotics with well-controlled modes of action (e.g., microbial pathways of prebiotics degradation) that preferentially modulate the abundance of resident microbial species. Since mechanisms of pathogenicity are often complex and context specific21, it is preferred if these species are native to the microbiome of the host, as unwanted side-effects due to the introduction of foreign bacterial species might be avoided. Within this work, we will refer to prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of selected bacterial strains within the microbiome of a specific host as precision prebiotics. To design and evaluate such precision prebiotics, it is essential to start with a tractable model system such as the well-established model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The native microbial community of the invertebrate C. elegans was first described in 201622, yet the nematode has already been used for over twenty years as a model for studying host-microbial interactions23. To similarly promote C. elegans-microbiome research, a synthetic 12-member C. elegans-specific microbiome resource, CeMbio, was recently established22. Part of this consortium is the Gram-negative Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 that is known to possess antifungal24and. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Besides its protective effects, MYb11 is known to colonize and persist in the C. elegans intestine22and thus increase the nematodes fitness during infection25.Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 is another member of the CeMbio community22and affects different host life-history traits 22,26, persistently colonizes the nematode24, and has been described as competitive against other bacteria in terms of space and nutrients27. Both bacteria are also able to interact metabolically with the nutrient environment determining their type of interaction27. Hence, a microbial community consisting of one beneficial bacterium and another one that is competitive offers an excellent opportunity for developing targeted approaches for microbiome manipulation. A key prerequisite for the development of precision prebiotics is a detailed understanding of the metabolic functions present within a microbial community and how specific metabolic interventions affect microbiome metabolism. One important approach to investigate metabolic functions in microbial communities are constraint-based metabolic modeling approaches2830. Based on the genetic information either on the level of each bacterium or from the overall community and biochemical databases, these methods allow one to simulate the network of chemical reactions that represent the metabolic reactions of the microorganism(s) or the community31. To this end, genome-scale metabolic models of the bacterial species within a microbiome have to be reconstructed from genomic data. These models summarize the metabolic functions present within an organism and can be reconstructed using automated reconstruction approaches32,33or obtained from existing model repositories34. Furthermore, accounting for the growth environment of a species35, optimization approaches such as flux balance analysis (FBA) for individual species 28or constraint-based community modeling approaches36,37can be used to predict metabolic activities within individual species as well as interactions between species. These methods have already been used to identify metabolic alterations in the microbiome of Parkinsons disease patients38as well as patients with inflammatory bowels disease39,27and to study the interaction of C. elegans as well as its microbiota in the context of drug-microbiome-host interactions30. For C. elegans, metabolic models of the CeMbio community including MYb11 and MYb7122and other members of the microbiota are available27.. CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

We tested four of the predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vitro and confirmed that they selectively boost the abundance of MYb11. Moving to the C. elegans host system, we moreover showed that L-serine is able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 when the C. elegans host was colonized with both bacterial species. Thus, we demonstrate that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches could represent a key tool for the design of targeted microbiome intervention approaches. 4.Material and",
