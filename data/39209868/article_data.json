Brereton24 The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of space ight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy.Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiotainteractions during space ight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of space ight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed signi cant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris andDysosmobacter welbionis . Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply thatinteractions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to space ight pathology and that these interactions might critically in uence human health and long-duration space ight feasibility. The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth s space agencies, has outlined a cle ar target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable thisambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of theimminent commercial low Earth orbit ( LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early2030 s 3. Major challenges associat ed to longer duration space ight and habitation off-Earth are identi ed in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions. Consistently observed space ight-associated pathologies, notably dis- rupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipidmetabolism dysregulation, pose signi cant risks to astronaut health 5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulatedmicrogravity model system develop ed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of -TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes 7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity ha s been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8.T h i si sr e ected in the muscle transcriptome after space ight, where insulin receptor signalling is sug- gestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9. Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10and mesenchymal stem11cell cultures increases production of fatty acids andcomplex lipids. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 re spond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown of sbp-1 and mdt-15 reducing lipid toxicity12. Space ight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))1315characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with space ight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and sub- stantial increases in cholesterol (67 ). Similar lipid dysregulation, sugges- tive of non-alcoholic fa tty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to space ight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis1620. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, signi cant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids. The immune system can be compromised by space ight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before ight, infection with inuenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50 of astronauts also exhibit immunode ciency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infect ion. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated withspace ight 26,a sw e l la ss h i f t si nt h eg u tm i c r o b i o m e27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological fu nction have been associated to gut A full list of af liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: nicholas.breretonucd.ie npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 11234567890():,; 1234567890():,;microbiota2832. Similarly, unique built envi ronment surface microbiology arises from long-duration con nement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse envi ronmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote op portunistic pathogenicity3337. Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in space ight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been incr easing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with space ight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38identi ed signi cant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in RodentResearch (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as withinthe genera Staphylococcus and Tyzzerella , and were lower in mice after space ight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al. 39 explored the gut microbiome of BALBc mice o w ni nt h eR R - 5m i s s i o n using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole meta- genome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identi ed 14 ASVs as dif- ferent in relative abundance ( p0.1) between space ight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of space ight, including increases in the genera Clostridium ,Romboutsia ,Ruminiclostridium ,a n d Shuttleworthia ,a n d decreases in Hungatella ,w h i l eW M Si d e n t i ed signi cant enrichment of Dorea sp. and the species Lactobacillus murinus . In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employe d to capture metagenomic changesin the murine gut microbiome associated with space ight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig. 1). Intestinal and hepatic tran- scriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression responseof mice to space ight. Results Space ight increased total body weight Four treatment groups from a single cohort of 32 weeks-old female mice included two space ight groups o w nt ot h eI S So nS p a c e X - 1 3 :F L T _ L A R , returned to Earth after 29 days of space ight as part of the Live Animal Return mission, and FLT_ISS, sampled on the ISS by the crew after 56 daysof space ight. Two control groups included GC_LAR and GC_ISS, reared in identical habitats at the Kennedy Space Centre and sampled after 29 and56 days of the mission, respectively. Although reduced muscle mass andbone density in astronauts and mice during space ight are commonly observed 40,41, in this study, total mouse body weight was trending to increase after 29 days of space ight in Live Animal Return mice (FLT_LAR; n9 ) and signi cantly increased after 56 days of space ight in ISS mice (FLT_ISS; n7 ,p0.05). Carcass mass did not differ signi cantly ( t-test, p0 . 0 5 ) between Ground Control Live Animal Return (GC_LAR; n7 ) a n d FLT_LAR mice, which weighed 28.9 g1(1.6) and 30.1 g1(1.4), respectively, but did signi cantly ( t-test, p0.05) increase from 28.4 g1 (1.4) in Ground Control ISS (GC_ISS; n 9) mice to 32.9 g1(1.0) in 02 9 5 6 Day  B Fig. 1  Experimental design.

Suzuki et al.42observed similar increases in the mouse habitat unit 3 mission and attributed these changes tosubstantial increases in both whit e and brown adipose tissue, and large increases in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. While healthy adipose cells play an important role i n maintaining insulin sensitivity, dysregulated adipose can lead to production of pro-in ammatory and insulin-antagonistic molecules 43,44. Space ight alters murine gut microbiota Insulin resistance and lipid a ccumulation are common space ight phenotypes45which are in uenced by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and can be improved through butyrate dietary interventions inground-based murine studies 46,47. As butyrate and other SCFAs are predominantly produced by bacteria within the gut48, alterations in RR6 gut microbiome composition wer e explored. Characterisation of microbiota used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as WMS sequencing from faecal samples collected from GC_LAR andFLT_LAR (after 29 days of space i g h t )a sw e l la sG C _ I S Sa n dF L T _ I S S mice (after 56 days of space ight). Sequencing of amplicon libraries generated 2,146,311 sequences after quality control, with an average of 77,015  853 per sample (Fig. 2AE; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). A total of 133 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were inferred across all samples; these ESVs accounted for 1,959,722(91.32) of reads. Thirty- ve ESVs were annotated as putative bacterial species, 12 at genera level and 11 at family level, with an average of  99.9nucleotide identity, while 74 ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised taxa (99 nucleotide identity; 14 of which were agged as putative chimeras). Most counts (73.1) were captured by ESVs annotated asputative species, 24 of these could be assigned to a single species and 11 tomultiple species which share identi cal rRNA gene sequences at the V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Bacterial species putatively identi ed across all mice using amplicons belonged to the phyla Firmicutes (28), Proteo-bacteria (4), Actinobacteria (1), Defe rribacteres (1) and Bacteroidetes (1). Parabacteroides goldsteinii had the highest relative abundance throughout the samples and accounted for 53.7 of sequence counts. WMS of faecal DNA generated 277,294,078 reads after quality control, with an average of 8,665,440  1,423,541 per sample (Fig. 2FI; Supplementary Fig. 4 and Data 2). Co-assembly across all 32 mice generated 219,259 contigs and back-mapping captured 85.1 of rawcounts after ltering out reads using the mouse genome (154,692,460 counts). This included 22,318 contigs which could be provisionallyannotated (90 nucleotide identity) from 175 species and shared anaverage of 99.1 average nucleotide identity (ANI) with known speciesor strains (and capturing 84.5 of total counts) (Fig. 2G, H). After sparsity (90 counts in a single sample) and minimum sample (3)occurrence ltering to allow statistical detection of space ight associated differences across biological replicates, 45,890 contigs remained whichcaptured 154,238,826 counts. These contigs were provisionally anno- tated as putative bacteria (50.6), viruses (0.9) and metazoa (3.0), or were unknown (45.4). Grouping WMS contigs by species annotationandltering for high con dence (97 ANI, and  3000 nt total length) identi ed 97 putative species representing 81 bacterial species within Firmicutes, and 7 Proteobacteria, 4 Actinobacteria, 1 Bacteroidetes, and1 Deferribacteres, as well as the helminths, Trichinella nativa andTri- chinella pseudospiralis (Supplementary Data 3). These species groups ranged from 2 2734 contigs, with an average total alignment length of  880,000 nt and an ANI of 98.8. Prevalent taxa included P. gold- stienii representing 73.1, Enterocloster clostridioformis representing 1.47 and all other species representing below 1 of relative abundanceacross all mice, including non-bacterial species such as T. nativa , representing 0.03 of relative abundance and present in all mice. P. goldsteinii is a ubiquitous commensal gut microbiome inhabitant in mice, and the species includes strains that play a role in reducingintestinal in ammation and maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity 49,50.Microbial alpha diversit y indices did not signi cantly differ between mice groups using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing or WMS data (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). Canonical Analysis of PrincipalCoordinates showed both FLT_ISS and GC_ISS as well as FLT_LAR and GC_LAR samples segregated by group, and the rst axes explained 25.46 and 17.63 of variation using 16 S rRNA gene ampli cation and 19.41 and 11.49 of variation using WMS, respectively. ANOVA-like permuta-tion tests con rmed signi cant variation between groups under constraint f o rb o t ha m p l i c o na n dW M Sd a t a( F i g . 2E, I;p0.05; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3), suggesting space ight in uenced gut microbiota in both comparisons regardless of the metagenomic approach taken. Signi cant space ight microbiome changes are associated with short-chain fatty acid metabolism, bile acid conversion andpathogenicity Differential abundance analysis of amplicon data identi ed 45 ESVs that were signi cantly different in relative abundance between space ight and ground control mice, including 34 ESVs between GC_LAR and FLT_LARand 18 ESVs between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3A, B; av p-value  0.004, av padj  0.02, Supplementary Figs. 5 ,6 ,D a t a1 ) .A l t h o u g ht h e r ew e r e divergent changes in the relative abundance of H. xylanolytica , the common signicant enrichment of E. muris andD. welbionis in mice after 29 and 56 days of space ight, compared to separate matched control groups, sug- gests space ight had some common in uence of gut microbiota which persisted over the 29 56 days onboard the ISS as wel l as some distinct effects over time. Differential abundance analysis of WMS identi ed 13,996 contigs that were signi cantly different (DESeq2 FDR 0.1) in relative abun- dance between space ight and ground control mice, including 11,087 between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 3,997 between GC_ISS andFLT_ISS (Fig. 3CH). From these, 35 putative species (99.0 ANI; Supplementary Note, Data 3) identi ed as signi cantly differentially abundant between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (Fig. 3I) with an average total length of 390,616nt per species, while 34 species (99.0 ANI)signicantly differed between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3J) with an average total length of 180,554 nt. D. welbionis was recently characterised by Roy et al. 51,52as a butyrate p r o d u c e rl i k e l yp r e s e n ti nt h eg u to fm o s th u m a n sa n dw a sn e g a t i v e l y correlated with BMI in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. Thesame team used murine supplementat ion experiments to illustrate that D. welbionis could partially counteract insu lin resistance, adipose tissue hypertrophy and in ammation as well as suggest a potential association with mitochondrial content and activit y in adipose tissue after high fat diet induction of obesity 52. In mice, changes in microbially produced butyrate are also know to directly in uence expression of hepatic circadian clock reg- ulating genes, such as Per2 andBmal1 , in a bidirectional interaction which can disrupt host metabolism53.E n r i c h m e n to f D. welbionis in both groups of space ight mice (Fig. 3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground controls here is therefore noteworth y given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed inrodent research missions and astronauts 17,18,45. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracti ng or contributing towards space ight pathology is unclear and merits furth er study. Conversely, other butyrate producers, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens54, were depleted after 29 days of space ight. L. murinus andAcutalibacter muris were depleted in mice during space ight (Fig. 3A ,I ) ,a sw e l la ss o m e Enterocloster species after 29 days of space ight, which can have high expression of bile salt h y d r o l a s e s( B S H s ) ,a b l et od e c o n j u g a t eb i l es a l t si n t ol e s st o x i cb i l eacids, and can promote microbially mediated 7 -dehydroxylation of host primary bile acids into secondary bile acids 5559.C o n v e r s i o no f the major human primary bile acid s in humans, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholicacid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limitednumber of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid induciblehttps:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 3Fig. 2  Ground control, live animal return and ISS murine gut microbiome capture.

The major murine primary bile acids also include -a n d -muricholic acid ( MCA and MCA), which are transformed by 7 -dehydroxylation to mur- ideoxycholic acid (MDCA).E. muris , which signi cantly increased in both space ight groups of mice compared to ground controls (Fig. 3A, B, I, J), has been recently characterised as 7 -dehydroxylating in mice62, containing the bile acid inducible operons BaiBCDEFGI and BaiJKL, and BaiA, homologous toClostridium scindens . The Bai operon enables E. muris andC. scindens to https:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 5increase concentrations of 7 -dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the host bile acid pool and act as li gands to bile acid receptors to in uence host inammation, glucose and lipid metabolism6266. For example, bile sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) modulates e nterohepatic recirculation and host cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation of cyp7A166. Similarly, secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile acid receptor TGR5, which controls glucose homoeostasis in adipose tissueand muscle by altering intestinal cell release of the insulin secretion regulatorglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 6769. Liver production of -MCA and -MCA (in mice) is mediated by cyp2c70 genes70,71but 7  -dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such as E.muris can modify MCAs after epimerization into HDCA72, and critically regulate lipid metabolism73,74. Interestingly, E. clostridioformis ,s i g n i cantly higher in relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of space ight (Fig. 3), is reported as increasing in the presence of E. muris62and harbours 7  hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH)59,75, which can also transform primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids64. This agrees with ndings from the RR-5 mission39,w h i c hf o u n ds i g n i cantly increased levels of serum c h o l i n ei nm i c ea f t e rs p a c e ight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid metabolism. Immune suppression has previous ly been described as a response to space ght76and could result as bile acid dysregulation77,78. So increased relative abundance of C. dif cileafter both 29 and 56 days of space ight is of potential concern if toxigenic. Changes in space ight associated metagenome functional prediction Metagenomic functional prediction identi ed 4,583,759 genes in the co- assembly generated from all 32 mice, 392,631 of which were annotated byKegg database (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, a high proportion (91.4)of genes, including differentially abundant genes, remain unannotated.Kegg annotated genes included the pathogenicity locus (includingtcdAB )f r o m C. dif cile, suggesting signi cant enrichment of the species after 29 and 56 days (Fig. 3I, J) could include a toxigenic strain. Bile acid metabolism genes were identi ed, including 17 bile salt hydrolases, including that from space ight enriched A. muris (Cbh), and 57 non- redundant Bai genes, including from C. scindens (BaiABCDEFGI )a n d I. butyriciproducens (BaiA and BaiCD ), species which were signi cantly depleted after space ight as well as A. muris (BaiCD ),Eisenbergiella massiliensis (BaiA ) and Blautia pseudococcoides (BaiCD ), species which were signi cantly enriched after space ight (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). E. aldenensis andS. arabinosiphila both contained the impor- tantBaiCD gene and were signi cantly enriched in mice after 29 days of space ight but signi cantly depleted after 56 days. Alongside signi cantenrichment of the rare 7 -dehydroxylating E. muris , these shifts suggest dynamic changes in secondary bile acid production and potentialinuence on the composition of the host bile acid pool 56,79. Differential abundance analysi s inferred 52,370 genes were sig- nicantly different (FDR 0.1) in abundance after 29 days and 37,068 genes after 56 days of space ight, which could be assigned to 2,811 and 2,572 unique KEGG ontology terms, respectively (Fig. 4A). Over-representation analysis identi ed signi cant (FDR 0.1) increases in pathways of interest related to fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, antimicrobial resis-tance and potential host interactions (ECM, carbohydrates and patho-genicity), after both 29 days and 56 days of space ight compared to ground controls (Fig. 4B, C; Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these sig- nicant changes in metagenomic gene inventories, and speci cb a c t e r i a l species with well-characterised functions, due to space ight suggest gut microbiome changes which should in uence lipid and bile acid homo- eostasis, and the immune system of the murine host. Space ight alters host intestinal gene expression Faecal or serum fatty acid or bile acid concentrations were not measured within the Rodent Research 6 mission; however, host colon and liver geneexpression were assessed from all four groups of mice, allowing hostresponses to space ight at the host-gut microbiome interface to be investigated. Host intestinal gene expression revealed extensive signi cant (FDR 0.1) changes after 2 9 days and 56 days of space ight when compared to ground controls, including 4613 differentially expressed (DE) genesbetween GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 4,476 DE genes between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 5AH; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and Data 5). Of these, 43 and 44 were increased due to ight in LAR and ISS mice, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at apathway level after 29 days and 56 days of space ight (Fig. 5I, J), including immune suppression, dysregulation off cholesterol and bile acid, andextracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Intestinal bile acid and circadian rhythm gene expression Signi cant microbiome alteration in some of the few well- characterised 7 -dehydroxylating bacterial species, including increa- ses in E. muris a f t e r2 9d a y sa n d5 6d a y so fs p a c e ight (below detection in ground controls) as well as depletion of C. scindens , suggests sec- ondary bile acid production and the bile acid pool is likely altered in the murine gut during space ight. In the host intestine, bile acids are passively absorbed or actively take n up through the apical membrane by the apical sodium-dependen t bile acid transporter, ASBT ( Slc10A2 ), bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP ( Fabp6 ),Fig. 3  Space ight-associated signi cant microbiome alterations.

Increases in intestinal bile acid also activate thefarnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR )h e t - erodimer which regulates production and secretion of broblast growth factor FGF1519 , the negative feedback hormone which travels through portal circulation to bi nd hepatic FGFR4 receptors which suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition of Cyp7A182.https:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 7After 29 days of space ight, Abcc2 was signi cantly downregulated, suggesting reduced BA export to the colon, while Asbt,Ibabp, Ost ,Ostand Ugt1a1 were all signi cantly upregulated as well as Rxr(not Fxr),Fgf1519 andFgfr4 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Figs. 9 14 and Data 5). Taken together, these changes suggest space ight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism in the intestine which would lead to bile acid suppression of hepatic Cyp7A1 and accumulation of cholestero l or hypercholesterolaemia83. Interestingly, intestinal Cyp7A1 expression was identi ed as signi cantly repressed after 29 days of space ight. Previous proteomic research in Biom-1M mice suggested a decrease in bile secretion during space ight84while hepatic metabolite assessment of mice after space ight in the Space Shuttle Atlantis measured increased accumulation of cholate and taurodeoxycholate16.A s the major cholesterol degradati on mechanism in humans and mice is conversion to bile acids, cholesterol a ccumulation, alongside bile acid dys- regulation and suppression of Cyp71A , should increase direct intestinal cholesterol excretion85. Supporting this extrapolation, both cholesterol excretion transporter genes, Abcg5 andAbcg8 ,w e r es i g n i cantly upregu- lated in the intestine after 29 days of space ight. After 56 days, intestinal Cyp7A1 was still signi cantly repressed and both Abcg5 andAbcg8 upregulated, but GSEA indicated a further shift in intestinal bile acid metabolism (Fig. 5I, J; Supplementary Figs. 9 14). This was underlined by signi cant downregulation of the apical bile acid trans- porter Asbt compared to ground controls as well as Ntcp (Slc10a1 )86,i n d i - cating a switch to active reduction in bile acid uptake. Coinciding with thiswas signi cant increases in expression of Lxr, the liver x receptor gene expressed widely in different tissues, which can help prevent bile acidtoxicity through induction of Abcg 5 and Abcg8 mediated cholesterol excretion 8790. In gene expression analysis of multiple tissues in mice after space- ight, da Silveira et al.18found that enrichment within the circadian rhythm pathway of the kidney, liver, eye, adrenal gland and variousmuscle tissues. Within the intestine here, the major clock genes, the cir- cadian locomotor output cycles kaput ( Clock ) and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 ( Bmal1 ;Arntl ) transcription factors, were sig- nicantly upregulated after 29 days and 56 days of space ight, and the neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 ( Npas2 ) was upregulated after 56 days (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Figs. 9 14 and Data 5). These regulate the major clock-controlled genes reverse-erythroblastosis (Rev-Erb and ) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors, including gamma(Rorc) 91, as well as Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3 ),Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein ( Dec1 and Dec2 ) genes92,93, all of which were signi cantly downregulated after 56 days of space ight except for Rev-Erb (Nr1d1 ) (only downregulated after 29 days). These genes can feedback to inhibit ClockNpas2 andBmal1 as part of a feedback loop94,95, and also regulate other the clock controlled genes such as DBP, HLF and TEF , signi cantly downregulated, and Nl3 (E4BP4) , signi cantly upregulated after 56 days of space ight. These space ight-associated changes in core clock genes, such as upregulation of Bmal1 ,Arntl andNpas2 , largely agree with those found in murine muscletissue after longer-term space ight which were characterised as similar to age-related gene expression on earth96. These clock genes regulate nutrient absorption, gut motility, intestinal barrier function and immunity92and have also been shown to require and interact with the microbiome, includin g in response to microbially-derived molecules, such as butyrate and bile acids, and in direct response tomicrobial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) 53,92,9799. In addition to the widespread intestinal gene expression responses to bile acids, the majorbutyrate receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 ( Ffar2 ;Gpr43 ) 100was signi cantly upregulated after 56 days of space ight. Similarly, the archetypal intestinal MAMP recognising mannose-binding lectin genes, Mbl-1 and Mbl-2101, were signi cantly downregulated. Furthermore, Wang et al.102reported host immune responses to microbial agellin and lipopolysaccharide in the intestine increased expression of Il-23, and Il-22, leading to a down-regulation of Rev-Erb and subsequent upregulation of Nl3,w h i c hi nt u r n can regulate clock-associated nutrie nt absorption and immunity. Here, mice followed this speci c expression pattern after space ight (Supplementary Data 5), implying the space ight associated microbiome alterations could have been recognised and in uenced these changes in clock gene expression. Intestinal extracellular matrix remodelling and immune com- promise during space ight Changes in the extracellular matrix-receptor interactions pathway were underpinned by signi cant upregulation of collagens ( Col1a1 -2,Col3a1 , Col4a1 -2,Col5a1 -2,Col5a3 ,Col6a2 -3,Col12a1 ,Col26a1 ), laminins (Lama3) , thrombospondin ( Thbs1 ) and tenascins ( Tnc)i nm i c ea f t e r 29 days of space ight, which became more pronounced after 56 days of space ight (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Data 5). This coincided with upregu- lation of integrin ( Itga5 andItga7 ) and matrix glycoprotein ( Sdc4 andGp5) receptors, collectively implying extensi ve extracellular matrix remodelling during space ight. The ECM and mucosal collagen scaffold in particular are known to be shaped by microbiota103, as are mucins, which make up the intestinal mucus layer and have a dynamic relationship with commensal bacteria as well as serving as a critical barrier against colonisation bypathogenic bacteria 104.S i g n i cant increase in the secretory mucin gene Muc2 and signi cant decreases in the membrane bound Muc3 and mucosal pentraxin 1 (Mptx1), three of the most ly highly abundant transcripts in the murine intestine here, were observed after 56 days of space ight, suggesting alterations to mucin within the intestinal lumen in direct contact withmicrobiota. Mucin 2 ( Muc2 ) is well characterised as regulated by intestinal bacteria, with O-glycans serving as nutrients and adhesion sites formicrobiota 105, but are also differentially expressed in response to pathogens104, including Trichinella106,i d e n t i ed here. Extensive changes to mucosa were indicated by widespread downregulation of cell adhesion molecules during space ight, including downregulation of CD8a andCD8b1 genes, genes encoding costimulatory molecules CD2,6,80,86,40and ICOSL within intestinal antigen presenting cells as well as their T cell activating bindingpartners CD48 ,166,28andICOS 107 109(Fig. 5G; Supplementary Data 5).Fig. 4  Metagenomic functional prediction.

Changes in fatty acid pathways included Fatty acid biosynthesis (00061), Fatty acid metabolism (01212), Fatty acid degradation (00071) and Butanoate metabolism (00650), including butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.8) and butyrate kinase(EC:2.7.2.7). Over-representation of bile acid metabolism was re ected in Bile secretion (04976) and Cholesterol metabolism (04979) and Secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways, including bile salt hydrolase ( cbh, EC:3.5.1.24) and 3- oxocholoyl-CoA 4-desaturase ( baiCD , EC:1.3.1.115). Over-representation of the antimicrobial resistance was represented in Brite ontology Antimicrobial resistance genes (ko01504) and the pathways for beta-Lactam resistance (01501), Biosynthesis of various antibiotics (00998) and Biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics(01055). The Brite ontology Bacterial toxins (ko02042) was over-represented, including tight junction interacting zona occludens toxin (K10954), as well as the pathways Pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (05130) and Bacterial invasion ofepithelial cells (05100). Diverse carbohydrate metabolism and ECM interactingpathways were represented by Galactose metabolism (00052), Mannose type O-glycan biosynthesis (00515), Glycosaminoglycan degradation (00531), Other glycan degradation (00511), ECM-receptor interaction (04512) as well as the Briteontology of Glycosaminoglycan binding proteins (ko00536), Peptidoglycan bio- synthesis and degradation proteins (ko01011) and Glycosyltransferases (ko01003). These included putative Mucin-associated glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) 185, GH2s: -galactosidase (EC:3.2.1.23), -mannosidase (EC:3.2.1.25), -glucuronidase (EC:3.2.1.31), -l-arabinofuranosidase (EC:3.2.1.55), -xylosidase (EC:3.2.1.37), -glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.21), GH20: -hexosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52), GH29: -l- fucosidase (EC:3.2.1.51), and GH84: N-acetyl -glucosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52).https:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 8Cytokine genes, such as the chemokine Ccl22 and receptor Ccr4 involved in the intestinal immune response to enteric bacterialpathogens in murine mucosa 110, were also uniformly downregulated (Fig. 5F), alongside others111 113:Ccl3,5,6and22, Ccr4 ,7a n d9 ,C x c r 2 , 3 and 6 ,Il-5,7,12and16,a n d Il-2r,5r,7r,10r,12r,18r,21r,23rand27r.A nexception to this pattern of cytokine downregulation was upregulation IL-23 and IL-22, which interact with circadian regulation95, and spe- cic members of the mucosal homoeostasis critical interleukin 17 family114,Il-17d , which promotes pathogenicity during infection through suppression of CD8 Tc e l l s115,a n d Il-17rc , which increases https:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 9expression during compromised epithelial barrier integrity (wounding)116. These expression pro les, alongside consistent downregulation of genes within the Intestinal IgA pathway (Fig. 5H), suggest suppression of immunity and widespread tissue remodelling at the host-gut microbiomeinterface in mice after space ight. This agrees with reports of reduced cytokine production in mice after simulated microgravity 117,i m m u n ed y s - function in splenic tissue of mice after 13 days of space ight on the Space Shuttle Atlantis118and in astronauts, alongside increases in plasma cortisol concentration which reached Cushing syndrome levels, during space ight119. Taken together, this provides an insight into the role the host- gut-microbiome interface might pl ay in the current broad consensus of immune dysregulation in space ight environments120. Space ight alters gene expression in the liver Hepatic gene differential expression a nalysis comparing mice after 29 days and 56 days in space to their relative ground controls identi ed 4029 DE genes and 4068 DE genes, respectively (FDR 0.1; Fig. 6A, H; Supplemen- tary Figs. 15, 16 and Data 5). Of these, 48 and 49 were increased due to29 days and 56 days of space ight, respectively. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of space ight (Fig. 6I, J), including disruption of bile acid and energy metabolism. Bile acid disruption underlies hepatic cholesterol accumulation The most abundant intestinal transcripts in mice after 56 days of space ight, differentially expressed and repres enting 8 and 9 of normalised counts, were from the non-coding RNA Rn7s1 andRn7s2 genes (7 S RNA 1 and 2; Supplementary Data 5), respectively, which were recently characterised asinhibitors of global mitochon drial transcription in mammals 121.T h i si s consistent with the mitochondrial dysfunction highlighted as characteristicof space ight pathogenicity in recent multiomic analysis performed by de Silveira et al. 18, who also characterised compromised liver function in mice and astronauts after space ight compared ground controls, including upregulation of Fgf21 , a negative repressor of bile synthesis122, and accu- mulation of total cholesterol (higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol butdecreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Here, another potentrepressor of Cyp7A1 bile synthesis, broblast growth factor 1 ( fgf1) 123,w a s upregulated in the liver of mice after 29 days of space ight, and the more well known Fgf2116was signi cantly upregulated in the liver after both 29 days and 56 days of space ight. Within the liver, Sterol 14-demeth ylase (Cyp51) catalyses the trans- formation of lanosterol into cholesterol and Cyp7A1 is then the rst (and rate-limiting) enzymatic step in tra nsformation of cholesterol in primary bile acid biosynthesis, which itself is strictly inhibited by bile acid concentrations124. The production of bile salts is then a stepwise transfor- mation process dependent on gene expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase type 7 ( Hsd3b7 ) gene, cholic acid-speci cCyp8b1 gene and acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 2 ( Acox2 ) before conjugation by Baat,Acnat1 andAcnat2 , and subsequent excretion in the bile duct by bile salt exporter pump (BSEP) 125,126.Cyp51 ,Cyp8b1 andAcox2 genes were signi cantly upregulated andCyp7a1 andFxr(Nr1h4 )w e r es i g n i cantly downregulated in the liver of m i c ea f t e r5 6d a y so nt h eI S S( F i g . 6C; Supplementary Figs. 17 21 and Data 5). The cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5 andAbcg8 (intestinally upre- g u l a t e da f t e r2 9a n d5 6d a y so fs p a c e ight) were upregulated in the liver after 29 days, but no longer signi cantly upregulated after 56 days, and Abcg8 was signicantly downregulated. This reducti on is surprising given the uniform accumulation of cholesterol observed after extended space ight; in contrast, Bsep and the bile acid conjugating acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase 1 and 2 ( Acnat1 andAcnat2; Baatp12 ) genes were sig- nicantly upregulated. Taken tog ether, these expression pro les suggest hepatic accumulation of cholesterol, characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolic dysruption97, and describe a subsequent increase in the produc- tion bile acids in the liver, preferentially cholic acid, their subsequent con-jugation and export as bile salts, with the seemingly contradictory reductionin Cyp7A1 consistent with feedback inhibition. The other major mechanism for detoxi cation during cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver is sulfonation of bile acids, the transfer of asulfonate group to a hydroxyl (OH) by a subfamily of cytosolic sulfo-transferases ( Sult2a genes) which increases their solubility, decreases enterohepatic recirculation, and increase excretion 127.A f t e r2 9 d a y so f space ight, hepatic Sult2a1 ,Sult2a4 and Sult2a5 were downregulated, which shifted to downregulation of Sult2a7 and Sult2a8 after 56 days (Supplementary Data 5). In humans, bi le acid sulfonation is catalysed by Sult2a1, which sulfonates the 3-OH of bile acids. In contrast, mice have 8 Sult2a genes, with Sult2a1-6 sharing close homology to Sult2a1 butSult2a8 being recently characterised as havi ng major function in sulfonating 7 -OH of bile acids128,129, of particular relevance here due to space ight microbiome changes in 7 -dehydroxylating E. muris andC. scindens . Notably, during acute phase immune responses, alterations to fatty acid, cholesterol, and bileacid metabolism, Sult2a1 is known to be suppressed by cholesterol and bile acid regulating nuclear Fxr(Nr1h4 )a n d Car(Nr1i3 ) nuclear receptors 130,t h e latter of which also regulates bile acid responsive transporter gene Mdr1 (ABCB1)131, all three of which were downre gulated after 56 days of space- ight (Fig. 6C) and provide further evidence of bile acid dysregulation and toxic stress consistent with extensive disruption of the gut-liver axis132. Hepatic energy homoeostasis disruption after space ight Beheshti et al.17observed signi cant depletion in Cyp7A1 protein levels in mice after space ight (RR1 and RR3), alongside disruption in glucose and lipid metabolism133as well as NAFLD134. Here, pathways related to energy homoeostasis consistently alter ed in gene expression due to space ight after 29 and 56 days included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin sig- nalling and insulin resistance (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Figs. 17 21 and Data 5). The highest relative abundance (CPM) of transcripts signi cantly increased in the liver of mice after 56 days of space ight included fatty acid synthase ( Fasn), the liver fat accumulation-associated carbonic anhydrase 3 (Car3)135, and the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid desaturation, Stearoyl-Fig. 5  Microbiome-host interface: space ight alters colon gene expression.

Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with dif-ferentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 9 14. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level between 29 days and 56 days of space ight. This included widespread down- regulation of the components of the intestinal immune system after space ight, including intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen processing and presentation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, PARR signalling metabolism of xenobiotics, Staphylococcus aureus infection, T cell receptor signalling, natural killercell mediated cytotoxicity, graft-vs-host disease and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions pathways, as well as downregulation of cholesterol pathways, including cholesterol metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Space ight also led to common upregulation of pathways associated to intestinal extracellular matrix(ECM) remodelling, including ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction pathways, and cortisol production represented through the Cushing syndrome pathway. The bile secretion pathway was signi cantly upregu- lated after 29 days of space ight, but downregulated after 56 days, suggesting bile acid dynamics should be explored at the gene level. Similarly, mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, pathways in cancer and insulin resistance were only upregulated at thepathway level after 29 days of space ight, while bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, NAFLD, butonoate metabolism, insulin secretion and insulin signalling pathways were upregulated and the circadian rhythm pathway was downregulated after only 56 days of space ight.https:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 10CoA desaturase (SCD), recently identi ed as a key role at the crossroads of immune response and lipid metabolism through interplay with PPAR 136, also signi cantly upregulated here (Fig. 6F). Glucose metabolism was also disrupted by space ight as the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2 ) gene, required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion137, and glycogen synthase 2(Gys2) gene, the rate limiting enzyme for glycogenesis138,w e r ed o w n - r e g u l a t e di nt h el i v e r( a n di n t e s t i n e )a f t e rb o t h2 9 d a y sa n d5 6 d a y so fspace ight. The free fatty acid and glycolysis regulating PPAR was also downregulated, and liver glycogen phosphorylase ( Pygl) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta ( Gsk3)w e r es i g n i cantly upregulated after 56 days https:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 11of space ight (Fig. 6G). Taken together, the indicated decrease in glycogen synthesis and increase in glycogenolysis is characteristic of insulin resistance leading to the elevated fasting plasma glucose to pre-diabetic levels pre-viously observed in crew of the Mars500 analogue mission and during space ight 139 141. Interestingly, in light of space ight induced changes to gut microbiota, upregulation of Gsk3is also known to be activated by microbial-associated molecular patterns142and promotes acute liver failure through inhibition of the PPAR pathway143. Other pathways enriched in the liver after space ight included Cushing Syndrome, hypercortisolism consisten t with elevation of cholesterol levels, and hepatocellular cancer pathways. Notably, claudins, which were largelydownregulated in the intestine where they are commonly expressed within tight junctions, were upregulated in liver tissue after 56 days of space ight (Supplementary Data 5), including highly signi cant and high relative abundance increases in CLDN1 andCLDN2 . So-called non-tight junction claudins have only recently been experimentally explored and, in hepatic cells, CLDN1 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 144.M o r e broadly, signi cant upregulation of Tgf-and genes involved in complex Tgf-signalling ( Tgfb2 ,Tgfb3 ,Tab2 ,Tgfbrap ,Smad3 ), alongside other markers ( Dapk2 ,Vegfa ,Dvl3)145,146are associated to HCC, as well as immune suppression through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A ( p21cip1; Cdkn1a )147,a l s os i g n i cantly upregulated after 29 and 56 days of space ight. Previous gene expression analysis of mice exposed to high-energy ionparticle radiation to simulate exposure to Galactic Cosmic Rays reportedinduction of spontaneous HCC 146. These prominent transcriptomic shifts a f t e r5 6d a y so fs p a c e ight, if re ected in longer term studies in humans, could represent a serious health concern. Discussion A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth. An importantassociated shortfall of this research is the lack of assessment of inter-cagevariation. The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use ofdistinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide so me biological and technical con dence in the space ight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced s tatistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the i mminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacityof their experimental habitats and gr owth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in orde r to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. This research also lacked truly independent cohorts of mice, as Liver Animal Return (29 days space ight) and ISS (56 days space ight), and their respective ground controls, derived f rom the same initial cohort of mice. Future studies should ensure common data gathering approaches to enablehigh resolution multiomic data to be d irectly compared across missions and different cohorts of mice. Integra tion of metagenomic and host tran- scriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the mul- tiomic response to space ight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture and public multiomic resources such a s GeneLab. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened thisresearch and future studies should aim to quantitatively pro le the speci cdeconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system. Alongside metatranscriptomic analysis of the gut microbiome, thiswould represent an important next step lik ely to help clarify the directionality of the host-gut microbiome responses associated to space ight pathology. Conclusions Through metagenomic assessment o f the murine gut microbiome, sig- nicant space ight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identi ed. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after space ight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as whenusing distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changescoincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gutmicrobiome interface which are critica l to barrier function, microbe inter- actions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation.Collectively, these multiomic ndings suggest host-gut microbiome inter- actions during space ight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health. Methods Experimental design Female 32 weeks-old C57BL6NTac mic e (Taconic Biosciences sources) from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were com-pared: ight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal return (GC_LAR), ight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS (GC_ISS) (Fig. 1). FLT_ISS and FLT_LAR mice comprised 40 mice that were launched on SpaceX-13 and transferred to the rodent research habitaton the ISS whereas their matched ground controls, GC_ISS and GC_LAR,were 40 mice kept in identical rodent habitats at Kennedy Space Centre. Notall mice were available to NASA GeneLab for DNA and RNA extractions(replicate numbers provided bel ow). Diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001) and deionized autoclaved water were provided ad libitum , and a 12:12 h dark light cycle maintained. After 29 days of ight onboard the ISS, FLT_LAR mice were returned to earth as part of the Live Animal Return (13118) andsacriced alongside GC_LAR using common processing at ages of 41 weeks old (16118). FLT_ISS mice were sacri ced after 53 56 days of ight onboard the ISS at the same time as GC_ISS mice at the Kennedy SpaceCentre at 44 weeks old using a common timeline and methodology. During this period in the Destiny module (US laboratory) on the ISS, the mice were exposed to an average daily 165.8 Gy d 1Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) dose and 117.3 Gy d1South Atlantic Anomaly (energetic protons) dose (data provided by Ames Life Sciences Data Archive -ALSDA). This is in line with stand ard range of exposure on the ISS 148,a n d represents around a 100 increase to common exposure on earth. The temperature, relative humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels on the ISSwere mimicked in the ground control ro dent habitats at the Kennedy Space over the 56 days of space ight, so were not signi cantly different ( t-test, p 0.05) between ight and ground controls, and averaged 22.75 (0.35) C, 41.49 (2.28)  and 3219 (340) CO 2ppm, respectively.

These comprised downregulation ofimmune response pathways, similar to those seen in the intestine, as well as steroid metabolism, type I diabetes mellitus, in ammatory bowel disease and NAFLD. Space ight also led to common upregulation of insulin resistance, Hippo signalling, inositol phosphate metabolism, Cushing syndrome and hepatocellular cancerpathways at both 29 and 56 days. Certain pathways were different over time. After 29 days of space ight, long-term depression and maturity onset diabetes of the young pathways were upregulated, whereas after 56 days, bile secretion and circa-dian rhythm were downregulated, while glycolysisgluconeogenesis pathway were upregulated.https:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 12Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As outlined in the NASA Genelab record ( OSD-249 ), Anaesthesia for the LAR mice groups was induced using isourane. For the ISS mice groups, anaesthesia was administered via intraperitoneal injection of ketamin e, xylazine, and acepromazine during the dissection period, which occurred 53 56 days post-launch. Blood samples were obtained via closed-chest cardiac puncture, though these were not used in this study. Euthanasia was performed by exsanguination fol-lowed by thoracotomy. The ISS space ight mice carcasses underwent hind limb dissection, which was not used in this study, then were wrapped inaluminium foil, placed in Ziploc bags, and stored at 80 C or colder until return. The ISS Ground Control follo wed the same euthanasia methods and preservation timeline at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Experimental end-points included the collection of blo od samples, completion of hind limb dissection, and collection of faecal s amples. Faecal samples were extruded from the colon during dissection, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at80 C. Additionally, liver and colon (RNASeq explored here), and spleen, lung, thymus, and dorsal skin samples were collected for furtheranalysis. DNA extraction Faecal samples from 32 RR6 mice were available for DNA extraction: n9 mice from FLT_LAR, n7m i c ef r o mG C _ L A R , n7m i c ef r o mF L T _ I S S andn 9 mice from GC_ISS. DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) ( OSD- 249). Half of a frozen faecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenised using tissue homogenising bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet B lender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 min at 4 C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 C and21,000 g to de ate foam. The supernatant fr om each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer sp r o t o c o l .D N Aw a s eluted in 105 L RNAse free H 2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNAsamples were measured using Qubit 3 .0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Sci- entic, Waltham, MA) with a Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a gDNA ScreenTapeKit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequence data isavailable in the NASA GeneLab record OSD-249 . 16S rRNA gene ampli cation DNA library preparation was performed by the Genome Research Core (GRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to a two-stage PCR ampli cation protocol149,150.I nt h e rst stage, primers 515 F806 R (Earth Microbiome Project, V4 targeting) con-taining Fluidigm Common Sequence linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded pri-mers were used to amplify PCR products from the rst stage and incor- porate Illumina sequencing adaptors and a sample barcode. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output ow cell, employing paired- end 2  153 base reads. Whole metagenome sequencing Whole metagenome sequence libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according tothe manufacturer s instructions. Input DNA was 100 ng per reaction, and ve cycles of PCR were performed. Index adaptors used were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. Library fragmentsizes (550 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation withD1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Techno logies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured with a KAPA Library quanti cation kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina , San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instru-ment with a 500-cycle SP ow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample P rocessing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center).RNA extraction and sequencing Colon samples from 36 RR6 mice wer e available for RNA extraction: n1 0 mice from FLT_LAR, n8m i c ef r o mG C _ L A R , n9m i c ef r o mF L T _ I S S andn 9 mice from GC_ISS. Liver samples from 39 mice were available for RNA extraction: n1 0m i c ef r o mF L T _ L A R , n 9 mice from GC_LAR, n1 0 m i c e f r o m F L T _ I S S a n d n1 0 m i c e f r o m G C _ I S S . R N A w a s extracted from mouse tissue samples using an AllPrep DNARNA Mini Kit(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenisation buffer for RNA puri cation was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen,Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozencolon ( OSD-247 )o rl i v e r( OSD-245 ) tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution.Homogenisation was performed us ing tissue homogenising bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0 mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24(Next Advance) for 5 min at 4 C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 L RNAse free H 2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-InMixes (Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA Cat 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at theconcentrations suggested by the manufacturer sp r o t o c o l . Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Input RNA amounts were 500 ng; RNA RIN values were  4. Index adaptors were 1.5 M (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles of PCR were performed.Library fragment sizes (300 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200TapeStation with a D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, SantaClara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCRMaster Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilming ton, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on an IlluminaNovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP ow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center) and all RNA sequencing data is provided for in the NASA GeneLab records OSD-247 (colon) or OSD-245 (liver). 16S rRNA gene barcoding Amplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor28,35,139,151,152. Exact sequence variants (ESV) were identi ed in place of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)153,154. Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur155and a count threshold parameter of 96. Annotation at family, genus or species-level used BLASTn criteria of 99identity and coverage to the NCBI 16 S curated and NCBI nrnt databases(January 2022 versions). Differentia lly abundant ESVs were manually assessed for quality. When the high est identitycoverage was shared amongst multiple different references, all annotations were retained andreported. Differential abundance analy sis was performed using DESeq2 156,157, which performs well with sparse data and uneven library sizes158. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single samplewas required to be 90 of the count in all samples, and ESV counts wererequired to be 0 in at least 3 samples from the same group 35.Af a l s e discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hoch berg procedure) 0.1 correction was applied159. Whole metagenome sequencing co-assembly and annotation Quality control used Trim Galore! (v0.6.6)160, a wrapper script to automate quality and adaptor trimming as wel l as quality control. Trim Galore is based on cutadapt (v2.10)161and fastqc (v0.11.5)162.T r i mG a l o r e !P A R A - METERS : --trim-n --max_n 0 --pai red --retain_unpaired --phred33 --length 75 -q 5 --stringency 1 -e 0.1 -j 1. BBMAP163was used to removehttps:doi.org10.1038s41522-024-00545-1 Article npj Bio lms and Microbiomes  (2024) 10:71 13potential contamination from huma n using the masked version of hg19 human assembly. To remove redundancy in read dataset and reduce thecomputational load, reads were normalised using ORNA 164with the fol- lowing parameters: -sorting 1 -base 1.7 -kmer 21. MEGAHIT v1.2.9165was used to assemble reads from all samples into one co-assembly using meta-large option. Kallisto (v0.46.2)166expectation maximisation algorithm was used to co mplete metagenomics read assign- ment and infer contig abundance167. Prodigal (v2.6.3)168was used with the option meta to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and BLAST v2.3.0169 was used to annotate contigs sequence. To assign contig taxonomy, a rst alignment iteration was run using full contig lengths against the NCB I nrnt database (January 2022) and Reference Viral Database (RVDB v v25.0). To further resolve nucleotidetaxonomic annotation, a second align ment was run against all databases which included selected genomes (additional 1148 sequences) from NCBI refseq informed by rst iteration. BLASTn was run using the following parameters: -evalue 1e-50 -word_size 128 -per c_identity 97. Contig align- ment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bit-score was selected as the best alignment for a given contig. Descriptivestatistics were also provided for con tigs with a common species annotation that had an average alignment identity  97, total alignmentlength  3000 nt and an average query coverage  20. To validate ESVsequences using the metagenomics de novo assembly, ESVs were aligned toWMS contigs using BLASTn. To annotate genes, three protein databases (NCBI nr, UniProtKB Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL; January 2022) were searched using the translated sequences of the predicted proteins. BLASTx was run with the following parameters: -evalue 1e-10 -word_size 6 -threshold 21. Alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore wasselected as the best alignment for a given orf. GO, pfam, PANTHER, EMBL,InterPro, HAMAP, TIGRFAMs, STRING, HOGENOM, SUPFAM termswere mined from UniProtKB database. Amino acid sequences were used asinput in the GhostKOALA webserver 170to add functional genes and path- ways information. KEGG functional and taxonomic annotation wasretrieved using complete and incomplete pathways. Extibacter muris strain DSM28560 bile acid-inducible operon sequence (baiBCDEFGHI) 62,w e r e manually added to default KEGG data base. One bai sequence did not have a KEGG term associated to it (baiG MFS tr ansporter; bile acid transporter) and a temporary KEGG term was assigned to it (K9999). Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) Using metagenome co-assembly from 3.4.2, genome binning was per-formed using MetaBAT2 171. Genome quality estimation of all bins was performed using CheckM (version v1.1.6)172. Taxonomic classi cation was performed with Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) a pipeline for the taxonomic classi cation of metagenome assembled genomes173. Murine transcriptome reference mapping Mouse liver and colon RNA-Seq reads were processed and assembled fol- lowing NASA GeneLab consensus pip eline, as described previously174. Alpha and beta diversity To estimate and compare mi crobial richness within samples, alpha diversity was measured using diversity in dices using Phyloseq R library175and was compared between groups with t-tests (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric) tests. Unsupervised multivariate analysis (ordination) was performed using Principal Coordi nate Analysis (PCoA) with normal- ised counts (Supplementary Data 1) wh ile constrained ordination was based on distance-based Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CCA).Signicance of constraints were assessed using ANOVA-like permutation testing for CCA (anova.cca). Vegan R library 176was used to conduct these analyses, statistics, and to produce graphs and draw dispersion ellipses. Asan exploratory visualisation of anno tated WMS contigs, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to reduce the dimen-sionality of beta diversity WMS contig count matrices. CPM normalisedcounts of differentially abundant sp ecies (30 in each comparison) were selected as input and umap function from the umap R package (v 0.2.10) wasused for each comparison with defau lt parameters. Care should be taken when interpreting relative abundances as amplicon-based and WMS microbiome pro ling lacks absolute quanti cation and is vulnerable to biases from PCR ampli cation andor sequencing depth. Differential abundanceexpression analysis Prior to differential abundance analysis, sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESVcontigtra nscript count in a single sample must be 90 of the count across all samples and ESVcontig occurrence must beat least 3 in samples within the same design factor. Differential abundance (or expression) analysis was performed using DESeq2 159based on pre-processed raw abundance of ESVscon- tigsORFstranscripts. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini- Hochberg procedure) 0.1 was applied for statistical signi cance156. Missingness is a known challenge for negative binomial regressionmodels (such as used in DESeq2) when analyzing zero-in ated abun- dance tables 177,178, contigs with an absolute zero across all replicated samples belonging to a same factor were assumed to be structural zerosandagged as signi cantly differentially abundant. To address con- servative p-value distribution 179of RNA-Seq differential expression analysis, local FDR values were computed from DESeq2 p-values using fdrtool (v1.2.17)180Rl i b r a r y . Functional enrichment analysis Ghostkoala output was organised in to a gene count table using WMS ORF raw count table and used as input for over-representation analysis (ORA) ofWMS data. ORA was used to statistically test the overlap between DA ORFs(FDR 0.1) and a geneset using pathways of interest (Supplementary Data4).p-values were calculated using a hypergeometric test using clusterPro ler (v4.7.1.003) R library 181. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNASeq data was performed on the Webgestalt182platform using the entire gene list, rank-ordered combining signi cance and effect size from DESe q2 differential expression analysis, i.e. log2(FC) -log(pValue)183. Gene symbols were inferred from assembly transcripts using org.Mm.eg.db (v3.16)184R annotation library.

        "conclusion": "s Through metagenomic assessment o f the murine gut microbiome, sig- nicant space ight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identi ed. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after space ight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as whenusing distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changescoincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gutmicrobiome interface which are critica l to barrier function, microbe inter- actions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation.Collectively, these multiomic ndings suggest host-gut microbiome inter- actions during space ight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health.",
