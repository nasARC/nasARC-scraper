Our human space exploration efforts are at a unique transition point in history, with more crewed launches and human presence in space than ever before1. We can attribute this to the commercial space ight sector entering an industrial renaissance, with multiple companies formingcollaborative and competitive networks to send commercial astro- nauts into space. The recent advancements in human space explora- tion offer a signi cant chance to gather more biological research samples and enhance our comprehension of space ight s effects onReceived: 2 May 2023 Accepted: 15 May 2024 Check for updates A full list of af liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: chm2042med.cornell.edu Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4964 11234567890():,; 1234567890():,;human health. This is vital, as our knowledge of the biological reactions to the unique environment of space, marked by microgravity and thespace radiation, remains incomplete 2. The impact of space ight on human health includes musculoskeletal deconditioning3, cardiovas- cular adaptations4,v i s i o nc h a n g e s5, space motion sickness6, neuro- vestibular changes7,i m m u n ed y s f u n c t i o n8, and increased risk of rare cancers9,a m o n go t h e rc h a n g e s2. However, we are still at the initial stages of documenting biological responses to space ight exposure at the molecular and cellular resolution. Prior work has characterized molecular changes that occur during space ight in astronauts. These include changes in cytokine proles8,10,11, urinary albumin abundance12, and hemolysis13. Further- more, multiomic assays have provided genomic maps of structuralchanges in DNA 1416, RNA expression pro les11,17,18, sample-wide pro- tein measurements17,19,20, and metabolomic status17. Additionally, International Space Station (ISS) surfaces have been studied with longitudinal microbial pro les to track microbial pathogenicity and evolution to assess their potential in uence on crew health21,22.T o better improve our understanding of both human and microbialbiology in space, it is critical that these analyses continue and expandas more spacecraft and stations are built and own. Combining and comparing work from prior missions in these new spacecraft and stations is especially important to overcome the smallsample sizes and highlights a need for standardization between mis-sions. In addition, recruiting large cohorts of astronauts is dif cult, as the ISS typically can only house up to six astronauts at a time. As of the time of writing, only 647 humans have been to space, starting with the launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961. Studies have spanned the Vostok pro-gram, Project Mercury, the Voskhod program, Project G emini, Project Apollo, the Soyuz program, the Salyut space stations, MIR, the SpaceShuttle Program, SkyLab, Tiangong Space Station, and the ISS. From the breadth of experiments that have been performed on the ISS, only aminority have speci cally been human research-oriented 23,24,a n dj u s ta subset involve omics studies. The NASA Twin Study created the most in-depth multi-omic study of astronau ts prior to Inspiration4, but was limited to one astronaut and one ground control 17. These factors have limited the statistical power of astronaut omic experiments and increased the dif culty of providing robust scienti c conclusions. Standardizing biospecimen collections across multiple missions willcreate larger sample sets needed to draw these conclusions. Here, we establish the standard biospecimen sample collection and banking procedures for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). Akey goal of SOMA is to standardize biospecimen collection and pro- cessing for space ight, to generate high-quality multi-omics data across space ight investigations, and to enable follow-up experiments with viably frozen cells and biobanked samples. This paper provides samplecollection methods bu ilt for standardized eld collections across dif- ferent crews and missions. We cover the decentralized sample collec- tion process from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission from the point of collection to the preservation of s amples for downstream biochemical and omics processing at our centralized lab at Weill Cornell Medicine(WCM). These protocols can produ ce synchronized datasets with enhanced statistical stren gth, amplifying our scienti cndings from space ight studies. Additionally, we showcase metrics related to sample collection outputs, references of past astronaut sample collections inscienti c publications, and suggestions to re ne sample collection for upcoming missions. In its inaugural use case, these samples were col-lected from the I4 astronaut cohort and are currently in use for severalother missions (Polaris Dawn, Axiom-2), which will enable continuedutilization for future crewed space missions. Results Biospecimen collection overview We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide rangeof biospecimen samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots(DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, skin biopsies, and environ- mental swabs (Fig. 1a). The collection of various types of samples covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supple-mentary Table 1), but also enabled newer omics technologies, such as spatially resolved, single-molecule, and single-cell assays. For the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three-time points pre-launch (L-92, L-44, L-3 days), three-time points during ight (Flight Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four-time points post-return (R  1, R  45,R  82, R  194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin biopsies werecollected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva,a n ds k i ns w a b sw e r ec o l l e c t e db o t ho nt h eg r o u n da n dd u r i n g ight (Fig. 1b). Environmental swabs of the Dragon capsule were collected pre-ight in the crew training capsule and during ight in the space- craft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig. 1b). Samples were collected across a variety of locations based on the crew s training and travel schedule. L-92 and L-44 were collected in Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L-3 and R  1 were collected atCape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and FD3were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R  45 wascollected at the crew members individual locations (which spanned the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R  82 was collected at Weill CornellMedicine, NY and R  194 was collected at Baylor College of Medicine,TX (Fig. 1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed within 16 hours of collection. All samples from the ight were pro- cessed immediately after retrieval from the ight. Samples were stored at 80 C at each site immediately after processing and aliquoting (processing steps are outlined below). All samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight Shipping to WeillCornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Bio-bank (CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoamboxes and spent 2 days in transit. No samples were shipped on aThursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. All samplesarrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry-ice still in the packaging andsamples frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to 80 C for long-term storage and biobanking. Any exceptions to this process willbe noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 sample aliquots, whichwere then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays (Supplementary Table 2). Some samples were processed immediately at eld laboratory facilities (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). DNA and RNA yields are also reported below from col- lection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM. Blood collection and derivatives Blood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes tocollect venous blood and contact-activated lancets to collect capillaryblood from the ngertip. Each crew member provided blood samples, collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BDVacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes (CPTs), one Streck cell-free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (SST), and one DBS card per time point. Tubeswere transported from the collection site to the eld laboratory at room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs,serum, and cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table 3).Sample yields are reported below. Samples were aliquoted for long-term storage and biobanking (Supplementary Table 4). bRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Fig. 2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04 g tube of total RNA across all samples, and the RNA integrity number(RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig. 2b). RNA was stored at 80 C after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of downstream RNA pro ling methods. It will allow comparative studies to prior RNA-sequencing performed on astronauts, particularlysnoRNA  lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle erablood 25,26, mRNA  miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18, and whole blood RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yieldsArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48806-z Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4964 2are more than suf cient to perform direct-RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which require500 ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer s protocol, ONT kit SQK- RNA002). This enables the study of RNA modi cation changes during space ight to create epitranscriptomic pro les for the rst time in astronauts. Four K2 EDTA tubes were drawn at each timepoint from each crew member (Fig. 2c). One K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diag- nostics to perform a complete blood count (CBC, Quest Test Code:6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and particles(EVPs) for proteomic quanti cation (Fig. 3a). Total EVP quantities varied from 2.71-28.27 ug (Fig. 2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to isolate PBMCs for single-cell sequencing (10X Chromium Single CellMultiome ATAC  Gene Expression and Chromium Single Cell ImmuneProling work ows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was per- formed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000-975,000 cellsper mL of blood (Fig. 2e). One prior single-cell gene expression experiment, NASA Twin study, was performed on astronauts, whichfound immune cell population speci cg e n ee x p r e s s i o nc h a n g e sa n da correlation with microRNA signatures 11,18. Additional PBMCs, plasma, and serum were collected from CPTs (Fig. 4a), cfDNA BCTs (Fig. 4d), SSTs (Fig. 4c), as well as red blood cell pellets. CPTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer s instructions (Fig. 3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 3000- 14,000 uL per tube (Fig. 4d). Because of technical issues in the sample processing procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrie-val from the CPT tubes was not possible. Plasma can be used to validate or refute previous studies, including cytokine panel 10,29, exosomal RNA-seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,3133 results. PBMCs were also collected, aliquoted into 6 cryovials per CPT, and stored in liquid nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to-80 C.

The remaining cell pellet mixture was frozen at 20 C. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged from 1500-5000 uL (Fig. 4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at -80 C. cfDNA extracted from these tubes can be analyzed for fragmentlength, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell type or tissue oforigin 4042. The SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer s instructions (Fig. 3d). Serum volume ranged from 2000-8000 uL per timepoint (Fig. 4f). Similar to plasma, serum can be allocated for cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensivemetabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest TestCode: 10231) for metrics on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose,potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic markers. The remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at 20 C. In addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a DBS card using a contact-activated lancet pressed against the n- gertip (Fig. 5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Eachof the ve spots on the DBS card hold 75-80uL of capillary blood, however, the amount of capillary blood collected across timepointsvaried (Fig. 5b, c) according to how much blood could be collected before the lancet-puncture closed. Saliva collection Saliva was collected at the L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R  1, R  45,and R  82 timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collectedusing the OMNIgene Oral Kit (OME-505), which preserves nucleic acids(Fig. 6a) during the ground timepoints. From these samples, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to3187.8 ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2 ng (less the two samples hadconcentrations too low for measurement), and protein concentrationfrom 92.97 to 93.15 ng. Second, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was collected into a 5 mL DNaseRNase-free screw top tube during theground and ight timepoints. Saliva vol ume varied from 150 to 4000 uL per tube (Fig. 6b). Crude saliva was also collected during ight (FD2 and FD3), in addition to th e ground timepoints. Saliva collections have been conducted throughout space ight studies for assessing the immune state of crews, particularly in thecontext of viral reactivation.

Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be asymptomatic, debilitating, or even life-threatening, thus assessingthese adaptations is bene cial in understanding viral space ight activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic acid quanti-cation, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed, including measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehy- droepiandrosterone (DHEA), and cytokines, among others 10,4346. Urine collection Urine was collected in sterile specimen cups at the L-92, L-44, L-3, R  1, R  45, and R  82 timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1-2 timesper day. For preservation, urine was aliquoted and stored at -80 C.Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) addedbefore freezing, to preserve nucleic acids. Samples yielded23155.5 mL of crude urine and 21 - 112 mL of UCB urine per specimen cup (Fig. 7a). Urine was split into 1 mL - 15 mL aliquots before freezing at -80 C. A wide variety of assays can be performed on urine samples. Previous studies have included viral reactivation 43,46,47,u r i n a r y cortisol48,49, iron and magnesium measurements5053, bone status5456, kidney stones54,55, proteomics11, telomere measurements57, and various biomarkers and metabolites17,49,5861. Stool collection Stool was collected at the L-92, L-44, R  1, R  45, and R  82 time- points. Stool samples were stored into two collection containers ateach timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene Gut (OMR 200) kit with a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME 200) with a pre- servative for metabolomics (Fig. 7b). Stool was the least consistent sample collected due to the limited windows available for sampling during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA were extracted from ali-quots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR 200) tubes for downstream microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660 ng, RNAf r o m6 9 0t o2 0 1 0n g( F i g . 7c). Large variations in yield are attributable to variable stool mass collected between kits. Stool samples enable various biochemical, immune, and micro- biome changes studies. Previous metagenomic assays have found thatshannon alpha diversity and richness during long-duration missions tothe ISS 62. Skin swabs Body swabs were collected at all timepoints. Samples were collected byswabbing the body region of interest for 30 seconds, then placing theswab in a sterile 2D matrix tube (Thermo Scienti c 3710) with Zymo DNARNA shield preservative. For the rst two swab locations, the oral and nasal cavity, the swab was placed directly on the body afterremoval from its sterile packaging (dry-swab method; Fig. 8a). For the remaining body locations, the swab was brie yd i p p e di nn u c l e a s e - free, DNARNA-free water before proceeding (wet-swab method).Eight distinct sites were swabbed with the wet-swab method: post- auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, and the toe-web space (Fig. 8b). The astronaut microbiome has previously been studied in the forehead, forearm,nasal, armpit, navel, postauricular, and tongue body locations, andchanges have been documented during ight. Changes in alpha diversity and beta diversity were documented, as well as shifts inmicrobial genera 62. However, the impact of these changes on skin health and immunological health are not well understood. Acquiring extensive swab samples from the crew skin allows for characterization of th e habitat environment, crew skin microbiome adaptations, and interactions with po tential human health adaptations resulting from space ight exposure. This is very relevant for crew health, considering astronauts become more susceptible to infections during space ight missions63, with the relationship between microbe-host interactions from space ight exposure, which may be a causative factor of astronauts immune dysfunction, which is still not well understood.

Biopsies were also collected in advance of a ight to ensure the biopsy site is fully healed before the ight so there is no risk of complication. The wet-swab method was used to collect theskin microbiome before the skin biopsy. The skin biopsies were 3 4 millimeters in diameter and were collected for histology andspatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) (Fig. 8c). One-third of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. The remaining two-thirds of the sample was stored in a cryovial and placed at -80 C for SRT (Fig. 8c). This is the rst sample collected from astronauts for spatially resolved tran- scriptomics. The skin is of high interest due to the in ammation- related cytokine markers such as IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL-18 10,17and skin rash s status as the most frequent clinical symptom reported during space ight64. Environmental swabs and HEPA lter Environmental swabs were collected in ight during the F1 and F2 timepoint. Additionally, environmental swabs were collected from theight simulation capsule at SpaceX headquarters after days of crew training during the L-92 and L-44 timepoints. Environmental swabswere collected using the wet-swab method. Ten environmental swabs were collected per time point at the following locations in the capsule: an ambient aircontrol swab, the execute button, the viewing dome,the side hatch mobility aid, the lid of the waste locker, the head sectionof one of the seats, the commode panel, the right and left sides of thecontrol screen, and the g-meter button (Fig. 9a-d).

The potential impact of this in uence on pathogenesis is a concern for long-duration space missions, especially given that changes in host-pathogen interactions may also be affected during space ight 67. Discussion We report here on biospecimen samples collected from the SpaceX I4 Mission, the most comprehensive human biological specimen collec-tion effort performed on an astronaut cohort to date. The extensivearchive of biospecimens included venous blood, dried blood spotcards, saliva, urine, stool, microbiome body swabs, skin biopsies, andenvironmental capsule swabs. The study objective was to establish afoundational set of methods for biospecimen collection and banking on commercial space ight missions suitable for multi-omic and molecular analysis. Biospecimens were collected to enable compre-hensive, multi-omic pro les, which can then be used to develop molecular catalogs with higher resolution of human responses tospace ight. Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were alsoperformed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and samples and viable cells were preserved in a long-term Cornell Aero-space Medicine Biobank, such that additional assays and measures canbe conducted in the future. Great care was put into the standardization of sample processing between eld laboratories in Hawthorne, Cape Canaveral, and Hous- ton. Despite our best efforts to control for all preanalytical variables 68, there are some inconsistencies in sample processing that were una-voidable during this mission. Of note, there was no access to coldstowage during ight, causing all samples to be stowed at room tem- perature until they arrived back on Earth. Of the three sample types collected during ight, two were stable at room temperature (skin capsule swabs stored in DNARNA shield and capillary blood collectedon dried blood spot cards). The third (saliva samples), were not storedin a preservative and, for this reason, will have a distinct pro le com- pared to other timepoints. This limits the context in which thesesamples will be useful, but will still provide biological insights in moretargeted biological studies. We can imagine situations in the futurewhere there will be tradeoffs between standardization of sample col-lection with previous missions and mission-speci c constraints in u- encing the selection of biospecimen collection methods. However, there are several reasons why rigorous biospecimen collection methods for commercial and private space ight missions must be developed, which are scalable and translational across populations, missions, and mission parameters. First, little is knownabout the biological and clinical responses that occur in civiliansduring and after space travel. While professional astronauts are gen-erally young, healthy, and extensively trained, civilian astronauts have a bCrude Urine Urine with UCBUrine Volume Crew ID Crew IDYield (mL) Yield (mL) Stool Collections L-92 L-44 L-3 R1 R45 R82 Gut MetcStool DNA YieldYield (ng)L-92 L-44 R45 R82 Stool RNA Yield L-92 L-44 R45 R82Yield (ng)Crew ID Crew IDSubject C001 C002 C003 C004 L-92 L-44 L-3 R1 R45 R82 L-92 L-44 L-3 R1 R45 R82 Fig. 7  Urine and Stool Sample Collections. a Urine volumes per timepoint.

They will possess a variety of phenotypes, including older ages, different health back- grounds, and greater medication use, and may experience differentmedical conditions, risks, and comorbidities. Careful molecular char-acterization will be bene cial for the development of appropriate baseline metrics and countermeasures and, therefore, bene cial for the individual space ight experience. In the future, such analyses may enable precision medicine applications aimed at optimizing counter-measures for each individual astronaut who enters and returns safelyfrom space 69,70. Second, multi-omic studies inherently present a large number of measurements within a small set of subjects. These high-dimensional datasets present numerous potential challenges with regard to the ampli cation of noise, risk of over tting, and false discoveries71.A ta l l times, scientists engaged in multi-omic analyses must take special carethat true biological variance is what has been measured. The intro-duction of experimental variance through the progression from sam-ple collection, transport, and storage, to sequencing and analysis canintroduce artifacts of variance that render the detection of true bio-logical variance and interpretation of results more dif cult. For this reason, tight adherence to experim ental controls or annotation at every step of the experimental condition is crucial. Careful annotationallows for the assignment of class variables in post hoc analysis. Amongsuch applications are the attempt to detect batch effects or determine the impact of variations in temperature (collection, storage, or transport) 72. The necessary means to address experimental variance are long- itudinal sampling and specimen aliquoting. Longitudinal sampling (i.e.collecting numerous serial samples from each test condition) frompre-ight, in- ight, and post- ight allows for greater statistical power when assessing changes attributable to space ight. In addition, each sample collected should be divided upon collection into multiple ali-quots. This better assures that freeze-thaw cycles can be avoided in theanalysis stage, as freeze-thaw events can introduce considerableexperimental variance depending on the molecular class being mea-sured. Maintaining all samples at their optimal storage temperature atall times, typically -80 C or lower (e.g. liquid nitrogen for cells), iscrucial 73. Special attention must be given to how the collection and storage methods in- ight vary in relation to the conditions on Earth. Space ight presents considerable differences in the operating envir- onment, where ground conditions are far easier to control than ight. In practice, this may limit the types of samples that can be collected during ight. Third, rigorous methods must be developed and followed to pursue comparisons across missions with varying design para-meters. In this consideration, there is an argument for the devel-opment of specimen collection, transport, storage, processing,analysis, and reporting standards. At the same time, this must bebalanced with the exibility required for innovation since standards can sometimes limit advancement in methodology. In the presentstudy, common methods were used for the I4 and the Polaris Dawnand Axiom-2 missions. However, selected methods may requireoptimization for Polaris Dawn-like missions, to increase the yields during sample processing and adapt to unique parameters imposed by the anticipated spacewalk (extravehicular activity; EVA). More-over, within standards or best practices, unique research for eachmission may require alteration of previously successful methods.With these considerations in mind, we must balance methodology Fig. 8  Skin Collection Locations and Sample Types. a Dry swabs were collected from two body locations. bWet swabs were collected from eight body locations. cSwabs were collected from the deltoid region.

As the commercial space ight sector gains momentum and more astronauts with different health pro les and backgrounds have access to space, comprehensive data on the biological impact of short-duration space ight is of paramount importance. Such data will fur- ther expand our understanding and knowledge of how space ight affects human physiology, microbial adaptations, and environmental biology. The use of integrative omics technologies for civilian astro- nauts has revealed novel responses across genomics, proteomics,metabolomics, microbiome, and transcriptomics measures 7483. Creating multi-omic datasets from space ight studies on astronaut cohorts will further advance our understanding, inform future missionplanning, and help discover what appropriate countermeasures can bedeveloped to minimize future risk and enhance performance. Validating sample collection methodologies initially in short- duration commercial space ight is a key step for future human health research in long-duration and exploration-class missions tothe Moon and beyond. To help meet these challenges, we haveestablished the SOMA protocols, which detail standard multi-omic measures of astronaut health and protocols for sample collection from astronaut cohorts. Although the all-civilian I4 crew pioneeredtherst use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here is robust and generalizable, making it applicable to future astronautcrews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., SpaceX, AxiomSpace, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA, ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, andprocessing methods are a springboard for continuing biospecimenanalysis and expanding our knowledge of multi-omic dynamicsbefore, during, and after human space ight missions, providing a molecular roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possi-ble countermeasures. Methods Venous blood draw Venipuncture was performed on each subject using a BD VacutainerSafety-Lok blood collection set (BD Biosciences, 367281) and a Vacutainer one-use holder (BD Biosciences, 364815). The puncturesite was located near the cubital fossa and was sterilized with a BZKantiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Blood was col-lected into 1 serum separator tube (SST, BD Biosciences: 367987,Lot: 1158449, 1034773), 2 cell processing tubes (CPT, BD Bios-ciences: 362753, Lot: 1133477, 1012161), 1 blood RNA tube (bRNA,PAXgene: 762165, Lot: 1021333), 1 cell-free DNA BCT (cfDNA BCT,Streck: 230470, Lot: 11530331), and 4 K2 EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, 367844, Lot: 0345756) per crew member per time point. For samples collected in Hawthorne, blood was drawnat SpaceX headquarters, then immediately transported to USC forprocessing.

SST tubes were recapped and stored at 20 C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. Cell processing tubes were centrifuged at 1800xg for 30 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at-80 C. 5 mL of 2 FBS (ThermoFisher, 26140079) in PBS (Thermo-Fisher, 10010023) was added to the CPT tube to resuspend PBMCs.PBMC suspension was transferred to a clean 15 mL conical tube. Thetotal volume was brought to 15 mL with 2 FBS in PBS. The tube wascentrifuged for 15 minutes at 300x g. Supernatant was discarded. PBMCs were resuspended 6 mL of 10 DMSO (Millipore Sigma,D4540-500mL) in FBS. 1 mL of PBMCs were moved to 6 cryogenic vials (Corning, 8672). Cryovials were placed in a Mr. Frosty TM(Ther- moFisher, 5100-0001) and stored at -80 C. CPTs were recapped andstored at 20 C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. There was one outlier to this sample collection, the R  194 timepoint, where CPTsodium citrate tubes were used (BD Biosciences, Cat no. 362760). cfDNA BCTs were centrifuged at 300xg for 20 minutes. Plasma was transferred to a 15 mL conical tube. Plasma was centrifuged5000xg for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of plasma were aliquoted into1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 C. cfDNA BCTs wererecapped and stored at 20 C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. PAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed according to the manufacturer si n s t r u c t i o n s .B r i e y, tubes were left upright for a minimum of 2 hours before freezing at 20 C. For RNA extraction, tubes were thawed and processe d with the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, 762164). Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) Isolation One 4 mL K2 EDTA tube was shipped on ice overnight to WCM forprocessing. Blood was centrifuged at 500x gfor 10 minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 3000 x g for20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 C forEVP isolation. Plasma volumes ranged between 0.6 - 1.7 ml. Plasma was later thawed for downstream processing, when concentrations were measured. Plasma samples were thawed on ice, and EVPs were isolatedby sequential ultracentrifugation (Hoshino et al., 2020). Samples werecentrifuged at 12,000x gfor 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman CoulterOptima XE or XPE ultracentrifuge at 100,000x gfor 70 minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at100,000x gfor 70 minutes. The nal EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Dried blood spot (DBS) Crew members warmed their hands and massaged their nger towards thengertip to enrich blood ow toward the puncture site. The puncture site was sterilized using a B ZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Skin was punctured using a contact-activated lan-cet (BD Biosciences, 366593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences,305167), depending on crew member preference. Capillary blood wascollected onto the Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Cytiva,10534612). Blood was transferred by touching only the blood dropletto the surface of the DBS card. DBS cards were stored at room tem-perature with a desiccant pack (Cytiva, 10548239). Saliva To collect crude saliva, crew members uncapped and spit into a sterile, PCR-clean, 5 mL screw-cap tube (Eppendorf, 30122330). Crew spit repeatedly until at least 1 mL was collected. Saliva was transported to asterile ow hood and separated into 500uL aliquots. Aliquots were frozen at -80 C. To collect preserved saliva, crew members used theOMNIgene ORAL kit (OME-505). Crew members spit into the kit st u b euntil they reached the ll line. The tube was re-capped, which released the preservative liquid. Tubes were inverted to mix the saliva andpreservative before being placed at 20 C for storage. After all time- points were collected, DNA, RNA, an d protein were extracted using the AllPrep DNARNAProtein kit (Qiagen, 47054). Sample concentra- tions were measured with Qubit high sensitivity dsDNA and RNAplatform. Proteins were quanti ed with the Pierce R a p i dG o l dB C A Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scienti c, A53225) on Promega GloMax Plate Reader. Urine Crew members urinated into sterile specimen containers (ThermoScienti c, 13-711-56). The container was stored at 4 C until it was prepared for long-term storage. To prepare urine samples for long-term storage, urine was aliquoted into 1 mL, 15 mL, and 50 mL tubes. Half of the urine was immediately placed at 80 C. The other half had urine conditioning buffer (Zymo, D3061-1-140) added to the samplebefore placing in the -80 C freezer. Stool collection Crew members isolated a stool sample using a paper toilet accessory(DNA Genotek, OM-AC1). Stool was transferred into and OMNIgen-eGUT tube (DNAgenotek, OMR 200) and an OMNImet GUT tube (DNA Genotek, ME 200). Tubes were placed at -80 C for long-term storage. For nucleic acid extraction, 200uL of each tube was allocatedfor DNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro kit and 200uL was allocated to RNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerViral kit. The remaining sample was split into 500uL aliquots and re-stored at -80 C. Swab collection Crew members put on gloves and remove a sterile DNARNA swab(Isohelix, SK-4S) from its packaging. For collection of the post-auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, glutealcrease, glabella, toe web space, and capsule environment regions,swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water (this step was skipped fororal and nasal swabs) for ground collections. For in- ight collections, HFactor hydrogen infused water was used in place of nuclease-free water. Each body location was swabbed for 30 seconds, using both sides of the swab. Swabs were then placed in 1 mL Matrix 2D ScrewTubes containing 400uL of DNARNA Shield (Zymo). The tip of theswab was broken off so that only the swab tip was stored in the Matrix2D Screw Tube. Tubes were stored at 4 C. Skin biopsies Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm. Eachsite was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia wasinduced with administration of 1 lidocaine with 1:100,000 epi-nephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately 13and23 sections. The smaller piece was added to a formalin- lled specimen jar. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at -80 C. Surgicaldefects were closed with 1 or 2 5-0 or 4-0 nylon sutures. HEPA lter HEPA Filter was taken apart and sectioned under a chemical hood to avoid contamination. The lter contained two parts, an activated car- bon component and a HEPA lter. The activated carbon component was discarded and the lter was sectioned using a sterile blade. Sec- tions were placed in individual specimen containers and storedat20 C.
