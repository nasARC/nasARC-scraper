Speara aDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, USA ABSTRACT Here, we present 95 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that har- bor antimicrobial resistance genes, isolated from samples obtained in a large ad-vanced wastewater reclamation facility prior to microltration. The MAGs were notin abundance after ltration at the facility and represent a useful resource to thewater treatment community at large. Human society faces an acceleration of water scarcity due to increasing population, pollution, and land use. Such water scarcity also brings a decrease in water quality, as demonstrated by increased eutrophication, among other concerns ( 1). Treatment and reuse of water are critical tools in combating water stress globally. Reuse ofwastewater carries the potential risk of transmission of small-molecule metabolites andantibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) ( 2), while its use relieves stress on natural sources of water. Previously, biolms were sampled from the Orange County Water District(OCWD) Advanced Water Purication Facility (AWPF) in Southern California, whichshowed differences in the microbial communities in both inuent and biolms onmicroltration and reverse osmosis membranes ( 3). In a recent study that more fully characterized both biolms and large volumes of water throughout the treatmentprocess, we described both microbial diversity and load decreasing across this well-engineered system ( 4). Here, we have expanded and enhanced this previous work ( 4) by identifying metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that contain ARGs to expand our knowledge of all microbial lineages harboring ARGs that are present within anultrapuried water facility. Water and biolm were sampled at the OCWD AWPF as previously described ( 4). Briey, all water samples were ltered using a large-volume concentrator (LVC) dialysislter cartridge system (Innova Prep LLC, Drexel, MO). Approximately 60 to 100 liters ofwater were ltered per sample, prior to concentration onto replicate 25-mm (diameter),0.22- H9262m (pore size) nitrocellulose lters. Filters were placed in BashingBead lysis tubes (Zymo, Inc., Irvine, CA) containing 750 H9262l of DNARNA Shield (Zymo, Inc.) to preserve samples onsite. Biolm samples were similarly placed in lysis tubes with DNARNAShield. DNA was extracted using the Zymo Microbiomics DNARNA coextraction kit(Zymo, Inc.). Libraries were prepared as previously described in full ( 4) using the Nextera XT library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), modied to use 13 cycles of PCR. Allsamples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 instrument using PE150 chemistry.Two biolm samples from ltration units at the AWPF obtained from Leddy et al. ( 3) were processed as described previously and sequenced using SE100 chemistry. Se-quence reads were error corrected using BayesHammer v3.12.0 ( 5) and assembled using MEGAHIT v1.1.3 ( 6) to produce a single coassembly. Reads were mapped to the assembly with Bowtie 2 v2.3.4.1 ( 7) and binned into MAGs using Anvio v v5 and CONCOCT ( 8,9). MAG completion and redundancy estimates were also computed within Anvio. MAGs were queried for ARGs using DeepARG ( 10) and identied phylo-Citation Stamps BW, Spear JR. 2020.

Default parameters were used for all software unless otherwise noted. A total of 95 MAGs were selected after manual curation within Anvio and by DeepARG that contained 185 open reading frames putatively identied as antimicrobialresistance genes. Of note, two MAGs were identied by GTDB-Tk as belonging to theCandidatus Gracilibacteria and  Candidatus Patescibacteria lineages ( 12). Others iden- tied included an unclassied Dongiaceae MAG that was previously associated with a wastewater treatment facility ( 13).
