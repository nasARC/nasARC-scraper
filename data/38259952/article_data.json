KEYWORDS transcriptional pro ling, adaptation to space ight, Arabidopsis, microgravity (mg), plants 1 Introduction As an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water ( Fu et al., 2016 ;De Micco et al., 2023 ). Future colonization efforts will require the ability to grow plants in unfamiliar environments. However, the space environment poses challenges to growing plants. In addition to the dif culties of providing essential requirements for plant growth (light, water, nutrients, etc.), growing plants in space requires the mitigation of unfavorable factors such as altered gas composition, lack of convective currents, and cosmic radiation. It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant adaptations to space. Toward that goal, several space ight experiments have examined the global transcriptional changes of plants grown on the International Space Station (ISS). One caveat to these studies is that until recently, lighted habitats for plant experimentation were limited; for ease of handling and setup, several experiments were carried out in Biological Research In Canisters hardware (BRICs), where plants were grown in the dark. Another point of concern is that many space ight experiments have employed hardware-matched experiments on Earth as controls; however, it is dif cult to replicate all of the stresses that plants may face on the ISS on the ground. Further, while several transcriptional datasets have been generated (accessible thr ough the NASA GeneLab data repository), differences in plant age, tissue type, and growth conditions confound efforts to separate primary responses to microgravity from other space ight related stress responses (Manzano et al., 2022 ;Olanrewaju et al., 2023 ). A recent meta- analysis by Barker et al. clearly illustrates some of theseconfounding effects ( Barker et al., 2023 ). The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the space ight experiments. Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses. Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in space ight compared to ground controls.A transcriptional pro ling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-speci c gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots ( Paul et al., 2013 ). Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space. Plant growth is highly responsive to external cues. Two critical cues light and gravity have profound in uences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth. Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravi tropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism). On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling ef cient nutrient acquisition and light capture. The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is dif cult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions. The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the ISS for many years ( Brinckmann, 1999 ;Kittang et al., 2014 ). In addition to providing lighting, regulated air circulation, and ethylene scrubbing, the EMCS was unique in that it consisted of two centrifuge rotors within a growth chamber. Rotor speeds could be varied to impart glevels ranging from 0 - 2 g. The EMCS, therefore, afforded researchers the ability to conduct a simultaneous 1gcontrol in space as well as to speci cally query the effects of partial gravity. Space ight experiments utilizing EMCS hardware have attempted to uncouple light and gravity stimuli ( Millar et al., 2010 ;Vandenbrink et al., 2016 ). Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partial glevels. We previously reported that a subset of genes differentially expressed in microgravity respond to incremental increases in g levels ( Sheppard et al., 2021 ). Other researchers have compared differences in gene expression between Lunar or Martian gravity and onboard 1 gcontrols ( Herranz et al., 2019 ;Villacampa et al., 2021 ). These types of experiments can inform us on plant responsesLand et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 02to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts. In this study, we compare the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis shoots from two independent space ight experiments conducted on the ISS. In both experiments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5-6 days in the EMCS. The results revealed considerable overlap between the two experiments despite differences in the experimental setup. Furthermore, onboard 1 g controls facilitated the identi cation of microgravity-speci c differences in gene expression. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Pre ight ground testing Prior to ight build, optimization was carried out at North Carolina State University with a focus on seed stock viability, experimental protocols, and downstream sample recovery and processing. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seed stocks were carefully screened to obtain an average germination of 99, and dissection and processing protocols were developed to recover 1mgR N Af r o m 3mg input tissue with a high degre e of RNA integrity. Seed storage tests were carried out to ensure the viability of sterilized seeds for at least a 6 month period. Pre ight testing for Plant Signaling (PS) included a Schedule Tes t and Operations Veri cation Test (OVT) at the Norwegian User Support and Operations Center (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), in an Engineering Reference Module (ERM- 1). Similarly, ahead of the Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) space ight, an Experiment Veri cation Test (EVT) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in an EMCS ground facility (ERM-2), and an Operations Verication Test (OVT) in the EMCS Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1) at N-USOC were carried out. All pre ight and ight preparations for seed, media, and hardware assembly were c a r r i e do u ta tN A S AA R C . 2.2 Flight experiment preparation PS and PRR were carried out in the EMCS using the experimental unique equipment (EUE)s which ar e the TROPI-like seed cassettes previously described ( Kiss et al., 2009 ;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2019 ). Whatman 3 blotter paper and black-gridded PES membrane (PALL life Sciences Cat. No. 65561) were cut to t the seed cassettes. Blotter papers were pre-soaked in 0.5X MS media, pH 5.7 (without sucrose) a n da l l o w e dt od r y .B l o t t e rp a p e r sa n dm e m b r a n e sw e r es t e r i l i z e db y autoclaving. Seeds were surface sterilized and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Healthy viable seeds were selec ted under a dissecting microscope and attached to the gridded membrane using guar gum. Seeds were positioned with micropyles pointi ng down (away from lights) with 27 seedsmembrane. Gridded seeded membranes were attached to prepared blotters with guar gum and x e dt oc a s s e t t eb a s ep l a t e s . Cassette covers were installed and sealed with foil tape (3M). A total of 80 cassettes were prepared for each experiment. Seed cassettes wereassembled for ight at NASA ARC and loaded into experimental containers (ECs) approximately 4 weeks prior to the scheduled ight. 2.3 Space ight Onboard the ISS, ECs were loaded into the EMCS by the attending astronaut. Each EC contained 5 seed cassettes for a total of 4 ECs (20 seed cassettes)centrifuge rotor. Experiments were initiated by hydration, controlled remotely. The experimental timelines for PS and PRR are shown in Figure 1 . Both experiments were illuminated by white LEDs along the shoot side of the cassettes, and both experiments consisted of two replicate experimental runs. PS was carried out under continuous lig ht, while PRR employed a long-day light regime (16h light8h dark). I mages were obtained from cameras located within the EMCS chamber. EMCS environmental parameters for PS were set at 21 O 2and a constant seedling temperature of 24C. For PS, the ambient cabin air was purged from the EMCS chamber prior to each experimental run so that CO 2levels gradually increased to equilibrate with the cabin (beginning 370 ppm and equilibrating to 760 ppm). EMCS environmental parameters for PRR were set at 21 O2, 24C daytime seedling temperat ure, and 21C nighttime seedling temperature. Due to constraints with the upmass of air gas canisters, the EMCS chamber was not purged prior to each run of PRR; chamber CO 2for the duration of PRR was similar to the ISS cabin (3000 ppm). In both PS and PRR, environmental factors were monitored by real- time telemetry to record O 2,C O 2, seedling temperature, and relative humidity. At the end of the experiments, seed cassettes were removed from the ECs, with 1 gcassettes handled rst, and frozen immediately in the onboard -80C freezer (MELFI) . Seed cassettes remained frozen onboard the ISS. Samples were maint ained at cryogenic temperature during return via Space-X Dragon, af ter splashdown, and until delivery to the laboratory. Samples were then s tored at -80C until processing for RNA. 2.4 Ground reference controls For both PS and PRR, ground reference experiments were carried out in the ERM-2 at NASA-ARC, using ight build spares and matching environmental parameters to the ight experiments. Briey, this hardware was designed to replicate environmental conditions experienced aboard the ISS to include temperature, gas composition, and provide comparable support to the ight hardware. Experimental containers (ECs) were positioned in the ERM in an upright position such that seedlings grew vertically, with lighting provided within each seed cassette from above the germinating seedlings, similar to the ight con guration. 2.5 RNA isolation All analyzed shoot samples for the 1 gcontrols were from seed cassettes in position 3 of each EC. For PS, position 3 correspondedLand et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 03to 0.76 gand for PRR position 3 corresponded to 1 g (Supplementary Figure 1 ). For each RNA isolation, seed cassettes were processed singly as follows. A single seed cassette was retrievedfrom the freezer, and the cover was removed. The cassette base was placed on a chilled platform, and RNA-later (Thermo Fisher Cat. No. AM7021) was added. The seedlings were dissected into root and shoot fractions and stored at 4C in RNA-later for 24 hours, followed by storage at -20C until RNA isolation. RNA was isolated from each shoot sample using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Applied Biosystems Cat No. AM1931). RNA recovery and integrity were monitored by Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100). For the PRR shoot samples, the RNA isolation protocol was modi ed in order to retain the small RNA fraction as well. 2.6 Illumina sequencing Each sample for Illumina Sequencing consisted of RNA isolated from a single seed cassette (each containing 27 seedlings) and each treatmentcondition consisted of 3-4 replicates each. PS library preparation and sequencing were carried out by the Genomic Sciences Laboratory at North Carol ina State University (Raleigh, NC) as described previously ( Sheppard et al., 2021 ). Libraries were prepared using the ultra-directional library prep kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Sequencing was carried out on 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq2500 (125 bp single end reads). For PRR, Librarypreparation and Illumina sequencing for RNA and small RNA (sRNA) was carried out by Novogene Corporation Inc. (Sacramento, CA). 2.7 Data processing and analysis Raw reads were cleaned up to remove adapters and reads shorter than 50 reads by cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 ). Quality control was evaluated by FastQC ( Andrews, 2010 ) to ensure adapters were removed. Reads were aligned using HiSat2 ( Kim et al., 2019 ) to the Arabidopsis genome using TAIR10 ( Lamesch et al., 2012 ) and Araport11 ( Cheng et al., 2017 ) genome annotations (downloaded 082018). Read counts per feature were generated using HTseq- Count ( Anders et al., 2015 ). Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 ). Features with one count or less in any sample were discarded. Differentially expressed genes were ltered on p-values. For the individual analyses of PS and PRR, the signi cance cutoff was padj 0.05 and for the combined analyses, the cutoff was padj  0.01. Each sample and condition was represented by 3-4 replicates. Normalized DESeq2 counts tables were visualized as heatmaps using the R package pheatmap (version 1.0.12), clustering by column and scaling by row. To determine whether overlap between individually analyzed PS and PRR DE gene lists were signi cant and non-random, BA FIGURE 1 Experimental Timelines of Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR). Seed cassettes were prepared with dry seed and installed into the EMCS hardware on board the ISS. Experiments were initiated by remote hydration (blue arrows), and the two rotors were actuated according to the schedule shown with regular imaging (black arrows). Plant signaling (A)employed a constant light schedule while Plant RNA Regulation (B)was conducted under a 168 hour lightdark schedule, with two staggered hydration events allowing for the simultaneous harvest of 4 day and 6 day oldseedlings at the end of the experiment.Land et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 04hypergeometric distribution hypothesis testing was carried out using the phyper function of the R programming language. These analyses assumed a total genome size of 33,603 genes. Similarly, enrichment for HY5 targets in  gDEG lists obtained from the combined PSPRR dataset was analyzed by the same function, assuming 3,894 putative HY5 binding targets within the genome (Lee et al., 2007 ). To identify potential upstream regulatory sequences present in the DEGs, a 4th order Markov background model was constructed using the 1kb regions of DNA upstream of all genes found to be differentially regulated in  g. Using this model as a background control, MEME analysis ( Bailey et al., 2015 ) examined the 500 bp regions upstream of upregulated genes using the parameters -mod anr -minw 6 -maxw 8 -p 4 -nmotifs 10 -dna -revcomp to elicit enriched motifs. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and enrichment was queried using agriGO2 ( Tian et al., 2017 ), ExPath2.0 ( Tseng et al., 2020 ), PANTHER18.0 ( Thomas et al., 2022 ), and PlantGSAD ( Ma et al., 2022 ). PCA variance analysis was performed using variance stabilized counts from the DESeq dds object in ggplot2; this was limited to the topve hundred transcripts ranked by variance. Data was captured from the plotPCA function using ggplot_build. To determine the signicance of the correlation between the variables of Age and Gravity Condition and the principal components, we used the package PCAtools R package ( Blighe and Lun, 2023 ). The function eigencorplot was used to visualize and test the signicance of the correlation between these two variables and the top six principal components ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). The comparison was made using Pearson s correlation, with pairwise.complete.obs, so that the correlation between each pair is evaluated using all paired data for each variable. The Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction was applied.2.8 Data availability Raw sequence les and metadata for PS and PRR are available at the NASA data repository GeneLab under the accession numbers OSD-223 and OSD-437. 3 Results 3.1 Experimental setup and growth parameters To minimize the impact of handling and transport, seeds were dry- mounted on membranes and remaine d dormant until hydration at the initiation of each experimental run. The dry seed con guration with an on-orbit hydration also eliminated the need for late loading and allowed for exibility in the event of ight scrubbing or delayed experiment initiation. Following hydration and illumination, seedlings from PS and PRR germinated with high frequency (Supplementary Table 1 ) and exhibited nominal growth across each run of both experiments. Differences in experimental design ( Figure 1 ) included the presenceabsence of a daynight cycle, total experiment length, and centrifugal pro les. Notably, PS incorporated 48 hours of initial 1 gt r e a t m e n ta tt h es t a r to ft h ee x p e r i m e n t .F o rt h el a t e r experiment, PRR, the mgrotor remained stationary for the entire duration of the experiment. A morphological difference was observed between these experiments, characterized by a largely uniform orientation of seedling roots in PS, in contrast to the more disordered growth patterns observed in PRR ( Figure 2 ). This difference could be due to the initial gravitational cue provided to all seedlings in PS, the presence of a daynight cycle in PRR, or a combination of the two. Despite a small degree of variation from seed cassette to seed cassette, each experiment provided a suf cient FIGURE 2 Representative Images of Plant Signaling and Plant RNA Regulation Seed Cassettes. Representative images of seedling morphology across  gand 1 gconditions taken at the end of each experiment. Digital JPEGs are displayed directly as downlinked from EMCS hardware without alteration. Note that the camera con guration which allowed for close-up imaging provided two images of each seed cassette (left and right side), with partial overlap of each captured image (scale bar  0.5 cm).Land et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 05amount of healthy plant tissue for downstream analysis, and only those cassettes which exhibited nominal growth and development were selected for downstream analysis ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). 3.2 Differentially expressed genes The individual DE-Seq2 analyses of PS and PRR yielded a signicant number of genes that wer e differentially expressed between microgravity ( mg) and the onboard (1 g) control. In total, we identi ed 1,819 and 1,792 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PS, and PRR, respectively. The overlap between the two experiments for both mgupregulated and mgdownregulated DEG lists was signi cant ( Table 1 ). Both experiments shared 178 genes upregulated in  gand 399 genes downregulated in  g.G O annotation revealed enrichment of the GO terms, Regulation of Transcription and Auxin Signaling in the common  g upregulated genes. Cell Wall and Response to Stress were GO terms enriched in the common  gdownregulated genes. To further compare the two experiments, RNA-Seq reads from PS and PRR were re-analyzed in a combined study to impart increased statistical power. DE-Seq2 analysis of this combined dataset revealed 1,112 genes upregulated in  gand 1,429 genes downregulated in  g (Supplementary Table 2 ). It should be noted that 99 of DEGs identi ed as common to the two individual datasets listed above were similarly identi ed by this combined analysis. Additionally, this analysis further reinforced the enrichment categories initially observed by individual analyses. Table 2 lists the major enriched GO terms for DEGs up- and downregulated in  g. 3.2.1 Genes upregulated in mg, compared to 1 g in space 3.2.1.1 Transcription factors Similar to the individual studies, the combined results for PS and PRR show strong enrichment of genes associated with DNA transcription. In total, 159 Transcription Factors (TFs) as identi ed by Pruneda-Paz et al. ( Pruneda-Paz et al., 2014 ) were upregulated in g(Supplementary Table 3 ). The majority of these TFs are involved in regulating shoot meristem and leaf growth and are associated with organ patterning, leaf development, and photomorphogenesis. Speci cally, SPCH ,WOX3 ,TCP22 ,GATA2 ,HFR1 , several GRFs, as well as TFs mediating auxin responses and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling were upregulated in the mgcondition relative to 1 g controls. The upregulated list also included 8 TFs belonging to the Apetala2Ethylene response factor (AP2ERF) superfamily, of which cytokinin response factors (CRF4 and CRF5) andAintegumenta (ANT) play established roles in cell proliferation and embryo, cotyledon and leaf development ( Mizukami and Fischer, 2000 ;Rashotte et al., 2006 ). 3.2.1.2 Other transcriptional regulators Among the DEGs upregulated in mg, 7 genes with potential epigenetic regulatory function were noted. Of these, 5 genes encoded SET domain containing histone methyltransferases including 3 members of the SUVH family ( Naumann et al., 2005 ). Genome wide methylation changes leading to altered transcriptional pro l e sh a v eb e e nr e p o r t e di nr e s p o n s et o space ight ( Zhou et al., 2019 ;Paul et al., 2021 ). 3.2.1.3 Auxin related genes Another conserved category that was prominent in the combined analysis is auxin transport and signaling ( Table 3 ); this group includes 2 auxin ef ux carriers ( PIN3 andPIN4 ), six auxin response factors ( ARF s), and 11 small auxin upregulated (SAUR ) genes. SAUR s were among the more highly upregulated genes in  g, with 9 of the 11 induced more than 2-fold. SAUR sw e r e rst characterized as rapidly induced in response to auxin, although a fewSAUR s are repressed by auxin ( Ren and Gray, 2015 ). Of the 11 SAUR s identi ed in this dataset, 10 are induced by auxin; SAUR15 and SAUR16 may also be induced by Gibberellic acid (GA) and Brassinosteroids ( Ren and Gray, 2015 ). SAURs 13-16 are classi ed as lirSAURs ( Sun et al., 2016 ) that are light-regulated in cotyledons and hypocotyls and directly interact with phytochrome interacting factors (PIF)s ( Dong et al., 2019 ). Overexpression of SAUR36 and SAUR41 increases cell expansion and promotes hypocotyl elongation ( Chae et al., 2012 ;Stamm and Kumar, 2013 ). SAUR36 is implicated in leaf growth senescence ( Hou et al., 2013 ), and SAUR76 may act as a negative regulator of leaf expansion by regulating cell division ( Markakis et al., 2013 ). SAUR15 is involved in the shade avoidance response and is a potential target of PIF4. Interestingly, SAUR15 expression has been shown to increase on the lower ank of in orescence stems 30 min following gravistimulation ( Taniguchi et al., 2014 ). We also detected 6 ARFs upregulated in  g. In general, ARFs are TFs that are bound by AuxIAA repressors and remain inactive in the absence of auxin. This repression is relieved in the presence of auxin, promoting transcriptional activation of auxin-responsive downstream genes. Three of the ARFs detected in this dataset (ARF1 ,ARF4 and ARF19 ) are implicated in leaf development, while ARF6 and ARF17 play a role in owering ( Cance et al., 2022 ;Li et al., 2023 ).

This category consists of approximately 50 genes, including those encoding for members of the coat protein (COP) complex, Sec2324 protein transport, and several proteinsassociated with Golgi and the endomembrane system ( Hwang and Robinson, 2009 ). The enrichment of vesicle transport is consistent with observation that shoot growth and developmental processes appear to be altered under  g. Not surprisingly, given the enrichment of biological processes described above involving vesicle transport, auxin responses, and transcriptional regulators, the cellular compartmentsTABLE 2 GO enrichment analysis of genes differentially regulated in microgravity.

A consensus sequence, 5 -GGCCCA-3 , was returned as the top result of this query, with an E-value of 3.7E-12 ( Figure 3A ). There were 258 occurrences of this motif in 174 unique genes (15.6 of total input genes). Further, this motif predominantly occurred in the -100 to -0 bp region upstream of transcript initiation sites, as seen in the density analysis ( Figure 3B ). This motif, also known as Up1 (GGCCCAWWW) or Site II element  (TGGGCY), is overrepresented in the -200 to -1 bp region of Arabidopsis transcripts ( Molina and Grotewold, 2005 ;Davis et al., 2012 ). Additionally, this sequence has been identi ed as a binding site of the TB1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF (TCP) plant-speci c family of transcription factors ( Viola et al., 2011 ). Arabidopsis TCP proteins regulate many aspects of development including cell cycle control, leaf morphology, senescence as well as defense responses (Aguilar Martinez and Sinha, 2013 ;Li, 2015 ). Consistent with the enrichment of this element upstream of genes upregulated in  g,a class I TCP ( TCP22 ) was found to be upregulated in  g (Supplementary Table 3 ). 3.2.2 Genes downregulated in  g, compared to 1 gin space The combined analysis of PS and PRR indicated that responses to stress (both abiotic and biotic) were highly enriched in genes downregulated in  g(Table 2 ), consistent with what was observed in each individual experiment. This overall dampening of stress response genes includes a downregulation of genes encoding several members of Cytochrome P450 family, 14 Glutathione S- transferases, and members of a MATE ef ux family involved indetoxi cation. In addition, we detected an enrichment of plastid- associated genes as well as several involved in cell wall organization. 3.2.2.1 Transcription factors The  gdownregulated DEGs include 120 TFs ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Unlike the upregulated TFs, which were associated with developmental responses, the downregulated TFs are primarily involved in regulating stress responses ( Figure 4 ). The downregulated TFs include those implicated in biotic stress and plant defense ( Ng et al., 2018 ) and those involved in abiotic stresses, including osmotic and temperature stress. As is illustrated in Figure 4 , the functions of these downregulated TFs are distinct with limited overlap with those of the upregulated TFs. While 4-5 GO terms show some overlap, these categories are most signi cant in the downregulated TFs. Further analysis within the overlapping categories show for instance that the auxin and ABA related terms in the upregulated TF group are involved with growth while the downregulated TF genes in these groups contain those that regulate stress as described below. The largest groups of TF downregulated in  gare 15 ethylene response factors (ERF)s and 12 WRKY TFs ( Phukan et al., 2016 ). The WRKY TFs in our dataset appear to function chie y in abiotic or biotic stress responses. The ERFs include 7 dehydration responsive element-bindin g( D R E B )s u b f a m i l yAm e m b e r s including CBF2, ( Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2000 ; Novillo et al., 2004 ) and 8 AP2ERF family TFs ( Srivastava and Kumar, 2019 ). The downregulated TF list also includes 4 heat stress TFs, several MYB and NAC family TFs, and calmodulin binding transcriptional activators (CAMTA)s. 3.2.2.2 Biotic stress and defense related genes Among the genes downregulated in  g, approximately 200 genes were associated with plant defense and response to biotic stimuli. This category includes 2 4 disease-resistance proteins, different classes of receptor-like protein kinases, and several WRKY TFs. Of interest, it has been reported that WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60 (which are represented in our dataset) B A FIGURE 3 Consensus Sequence and Distribution of the Site II Element Enriched in Promoter Regions of Upregulated Transcripts. (A)Sequence analysis of the 500 bp region upstream of  gupregulated transcripts showed an enrichment for the motif identi ed as the Site II element. (B)Density analysis of the distribution of this motif within the analyzed region indicates a probability density maxima at -70bp relative to transcriptional start sites (r ight). The position of individual occurrences of this motif within the analyzed regions is plotted along the x-axis (blue dots), visualized with an arti cial spread across the y-axis.Land et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 09form a cluster that work either synergistically or antagonistically in response to bacterial or necrotrophic pathogens ( Xu et al., 2006 ; Schn et al., 2013 ). 3.2.2.3 Abiotic stress related genes In addition to the downregulation of genes involved in biotic stress responses, we also detected approximately 140 downregulated genes associated with the responses to temperature stimulus and ABA-mediated regulation of osmotic stress ( Supplementary Table 5 ). Song et al. carried out a time series of RNA-Seq experiments and large-scale ChIP-Seq focused on 21 ABA- responsive TFs ( Song et al., 2016 ). This study revealed a TF hierarchical network regulating ABA responses in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, 9 of these 21 TFs (namely, NFY-B2 ,NFY-C2 ,GBF3 , MYB44 ,DIV2 ,HB7 ,NAC032 ,NAC102 and RD26 )a r e downregulated in our dataset. 3.2.2.4 Calcium signaling related genes Given the enhancement in stress responses, it is not surprising that approximately 40 genes involved in calcium signaling weredownregulated in  g(Table 4 ). This category includes calcium binding proteins, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK)s, calmodulin-binding proteins an d TFs, CBL-interacting protein kinases, and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels (CNGC)s. 3.2.3 Non-coding RNAs Natural antisense transcripts (NAT)s are antisense sequences which may overlap in part with protein coding (sense) transcripts. This sense-antisense pairing can lead to regulation of the sensetranscript ( Wight and Werner, 2013 ). A negative correlation in expression (i.e. NAT up and sense transcript down) may be indicative of gene silencing; however, NATs may also enhance sense transcript expression by regulating mRNA stability andor translation ( Reis and Poirier, 2021 ). Among the DEGs in  g, we found 42 upregulated NATs and 30 downregulated NATs. Interestingly, we observe a negative correlation between NAT expression and the overlapping sense transcripts for 29 of the 42 upregulated NATs suggesting a possible means of repression of these genes. Among these are several genes encoding for chloroplastic proteins, defense related FIGURE 4 Functional comparison of transcription factors differentially expressed in microgravity.

Additionally, we observed that the expression of 20 of the overlapping sense transcript s for the 30 downregulated NATs are upregulated under  g(Supplementary Table 6 ). 3.3 Microgravity versus the space environment Perhaps the most striking aspect of the DEGs that are downregulated in both PS and PRR is that  400 genes are associated with stress responses. This included a strong enrichment of biotic stress response (in particular, response to bacteria and chitin) and genes known to respond to many abiotic stresses, including salt and temperature. Curiously, these responses have been reported as upregulated in space ight experiments compared to ground controls. It is not surprising that the space environment poses several challenges to plants and many of these are not easy to measure or replicate on the ground. Although our focus in both PS and PRR space ights was the direct comparison of gwith the onboard 1 gcontrol, we also carried out ground controls where EMCS chamber conditions were matched in the ground reference module ERM-2. An examination of the DEGs between 1 gin space and ground controls revealed that many of these stress response-related genes were actually upregulated in 1 gcompared to the ground. These observations indicate that the space environment (excluding  g) enhanced the expression of these stress-related genes. However, this group of genes was speci cally downregulated in  gcompared to 1 gsuggesting that microgravity masks the induction of these genes in the space environment. Representative heat maps for select defense-related genes are shown in Figure 5 (Supplementary Table 7 ). As an example of an abiotic stress response, heat maps for a set of genes involved in salt stress are shown in Figure 6 (Supplementary Table 8 ). These heat maps clearly illustrate that the stress-related genes showed higher levels of expression in the space ight 1 gcondition compared to either  gor the ground controls. Since the 1 gand  gexperiments were conducted on two rotors held in the same chamber at the same time, we can be con dent that all other space-related stimuli were shared between the two, and that the primary difference between them was the  gtreatment. The differences between 1 gand the ground control samples, would include all other effects of the space environment, excluding microgravity. It is clear that many of these genes would not have been detected as differentially expressed in the absence of the on board 1 gcontrol and these results reveal that this control is critical in order to identify  gspecic changes. 3.3.1 Micro RNAs detected and their target genes In addition to mRNA pro ling, the PRR space ight experiment included sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA)s which revealed that FIGURE 5 Expression pro les of DEG subsets across 1 g,g, and ground control conditions. DESeq2 normalized counts (two replicates for each condition) of defense DEG subsets were visualized as heatmaps by the R package pheatmap. Data presented are clustered by column (dendrogram, top), andscaled by row.Land et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 12several micro RNAs (miRNA)s were differentially regulated in  g compared to 1 gand ground controls. miRNAs act to regulate gene expression either by the cleavage of their target mRNAs, or by repression of translation or DNA methylation ( Song et al., 2019 ). We identi ed 3 miRNAs miR319c, miR863-5p and miR398b- 3pthat were upregulated in  g(Figure 7A ). Both miR863 and miR398b are found in Arabidopsis leaves and seedlings ( Meng et al., 2012 ). The miR398 family was shown to target Cuand Zn dismutase enzymes in response to Cudeciency ( Yamasaki et al., 2007 ) and the miR319 family is involved in the regulation of leaf shape via their interaction with TCP TFs ( Bresso et al., 2018 ). Although the speci c targets listed in these publications were not represented in our dataset, we did detect several putative miRNA targets. Correlation analysis of miR319c and miR863-5p and their predicted mRNA targets detected in our dataset are shown in Figure 7B (Supplementary Table 9 ). It can be seen that many of the predicted targets were coordinately downregulated in  g, consistent with repression by these miRNAs. The miR319c cluster of downregulated targets include several defense-related genes and 12 of the 22 miR398b-3p target genes encode for chloroplastic enzymes and proteins. Interestingly, overall 38 of the downregulated miR319c, miR863-5p and miR398b-3p target gene products are localized in the plastid. Two miRNAs, miR156f-3p and miR5654-3p were upregulated in 1grelative to  g(Figure 7A ) with coordinate down regulation of14-16 of their predicted targets in 1 g(Supplementary Table 9 ). The miR156 family is closely associated with and regulates several Squamosa Promoter binding Like (SPL) TFs and is important for regulating phase transitions such as the progression from juvenile to adult stages and owering time ( Wang and Wang, 2015 ). Most recently, miR156 has been shown to modulate seedling growth in response to temperature and light changes via its interaction with SPL9 ( Sang et al., 2023 ). Coincidentally, SPL9 expression is downregulated in 1 gin our dataset along with other targets of miR156f-3p, which are related to auxin and ethylene signaling. We also observed that both  gand 1 gseedlings had higher expression of miR398b-3p compared to ground control and 4 miR398b-3p target genes were co ordinately downregulated in both  gand 1 gcompared with ground, including two TFs, GTE11 andATRX-like-protein . 3.3.2 Day 4 versus day 6: a possible interaction between  gresponses and development The experimental design of PRR with staggered hydration allowed for some samples to be initiated 48h later, yielding two time points (Day 4 and Day 6) from the same experiment. Our major focus was on DEGs detected at Day 6, described in the preceding sections. Comparing the effects of microgravity on the Day 4 and Day 6 plants revealed i nteractions between plant developmental stage and microgr avity. These interactions are FIGURE 6 Expression pro les of DEG subsets across 1 g,g, and ground control conditions. DESeq2 normalized counts (two replicates for each condition) of salt stress DEG subsets were visualized as heatmaps by the R package pheatmap. Data presented are clustered by column (dendrogram, top), and scaled by row.Land et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 13apparent in the PCA plot of the PRR Day 4 and 6 ight samples (Figure 8A ). Principal component 1 primarily separated Day 4 and Day 6 samples under 1 g(p0.05). Principal component 2 separated 1gand  gat either day (p0.001). However, there was little separation between the Day 4 and Day 6 samples in  gin the rst principal component ( Figure 8A ). Examination of the DEGs at Day 4 revealed that a much smaller fraction of genes were differentially regulated in  gat Day 4 (compared with the DEGs detected at Day 6). In total, at Day 4 there were 406 DEGs (75 up and 331 down in  gcompared to 1 g). Many of these DEGs ( 40 of the up- and 60 of downregulated genes in  g) at Day 4 were shared with the Day 6 data. A majority of the 210 genes commonly downregulated in  gat both Day 4 and Day 6, were related to abiotic and biotic stresses as described previously. This nding indicates that  gspecic downregulation of stress responses occurs as early as Day 4 and is common between the two times sampled. Genes associated with cell wall organization were also found to be downregulated at both days. Examples of genes which exhibit similar downregulation in microgravity at both Day 4 and 6 are depicted in Figure 8B . We also observed that several gene s were uniquely downregulated in gat Day 4 only. Scatter plots of representative genes in this group clearly indicate that the differential expression observed at Day 4 did not persist at Day 6 ( Figure 8C ). Taken together, these results suggest that the developmental window the samples are in could in uence the observed transcription response pro les and point to interactions between gand the developmental stage.4 Discussion 4.1 Conserved and unique transcriptional changes in microgravity The PS and PRR space ight experiments were designed to examine early seedling development and responses to microgravity. To answer these questions, we utilized the EMCS facility with a rotor con guration selected to provide  gand an onboard 1 gcontrol. The two experiments were conducted at different times and had different lighting regimes as well as some other differences in set up as outlined in Figure 1 . Despite these differences, there was considerable parity between the DEGs in  g between the two experiments. Genes upregulated in  gcompared to the 1 gcontrol were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development. The majority of the upregulated TFs function to regulate these processes and the enrichment in auxin and vesicle transport also support growth processes. In contrast, there appears to be a substantial downregulation of both biotic and abiotic stress responses in  g. Defense related genes were overrepresented and most of the downregulated TFs function in mediating plant stress responses ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, we identi ed speci c miRNAs that were differentially regulated in microgravity with coordinate regulation of their putative targets. The large-scale downregulation in microgravity of stress- response related genes in the PS and PRR ight experiments are somewhat at odds with other experiments where ight responses BA FIGURE 7 Differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes.

Squares denote the miRNAs and circles represent the miRNA target genes.Red and green represent up and down regulation, respectively.Land et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 14are compared to a ground control on Earth. In fact, we nd that genes reported as upregulated in space ight appear to be downregulated in our datasets. For instance, 70 genes that were upregulated in space ight in BRIC19 ( Choi et al., 2019 )a r e downregulated in  gin our dataset. Many of these common genes are associated with response to stress and hypoxia. We do however nd more overlap in responses if we examine RNA-Seq datasets from other EMCS space ight experiments which utilized onboard 1 gcontrols. The Seedling Growth experiments (SG2 and SG3) were conducted in the EMCS; however these experiments included photostimulation with either unidirectional blue ( Herranz et al., 2019 ;Vandenbrink et al., 2019 )o rr e d (Villacampa et al., 2021 ) light for the nal 48h of the experimental timeline. Although there was almost no overlap in DEGs upregulated in  g; we do detect considerable overlap with  gdownregulated genes as well as genes downregulated in low (0.1) g (Herranz et al., 2019 ). Comparing our results to Herranz et al. shows that 54 genes were commonly downregulated in  g. Furthermore, 143 genes downregulated in low gwere shared with genes downregulated in  gin our data. Even more pronounced is the similarity in enriched GO terms for genes downregulated in  g and low gcompared to 1 g(Herranz et al., 2019 ) and the genes downregulated in  gin the PSPRR data. These include, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stimulus and response to stress. Genes downregulated in  gin with the red light photostimulation (Villacampa et al., 2021 )w e r ee n r i c h e di nt h eG Oc a t e g o r i e s response to bacterium and fungus. Taken together these results further reinforce the idea that both biotic and abiotic stress responses appear to be speci cally downregulated in  g.T h i s regulation would not have been detected without the onboard 1 g B CA FIGURE 8 Comparison of Expression Pro les at Day 4 and Day 6.

DESeq2 normalized counts were visualized using ggplot2.Land et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 15condition for comparison and these results point to the value of having an onboard 1 gcontrol. At least 4 different Arabidopsis ecotypes have been own in space including Col-0, Ler, Ws and Cvi ( Paul et al., 2017 ;Choi et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, the Col-0 ecotype was found to be more responsive to the space ight environment compared to both Ws and Ler with more DEGs detected overall. A direct comparison of our results (on light grown Col-0 shoots) with the previous studies is hampered by the fact that they utilized either root tips or etiolated whole seedlings. Nevertheless, when we compare our ndings with other space ight experiments, we nd that two common features stand out; many experiments have reported altered expression of genes involved in cell wall modi cation and photosynthesisplastid related genes. Two unexpected ndings of our experiments are the potential regulation by the transcription factor Elongated Hypocotyl 5(HY5) and the altered expression of a few gravitropism related genes. 4.1.1 Cell wall related genes Genes involved in remodeling of plant cell walls have been reported to be differentially expressed in previous space ight experiments ( Paul et al., 2013 ;Kwon et al., 2015 ;Johnson et al., 2017 ;Choi et al., 2019 ;Nakashima et al., 2023 ). Glycomic analysis of space ight plant samples have shown changes in cell wall glycans, consistent with space ight related modi cation of cell walls (Johnson et al., 2017 ;Nakashima et al., 2023 ). Similar to these previous reports, we also observed that genes involved in cell wall modi cation are overrepresented in our datasets; particularly we found approximately 100 genes associated with cell wall organization and modi cation downregulated in  g.T h e s e included genes encoding for several members of the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH) family, expansins, peroxidases, pectin esterases and polygalacturonases. These cell wall proteins are involved in cell wall polymer rearrangement which occurs during cell elongation ( Irshad et al., 2008 ). The individual genes in these enzyme categories however, we re not conserved between our dataset and the previous reports; probably due to differences in tissue type, age and growth conditions. We also found cellulose synthase-like genes and 6 genes encoding for dirigent proteins which are involved in lignin biosynthesis to be downregulated in g. 4.1.2 Chloroplast and photosynthesis related genes The mis-regulation or altered regulation of photosynthesis related genes has been reported for many space ight experiments including those that focused on seedlings grown in the dark ( Kwon et al., 2015 ;Kruse et al., 2020 ). The investigators who conducted the EMCS experiments SG2 and SG3, (Vandenbrink et al., Herranzet al., and Villacampa et al.) reported that genes involved in photosynthesis were enriched in both  gupregulated and  g downregulated datasets. We did not detect photosynthesis related genes upregulated in  gin either PS or PRR, perhaps due to the differences in the lighting regime compared with the SG series of experiments. However, we do see enrichment for genes involved inphotosynthesis and plastid function downregulated in  g. Plastid localization was an enriched GO term for cellular localization accounting for approximately 300 genes in the  gdownregulated category of our dataset. Genes encoding for subunits of the NADPH complex, LHCA and photosystem I and II core were downregulated in  gin both PS and PRR. We also found that several of the  g downregulated miRNA targets were associated with plastids. Since many of these space ight studies have focused on young Arabidopsis seedlings, it is not clear if the altered regulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function would persist in fully grown plants. Whether such adjustments continue to maturity and how they may impact the photosynthetic capacity of plants will need to be evaluated in future space ight experiments. 4.1.3 HY5 target genes Genes differentially expressed in  gin both PS and PRR were signicantly enriched for HY5 target genes. HY5 is a central regulator of photomorphogenesis and may directly or indirectlyaffect the expression of approximately one third of the Arabidopsis genome ( Lee et al., 2007 ;Gangappa and Botto, 2016 ). HY5 is involved in integrating light and hormonal signals to regulate developmental processes in plants. In addition to a major role in light mediated signaling, HY5 is implicated in nutrient uptake and utilization, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and response to uctuations in temperature ( Xiao et al., 2021 ). HY5 targets were signi cantly enriched in the genes upregulated in  g (hypergeometric test, p2.45e-11). The  gupregulated HY5 targets were associated with organ development, light responses and auxin transport. We also found a signi cant enrichment of HY5 targets in the genes downregulated in  g(hypergeometric test, p1.698e-120). Many of the downregulated HY5 targets were involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses. 4.1.4 Gravitropism related genes Curiously, we found some gravitropism related genes to be upregulated in  g. Among these, the TF Shoot Gravitropism 5 (SGR5 ) was upregulated in  gat both Day 4 and Day 6. SGR5 was rst described as being important for the gravitropic response of Arabidopsis in orescence stems ( Yamauchi et al., 1997 ). Further studies showed that SGR5 is localized in the shoot endodermis and that amyloplast sedimentation in the shoot endodermis is slower in thesgr5mutant ( Morita et al., 2006 ;Tanimoto et al., 2008 ). SGR5 is also known as Indeterminate Domain 15 (IDD15). The IDD TFs IDD14, IDD15 and IDD16 have been shown to work cooperatively to regulate auxin transport in the shoot and play a role in aerial tissue development and gravitropic responses ( Cui et al., 2013 ). We found IDD14 to be upregulated in  g, as well as another gene involved in regulating gravitropic response LAZY1 .LAZY1 is expressed primarily in shoots of young seedlings and the early stages of the hypocotyl gravitropism were affected in a lazy1 mutant (Yoshihara and Spalding, 2017 ). The LAZY proteins are thought to act early in the gravity signaling cascade by transmitting positional information on amyloplast sedimentation upstream of auxin redistribution ( Nishimura et al., 2023 ). The upregulation of theseLand et al. 10.3389fpls.2023.1308713 Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org 16genes under  gmaybe related to their roles in regulating auxin ow; a closer look at their localization and dynamics under microgravity would be informative. 4.2 The In uence of developmental stage on observed transcriptional responses The differences in gene expression between  gand 1 gat Day 4 and Day 6 in PRR, revealed that many more genes were responsive to gat Day 6 than at Day 4. Since the Day 4 and Day 6 samples for each condition were obtained from the same rotor and collected at the same time, these differences suggest that the developmental stage of the seedlings can have a profound effect on observed transcriptional responses. The variation between Day 4 and Day 6 samples grown in 1 gand  g, was also evident in the PCA plot where principal component 1, (which captured 53 of the variation between samples), clearly separated the Day 4 and Day 6 samples at 1g; however, this separation was not observed in samples grown under the  gcondition. This indicates that differences in gene expression between the Day 4 and Day 6 samples in 1 gare either masked or not present in  g. A possible explanation for this observation is that there are differences between 1 gand  g grown seedlings in their developmental progression. To determine if there were delays in germination between 1 g and  gthat could result in altered development we examined germination time by interrogating the sequential series of images obtained throughout the PRR experiment. We found no difference in the timing of the rst occurrence of radicle emergence between  gand 1 gseedlings. We conclude that there was no delay in germination under  g; additionally, growth at Day 6 ( Figure 3 ) was similar between  gand 1 gconditions. Although we did not see gross differences in growth, given the short timeframe of this experiment, we cannot rule out that there may be subtle changeswhich could become more pronounced as the plants mature. Longer duration experiments with a ner resolution of time points would be required to fully characterize and understand the regulatory underpinnings for these differences. 4.3 Lessons learned for future space ight experiments 4.3.1 Long term plant experiments The PS and PRR experiments were focused on a narrow window of the Arabidopsis life cycle; the TROPI seed cassettes and ECarrangement only supported short duration experiments. Therefore we cannot extrapolate or assume that the transcriptional response to microgravity seen in these experiments would be universally applicable to long duration plant experiments on the ISS. Furthermore the seed cassettes provide a controlled optimal environment for seedling growth with suf cient lighting, moisture and humidity without inherent space ight associated limitations of water delivery that are manifest in larger plant growth habitats. Long term experiments where plants are grown from seed to maturity are needed to characterize critical stages in plantdevelopment. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of plant adaptations to the space environment. 4.3.2 Multiple bioreplicates Both PS and PRR included two experimental runs or bioreplicates. Although the replicates for each space ight were carried out back to back in the same hardware, and from the same ight builds, we detected run to run variation in responses. Run to run variation may be caused by other space ight related conditions that could differ on a day to day basis on the ISS. While this disparity did not overshadow the major transcriptional changes that were conserved between the PS and PRR experiments, it could be misleading if results from only a single experiment are considered. This underscores the importance of being able to conduct replicate space ight experiments. 4.3.3 Combined OMIC approaches We acknowledge that single-time-point studies are snapshots of steady-state transcriptional pro les which, on their own, are not sufcient to capture the full range and continuum of regulation. However, single-time-point transcriptional studies are valuable in that they can help identify key transcriptional regulators and they offer the rst signs of pathways which may be altered. The inclusion of sRNA pro ling in combination with RNA-Seq can provide clues on an additional layer of post transcriptional regulation and upcoming space ight experiments are likely to incorporate both these forms of analyses. While the proteome may be a more direct readout of response, space ight experiments frequently have insufcient amounts of tissue for large scale proteomic studies; additional hurdles include the cost and the paucity of well annotated reference protein databases. Only a few ight experiments to date, have taken a proteomic approach ( Ferl et al., 2014 ;Mazars et al., 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2015 ;Kruse et al., 2020 ), and fewer still have been able to include both proteomic and transcriptomic analyses ( Kruse et al., 2020 ). Moving forward it will be important to employ multiple OMICs approaches to study a space ight experiment. The larger plant habitats on the ISS such as Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) can better support these endeavors. Ultimately, the biochemical and metabolic status of the plants will be indicative of their adaptations to their new environment.

        "introduction": ": Understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several space ight experiments have focused on transcriptional proling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difcult to nd a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other space ight effects.",
