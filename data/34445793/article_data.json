Abstract: Spaceight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body uids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceight. Mice were exposed to spaceight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting 3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceight. Spaceight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) , upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2 , suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycleapoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the inammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53 . Spaceight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.

Introduction Responses to spaceight include cardiovascular decits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes  13. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body uids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a uid shift between the vasculature and interstitium  46. The uid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms  6. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts 7. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning  8, despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy  9,10. A reduction in myocardial interstitial uid may contribute to lower myocardial mass Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088. https:doi.org10.3390ijms22169088 https:www.mdpi.comjournalijmsInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 2 of 16 following microgravity exposure  11. In rodents, 14 days of spaceight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy  12. In contrast, spaceight for one week did not affect cardiac mass  13, although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies  14,15, but not in others  13, thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction  1618. In fact, spaceight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals  1927. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes  28,29 including CDKN1A (also known as P21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1AP21 is a negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceight elevates Cdkn1a expression in bone tissue  30, liver and kidney  31 as well as cultured cells  29, implicating activation of CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment. We hypothesized that spaceight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycleapoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used the- matic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycleapoptosis ( Trp53 ) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression ndings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration spaceight. 2. Results 2.1. Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight Immediately after landing, all ight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were deter- mined to be in good condition by veterinary examination. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the experiment design and workow. The average weight loss of FLT mice over the duration of the experiment was 2.0 g ( 9.1, SD  2.1 g, p 0.013) whereas GRD control mice lost an average of 0.7 g ( 3.4, SD  0.9 g, p 0.096); the difference in body weight loss averages for FLT versus GRD was not signicant ( p 0.143). FLT habitats showed an average of 10 less food remaining, and 24 less water remaining than GRD habitats. However, measured values for food and water utilization after ight may not precisely reect actual consumption by mice due to possible differences in food breakdown and water spillage in FLT versus GRD habitats. 2.2. Spaceight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes Comparable quantities (average of 38.5 g RNA per tissue sample) and high qualities of total RNA were obtained from all the FLT and GRD samples. To determine if spaceight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance in cardiac tissue, oxidative stress PCR array was performed on 84 genes related to oxidative metabolism (Supplementary Table S1), and this data set was supplemented with real time PCR analysis of Nfe2l2Int.

Gene expression levels of FLT and GRD controls showed a trend towards upregulation of a majority of those genes which were altered by spaceight (Table 1).

There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes related to oxygen transport (Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, there was a 2.4-fold reduction in expression of the global transcription factor, Nfe2l2 , in FLT compared to GRD animals (Figure 2). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regulated as a consequence of exposure to the spaceight environment. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 , 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17 Figure 2.

Statistically significant by MannWhitney U test at p  0.05, n  4. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from the Ground Control and Flight groups were used in the MannWhitney U test. Specifically, there was a marked 6.6-fold upregulation in expression of NADPH oxi- dase 1 ( Nox1 ), suggesting an increase in production of superoxide andor hydrogen per- oxide. Additionally, expression of Prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 ( Ptgs2 ), which acts as peroxidase, was downregula ted by 3.4-fold. The upregulation of Nox1 and downregulation of Ptgs2 may reflect elevated oxidative stress within heart tissue of FLT mice relative to GRD controls. In addition, Txnip was upregulated by 1.9-fold and Fancc was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT samples. Ncf2 , which codes for a component of the NADPH oxidase complex that generates supe roxide, was moderately downregulated by spaceflight ( 1.5-fold). Other antioxidant genes ( Sod1 , Cat, Prdx6 , Gsr, Tpo, Txnrd3 , Slc41a3 ) and oxidative stress-responsive genes ( Xpa, Prnp ) were moderately affected by spaceflight (1.2-2.4 fold, p  0.05) (Table 1). There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes related to oxygen transport (Supplementary Ta ble S1). In contrast, there was a 2.4-fold reduction in expression of the global transcription factor, Nfe2l2 , in FLT compared to GRD animals (Figure 2). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regu- lated as a consequence of exposure to the spaceflight environment. 2.3. Spaceflight Altered Expression of Cell CyclePr oliferation Related Genes The expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduc- tion were analyzed by p53 Signaling Pathway PCR array (S upplementary Table S2). Out of 84 genes, 13 genes were upregulated an d 10 genes were downregulated in FLT com- pared to GRD controls (Table 2, p  0.05). Results show that genes related to cell cycle regulation were altered due to spaceflight. Specifically, cell cycle inhibitors such as Cdkn1a were upregulated 6.8-fold while Cdk1 was downregulated 4.1 -fold, suggesting dimin- ished growth and proliferation signals in FLT samples compared to GRD. Myc was up- regulated 3.9-fold ( p  0.05). Genes involved in inflammatory responses, including Tnf, Tnfrsf10b (Tnf receptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1 , were downregula ted (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease, respectively) in spaceflight samples. Out of the 14 genes analyzed for DNA damage repair, four genes were modestly upregulated ( Atr, Xrcc5 , Ercc1 , Apex1 ; 1.11.3-fold) (Table 2, p  0.05). There were no significant changes in apoptosis-related genes including Trp53 , Bax, Bcl2, Casp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2). Figure 2.

Spaceight Altered Expression of Cell CycleProliferation Related Genes The expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduction were analyzed by p53Signaling Pathway PCR array (Supplementary Table S2). Out of 84 genes, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes were downregulated in FLT compared to GRD controls (Table 2, p 0.05). Results show that genes related to cell cycle regulation were altered due to spaceight. Specically, cell cycle inhibitors such as Cdkn1a were up- regulated 6.8-fold while Cdk1 was downregulated 4.1-fold, suggesting diminished growth and proliferation signals in FLT samples compared to GRD. Myc was upregulated 3.9-fold (p 0.05 ). Genes involved in inammatory responses, including Tnf,Tnfrsf10b (Tnf receptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1 , were downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease, respectively) in spaceight samples. Out of the 14 genes analyzed for DNA damage repair, four genes were modestly upregulated ( Atr,Xrcc5 ,Ercc1 ,Apex1 ; 1.11.3-fold) (Table 2, p 0.05) . There were no signicant changes in apoptosis-related genes including Trp53 , Bax,Bcl2,Casp2 orCasp9 (Supplementary Table S2). 2.4. Gene Networks and Disease Predictions We made use of a computational approach to gain insight into possible proteinprotein interactions among the differentially expressed genes. Analysis using String Db revealed potential interactions between the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways (Figure 3) . A number of oxidative stress response DEGs formed a molecular interaction network including Nox1 and Sod1 with Catalase serving as a central node. DEGs from the Trp53 signaling pathway also formed molecular interaction networks involving cell cycle-related genes and transcription factors. For the Trp53 pathway, Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdkn1a and Atrserved as central nodes in a molecular network that included Chek2 ,Fancc ,Ercc1 ,Xrcc5 and Xpa1 among others. Interestingly, the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways were linked by central nodes FoxO3 ,Jun,Myc, and Hif1a , all of which code for major transcriptionalInt. J. Mol.

Discussion Our ndings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level to the novel environment of space. Spaceight experiments using rodents present unique practical challenges though similar benets to rodent studies on Earth. The animals own in space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary ex- amination after return to Earth, and the nding that animal body weights were comparable in FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous scientic reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ systems (e.g.,  30,32,33). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and of high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission were valid.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 7 of 16 Whereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of cardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited 12,13,3436 .Goldstein et al. 12 re- port that spaceight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle  34. More recently, long duration spaceight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation- related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure of Drosophila to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dys- function, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities  36. Furthermore, spaceight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression prole consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle  37. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel ndings on how the heart responds to spaceight at the tissue level. 3.1. Oxidative Stress-Related Gene Expression in Spaceight Heart RT-PCR array data show that expression levels of 14 genes were signicantly (p 0.05) altered (11 upregulated and 3 downregulated) in FLT samples as compared to GRD controls. In addition, RT-PCR analysis for Nfe2l2 revealed lower levels in FLT mice than GRD. Nfe2l2 is a master transcriptional regulator for oxidative stress response genes, and is rapidly transcribed within seconds following changes in the gravity vector  23. Other tissues also display reduced Nfe2l2 expression levels in similar spaceight experiments entailing tissue recovery after landing  38. Suzuki et al. recently demonstrated that long duration spaceight activates Nfe2l2 -dependent oxidative stress pathways in several tissues of growing mice  39. Furthermore, Nfe2l2 -decient mice are protected from spaceight- induced oxidative stress-related genes and changes in body weight  39, and also display accelerated transition of muscle ber type without protecting from atrophy 40. We also found that spaceight upregulated Nox1 6.6-fold, the change of greatest magnitude in oxidative stress-related genes observed in our study. NOX1 belongs to the NADPH oxidase family of enzymes and functions in generating ROS in a highly regulated fashion  41,42. NOX1 utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and catalyzes transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Superoxide radicals are short lived and are readily converted into hydrogen peroxide. Thus, increased expression of Nox1 can cause an increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS)  41,42. NADPH oxidases are major sources of ROS in the vascular system and are involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction  43. Several recent studies using ground-based models to simulate weightlessness show that hindlimb unloading causes cardiac atrophy, reduces cardiomyocyte size and cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by fractional shortening  14. Inhibition of NOX1 by apocynin (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor) reduces oxidative stress markers in the heart, and mitigates atrophy and dysfunction in hindlimb unloaded mice, suggesting that Nox1 plays an important role in mediating cardiac responses to simulated weightlessness  44. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that increased expression of Nox1 during spaceight contributes to oxidative stress and myocardial abnormalities. Oxidative stress PCR array results showed lower expression of Ptgs2 by 3.4-fold in FLT samples compared to GRD. PTGS2, also known as Cycloxygenase 2 (COX2), is the key, inducible enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts as both a dioxygenase and as a peroxidase, converting hydrogen peroxide into water. Thus, lower Ptgs2 expression can lead to inefcient removal of hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage. PTGS2 is important for the maintenance of healthy cardiac tissue. Conditional cardiomyocyte-specic deletion of the Ptgs2 gene in adult mice reduces cardiac output, decreases exercise tolerance and increases susceptibility to induced ventricular arrhyth-Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 8 of 16 mias  45. Furthermore, human and animal models of myocardial diseases show that Ptgs2 expression is associated with cardiac tissue damaged by infarction, septicemia and inammatory heart diseases  46. In addition to inammation, the prostaglandin pathway plays an important role in mechanical signaling. In cultured cells activated by serum, space- ight prevents induction of Ptgs2 expression, which is avoided by on-orbit centrifugation to replace the gravity vector, implicating sensitivity to a biomechanical mechanism for microgravity-induced activation of the prostaglandin pathway  47. Inhibition of PTGS2 also impairs recovery of skeletal muscle and bone from hindlimb unloading  48,49. Thus, regulation of the prostaglandin pathway by spaceight via changes in Ptgs2 expression may contribute to both oxidative stress and subsequent recovery on Earth. Txnip was upregulated 1.9-fold and Fancc was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT com- pared to GRD, which also may contribute to a pro-oxidative milieu in the heart during spaceight. TXNIP is a negative regulator of thioredoxins (TRXs)  50, which are potent antioxidants, and their downregulation by elevated Txnip expression in FLT samples may lead to increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC), Txnip was the most upregulated by spaceight (33-fold)  51.Fancc codes for an antioxidant and its downregulation can cause sensitivity to oxidative stress-mediated damage to tissue 52. Our results indicated moderate changes in several antioxidant genes ( Sod1 ,Cat,Prdx6 , Gsr,Tpo,Txnrd3 ,Slc41a3 ) and other oxidative stress-responsive genes ( Xpa,Prnp ) (1.22.4-fold, p 0.05) (Table 1). The observed elevated expression levels of these antioxidant genes may be due to activation of compensatory mechanisms. Although the magnitude of differences between FLT and GRD for statistically signi- cant genes were generally modest, together, the ndings suggest that spaceight activates a network of genes responsible for redox signaling and defense against oxidative stress in the heart. 3.2. Cell Cycle and Senescence-Related Gene Expression in Spaceight Heart Increased generation of ROS during spaceight can lead to protein, lipid and DNA damage in tissue and, as is the case with skeletal muscle, may contribute to dysfunction caused by gravitational unloading. ROS are also involved in vital cell signaling pathways such as cell-cycle progression, differentiation, inammation and apoptosis. Cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is regulated at various checkpoints by the action of specic cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The activities of these CDKs are controlled by the positive regulation from cyclins and negative regulation from cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Hence, expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, inammation, DNA damage repair and apoptosis were further analyzed in hearts by p53Signaling PCR array. The p53Signaling PCR array includes 24 genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Results indicate that nine of these genes were signicantly altered in FLT samples. We found spaceight increased Cdkn1a p21 expression 6.8-fold in hearts compared to GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and mus- cle 27,30,31.CDKN1A (also known as P21), is a potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4. Increases inp21levels in bone from mice in this spaceight experiment spaceight were previously associated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors  30. However, the adult mammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adult p21levels in adult heart are thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and there is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart  53, though it is unlikely that such a small sub-population (1.3 of total)  53 can account for our ndings. More likely, the elevation in p21caused by spaceight may contribute to car- diomyopathies 54 via other cellular processes such as DNA repair, autophagy 38,55,56 and senescence. Interestingly, Myc, a mitogenic transcription factor gene that promotes cardiac hypertrophy in response to Angiotensin II, was also highly upregulated in the spaceight heart samples we studied, and its deleterious action can be rescued by p21Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 9 of 16 re-expression in p21-null mice  57. Finally, in newborn mammals, p21elevation might interfere with cardiomyocyte binucleation, an important heart growth mechanism during post-natal development 58. PTTG1 (Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1) regulates the cell cycle by inducing cyclin D3 and repressing p21expression  59. Thus, a decrease in Pttg1 expression (2.4-fold) observed in FLT samples may contribute to the observed increase in expression of p21in FLT samples. In addition to upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, CDKs and cyclins such as Cdk1 and Cdk4 were downregulated in FLT samples, implicating an overall cell cycle arrest in spaceight samples. Our results also indicate some apparently contradictory ndings, such as the expres- sion levels of genes for cell cycle arrest proteins, Chek2 and Btg2 , were decreased 2.2- and 3.5-fold, respectively in FLT samples, contrary to what is expected for Chek2 when Myc is overexpressed based on what is observed in lymphoma cells 60. Thus, one of the crucial ndings of our study is that spaceight alters the expression levels of major cell cycle and cell growth regulators. As the samples analyzed consist predominantly (but not solely) of fully differentiated non-dividing cardiomyocytes, this suggests that spaceight activates p21- and Myc-related pathways to regulate cell growth, cardiomyocyte function, and potentially cardiomyopathy, although complex interactions such as these remain to be elucidated. 3.3. Apoptosis and DNA Damage Repair-Related Gene Expression in Spaceight Hearts There were no signicant changes in apoptosis-related genes such as p53,Bax,Bcl2, Casp2 orCasp9 (Supplementary Table S2). DNA damage repair genes such as Atr,Xrcc5 , Ercc1 and Apex1 were only moderately altered in spaceight (1.1- to 1.3-fold), suggesting widespread DNA damage responses were not occurring at the time of sample recovery. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that spaceight activates DNA damage and apoptosis pathways in a smaller sub-population of cell types within the heart during spaceight, as shown previously for exposure to low dose, heavy ion radiation (16O, 600 MeVn) simulating space radiation  61. Evidence supporting the possibility that spaceight activates DNA damage pathways andor apoptosis has been reported for tissues other than heart  62, including the thymus  63,64 and the eye  62,64, and multi- omics analyses reveal increased levels of DNA damage markers in urine and blood from astronauts 26. 3.4. Inammatory Pathway Gene Expression in Spaceight Heart Inammatory response genes, such as Tnf(tumor necrosis factor), Tnfrsf10b (Tnfre- ceptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1 (Tnf receptor-associated factor) were signicantly downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease) in FLT samples compared to GRD controls. Tnf is a multifunctional pro-inammatory cytokine, which regulates a wide variety of biological processes such as inammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cyto- toxicity  65. Space is a hazardous environment and proper immune functioning is crucial for astronaut health and success of space missions. The decreased expression of Tnf,Tn- frsf10b and Traf1 observed in our study suggests downregulation of this pro-inammatory signaling pathway, which may lead to compromised immune function. Our results are consistent with other studies showing spaceight reduces Tnfexpression levels in both mice  19,66 and humans  67. In addition, human T cell cultures on the International Space Station (ISS) show a 15-fold decrement in expression of Tnfin T cells and its downstream effectors in microgravity as compared to cells centrifuged at 1g  68. During a very long duration spaceight, TNF expression in the blood of astronauts is elevated  24 but after return to Earth (between days 0 and 5) as skeletal muscle enters a recovery phase, Tnfa expression rapidly declines along with other cytokines in the Il6pathway  69. Together, these ndings implicate a biomechanical, gravity-dependent mechanism for regulating Tnf-related pathways.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 10 of 16 Although the radiation exposure of mice on the STS-131 mission is considered too low to account for our results, relatively low doses of particle radiation (30 cGy) can lead to altered regulation of disease-related pathways and decits in cardiac function  70,71. Furthermore, expression of oxidative stress and inammation markers in the heart caused by low dose gamma radiation exposure is exacerbated when combined with hindlimb unloading  17. Further study is needed to determine the inuence of space radiation in combination with microgravity, on the heart in the spaceight environment during long duration missions. 3.5. Gene Networks and Molecular Signatures of Disease Computational analysis revealed that changes in a subset of genes that were differen- tially expressed due to spaceight were linked to disease, including immune suppression and impairments in glucose homeostasis, consistent with ndings in astronauts  72,73. In addition, a subset of the DEGs resulting from spaceight were associated with cardio- vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular decompensation, hyperten- sive disease and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular decompensation and volumetric changes in blood ow were consistent with previous observations in crew members dur- ing ight  3,8,74. In a previous study on a subset of ISS crewmembers, mean arterial pressures reportedly do not change signicantly during spaceight. However, cardiac output and stroke volume are increased in ight compared to the seated position on Earth (although comparable to the supine position on Earth)  3. Thus, our ndings were con- sistent with previous reports on astronauts indicating that spaceight adversely affects cardiovascular health. Computational analyses also indicated that spaceight led to altered regulation of molecular networks within the oxidative damage response and cell proliferation path- ways. Our ndings suggest that oxidative stress and Trp35 signaling pathways were linked and that spaceight alters gene interactions between these two pathways. Furthermore, transcription factors FoxO3 ,Jun,Myc, and Hif1a were predicted to mediate the interaction between these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene network changes in response to spaceight. Cat,Cdkn1a ,Cdk1 and Cdk4 also were pre- dicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by spaceight. Hence, these molecules may be potential targets for the development of countermeasures against spaceight-induced tissue decits. 3.6. Limitations For extrapolation of ndings from this murine study to humans, there is the inherent limitation of the difference in species as well as a potential inuence of the specic strain and sex which were selected as subjects. Factors related to experimental protocol also important to consider when interpreting gene expression ndings from this experiment include the xed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were returned to Earth (3 hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were housed in ight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the ight mice encountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression did not solely reect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly responding genes, such as Nfe2l2 , also may reect re-entry and re-adaptation to 1-gravity on Earth, however briey. As the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed to elucidate how spaceight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cyclegrowth and function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the space environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart consists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, broblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, each with a discrete gene expression prole  53, future experiments could focus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of specic gene expression changes, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function.Int.

Ethics Statement All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center. The IACUC approval number associated with this animal study was NAS-10-002-Y1. 4.2. Animals and Spaceight The mice in this study were own on the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission for the experiment Mouse Antigen-Specic CD4 T Cell Priming and Memory Response during Spaceight. The heart tissue used in this experiment was an award to E. Almeida as part of the NASA STS-131 Mouse Immunology I Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Female C57BL6J mice were acclimatized to spaceight food bars and lixits, but were not placed in Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats until just before spaceight. Mice were divided into two groups: ight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control. The NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless-steel grid cage, fan blowers, a layered lter system, interior lamps, specialized food bars, and a water box. The AEM units are self-contained habitats that provide group housing with constant ad libitum access to food and water while also providing a waste management system that isolates the animals from their waste. FLT mice were launched at 14 weeks of age then own in space for 15 days and were not subjected to any experimental procedures during spaceight. Synchronous GRD control mice were also housed in AEMs, maintained in an orbital environmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center, and exposed to environmental condi- tions matched closely to those of FLT mice on the shuttle (temperature, lightdark cycle, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels). FLT and GRD control animals were weighed before ight and immediately after return and were subjected to veterinary examination prior to euthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group were measured upon recovery. Animals were euthanized at 16 weeks of age starting approximately 3 h after landing using isourane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Euthanasia and dissections proceeded at a pace of one mouse every 1520 min. The heart was removed and major veins and feed arteries trimmed off. The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic and caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were distributed to another BSP investigator). The frozen samples were transported on dry ice to NASA Ames Research Center and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. 4.3. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis Total RNA was isolated from frozen heart tissue by homogenization and RNA extrac- tion using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Tissue samples were homogenized in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After incubation, 0.2 mL of chloroform was added, the sample agitated vigorously for 30 s and then incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 gfor 15 min at 4C. Following centrifugation, the upper aqueous phases were separated and incubated with 0.5 mL of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature. Sam- ples were then centrifuged at 12,000 gfor 15 min at 4C and the RNA pellet was washed with 70 ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 100 L of nuclease-free water and further puried using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), per instructions. The quantities and qualities of puried RNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientic, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed by running RNA on 0.8 agarose formaldehyde-denaturing gel with ethidium bromide and further visualized by Fluor-S Multimager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 12 of 16 All RNA samples were analyzed by thematic real time PCR arrays (for Oxidative Stress and p53-related pathways) or RT-PCR (for Nfe2l2 ). Although whole transcriptome analysis would be valuable, samples are no longer available for additional analyses. 4.4. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Array An equal amount of RNA (1 g) was used from FLT and GRD samples to synthe- size cDNA using RT2PCR Array First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53Signaling Pathway PCR Array (PAMM-027) according to the manufacturers protocol (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Briey, FLT and GRD cDNA samples were mixed with RT2SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) and dis- tributed across the 96-well plate array. Each of the 96-well plate arrays contained primers for 84 genes related to oxidative stress or p53signaling pathways and control housekeep- ing genes (HKG). PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with initial denaturation at 95C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 s and 60C for one minute. FLT and GRD cDNA samples were also run on control RT2RNA QC PCR Array plates (PAMM-999) to test RNA quality, reverse transcription efciency, PCR efciency and genomic DNA contamination. 4.5. Nfe2l2 Real-Time PCR cDNA was synthesized by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Va- lencia, CA, USA). Briey, 1 g of RNA sample was treated with gDNA Wipeout Buffer at 42C for 2 min then reverse-transcription was performed using Quantiscript RT Buffer and Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase as per manufacturers instruction. The Real-Time PCR mixture was made using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Synthesized cDNA from the previous step was mixed with Quantiscript SYBR Green PCR Mix and Nfe2l2 primer mixture, per manufacturers protocol. Real-time PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with initial activation at 95C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 s and 60C for 1 min. Ct values were retrieved by maintaining the same threshold among all the samples. 4.6. Data Analysis and Statistics For the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53Signaling Pathway PCR Array, relative expression levels of genes were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method ( DDCt) with normalization to the average expression levels of ve house- keeping genes (SABiosciences Data Analysis Software). FLT samples were compared to GRD controls using MannWhitney U Test using p 0.05 as the threshold of signicance and sample size of n  4 mice per group. ForNfe2l2 RT-PCR of heart samples, the change in expression levels were calculated using the DDCt method with Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase ( Hprt ) 1 as house- keeping gene. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from ight and ground control groups was used in the MannWhitney U test at p 0.05, n  4 mice per group. 4.7. Gene Network Predictions and Functional Analysis To generate predictions on potential protein interactions, statistically signicant differ- entially expressed genes from both PCR arrays were entered into the String DB protein- protein interaction database  75. Experimental evidence, databases, and co-expression were used as sources to generate protein interaction networks. The interaction score was set to a threshold of medium (0.400). Toppfun  76 was used to gain insight into whether the differentially expressed genes were linked to human disease phenotypes. Statistically signicant differentially expressed genes were entered into the Toppfun database. The results were ltered using a BenjaminiInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 13 of 16 Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of p 0.05 and a query to genome overlap of four or more genes. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our study revealed that spaceight signicantly altered cardiac expres- sion of genes related to cell cyclegrowth (notably Cdkn1a p21, Cdk1, and Myc), inamma- tion (notably Tnf) and oxidative stress (notably Nfe2l2 ,Nox1, Ptgs2 ), which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These ndings provide novel data suitable for developing testable hypotheses for further study. Identication of specic mechanisms and molecules responsi- ble for excess ROS generation during spaceight is of considerable interest, and may yield new therapeutic approaches.

        "introduction": "Responses to spaceight include cardiovascular decits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes  13. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body uids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a uid shift between the vasculature and interstitium  46. The uid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms  6. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts 7. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning  8, despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy  9,10. A reduction in myocardial interstitial uid may contribute to lower myocardial mass Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088. https:doi.org10.3390ijms22169088 https:www.mdpi.comjournalijmsInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 9088 2 of 16 following microgravity exposure  11. In rodents, 14 days of spaceight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy  12. In contrast, spaceight for one week did not affect cardiac mass  13, although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies  14,15, but not in others  13, thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction  1618. In fact, spaceight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals  1927. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes  28,29 including CDKN1A (also known as P21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1AP21 is a negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceight elevates Cdkn1a expression in bone tissue  30, liver and kidney  31 as well as cultured cells  29, implicating activation of CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment. We hypothesized that spaceight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycleapoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used the- matic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycleapoptosis ( Trp53 ) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression ndings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration spaceight. 2.",
        "conclusion": "s In conclusion, our study revealed that spaceight signicantly altered cardiac expres- sion of genes related to cell cyclegrowth (notably Cdkn1a p21, Cdk1, and Myc), inamma- tion (notably Tnf) and oxidative stress (notably Nfe2l2 ,Nox1, Ptgs2 ), which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These ndings provide novel data suitable for developing testable hypotheses for further study. Identication of specic mechanisms and molecules responsi- ble for excess ROS generation during spaceight is of considerable interest, and may yield new therapeutic approaches.
