Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2\u2009Gy gamma rays ((137)Cs, 0.8\u2009Gy/min) or heavy ions ((56)Fe, 600MeV, 0.50-1.1\u2009Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is \u226510\u2009Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions.

Introduction During a spaceight beyond the Earths protective magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta 2011), including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays andprotons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation.Exposure to space radiation is characterized by relatively low doses ( 2 Gy) of ion species due to solar particle events (Shurshakov and others 1999; Parsons and Townsend 2000)or galactic cosmic rays (Zeitlin and others 2013; Hassler and others 2014). Simulated space radiation at these doses causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to totalvolume as well as a decrement relative to age-matched controls (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010). The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast num-bers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae (Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010; Kondo and others 2010; Willey and others 2010; Yumoto andothers 2010; Lloyd and others 2012).

Exposure to radiation, particularly high-LET particles, has the potential to exacerbate the deleterious ef- fects of musculoskeletal disuse, which occurs during pro-longed bed rest or spaceight (LeBlanc and others 2000; Lang and others 2004, 2006; Keyak and others 2009; Al- wood and others 2010; Yumoto and others 2010). Previous work shows that radiation exposure elicits a transient ( 2 weeks) pro-resorptive state in cancellous tis- sue, resulting in net bone loss compared with basal (time ofradiation) and age-matched controls (Kondo and others2010; Willey and others 2010; Alwood and others 2012). Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are thought to cause the rapid (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010; Turnerand others 2013) cancellous strut losses following simulated space irradiation, leading to loss of microarchitectural in- tegrity (Alwood and others 2010). Radiation exposuretransiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteo- clasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces covered by os- teoclasts. However, the role that receptor activator of nuclearfactor kappa-B ligand ( Rankl ), the principal osteoclasto- genic cytokine, plays in concert with other pro-osteoclastic inammatory cytokines (Kim and others 2006; Takayanagi2007; Boyce and Xing 2008) and oxidative stress is not fullyunderstood with respect to the cancellous bone loss fol- lowing radiation exposure (Kondo and others 2009). Total body irradiation ( 2 Gy) causes time-dependent changes in the bone formation by osteoblasts, although these changes do not account for the early and rapid decrement in bone mass observed following exposure to total body irra-diation within this dose range. Within 3 days of exposure to radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR BS) is unaffected (Kondo and others 2010). Although ra-diation does affect osteoblast function within the rst weekof exposure, as indicated by an observed increase in mineral apposition rate (MAR), a concomitant reduction in the mineralizing surface yields no net change in the bone for-mation rate (Kondo and others 2010). Similarly, Willey and others (2010) also report increased MAR within the rst week after exposure, but subsequently BFRBS declines by2 and 3 weeks after exposure to 2 Gy X-ray, while Turner and others reported transient increased bone formation even after very high doses of radiation (6 Gy). Therefore, radiation-in-duced changes in bone formation are more likely to con- tribute to later remodeling decits rather than acute bone loss. To better understand net bone loss in the acute response to radiation exposure, we examined the temporal expressionwithin both marrow and mineralized tissue of Rankl and select pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines implicated in various models of inammatory bone loss (Braun and Schett 2012)following exposure to low- or high-LET species of radiation. Furthermore, we investigated the temporal expression of a key antioxidant transcription factor (nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2, Nfe2l2 ), which is responsible for mounting a rapid defense against oxidative challenges (Kobayashi and Yamamoto 2005) and is known to play a role in dampeningosteoclastogenesis (Hyeon and others 2013). We hypothesized that radiation exposure induces ex- pression of pro-osteoclastogenic, pro-inammatory, and an-tioxidant genes within both marrow and mineralized tissuecompartments and increases markers of bone resorption. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these changes are likely to contribute to later cancellous bone loss. This work shows anacute and time-dependent elevation of Rankl , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( Mcp1 ), and tumor necrosis factor- alpha ( Tnf) gene expression in the marrow or in skeletal compartments due to low- or high-LET irradiation. Thesemolecular changes precede ( 3 days) the manifestation of bone loss (37 days) following iron irradiation at a dose relevant to fractionated radiotherapy or space missions. Materials and Methods Animals Post-pubescent (16 weeks 4 days at time of irradiation), male C57BL6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were individ-ually housed and provided food (LabDiet 5001) and water ad libitum , as described elsewhere (Yumoto and others 2010). Animals were euthanized by CO 2inhalation or an- esthetized with isourane, followed by blood draw throughcardiac puncture. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees for NASA Ames Research Center and Broo- khaven National Laboratory approved all procedures. Experiment design and radiation exposure Experiments were conducted to determine the temporal changes in the levels of key genes and circulating proteins related to bone resorption in the latency period before theonset of overt structural loss. To evaluate heavy-ion effects, conscious mice were exposed to high-LET iron ions (56Fe, 600 MeVion, 5cGy or 2 Gy, at a rate of 5 or 0.501.10 Gymin, respectively) at the NASA Space Radiation Labora-tory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, or were sham irra- diated as previously described ( n58group). Mice were euthanized and tissues harvested at baseline (ie, time of ir-radiation) or 3 or 7 days after exposure. To evaluate gamma radiation effects, conscious mice were irradiated with low- LET 137Cs gamma rays 2 Gy, 0.80 Gymin, as described in detail in Kondo and others (2010) or were sham irradiated. Euthanasia and tissue harvest took place 4 h or 1 day ( 2 h), 3 days, or 7 days after exposure ( n57group). Bone microarchitecture Bone volume and microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis were quantied by microcomputed tomography (6.8mm pixel size, 3,500 ms integration time, 50 kV, Sky- scan 1174; Bruker microCT) similar to Kondo and others(2009). Briey, a 1.0-mm thick region located 0.24 mm distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected and semiautonomously contoured to include cancelloustissue. To assess bone loss, the bone volume to total volume fraction (BVTV, ), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1mm), and trabecular separation(Tb.Sp, mm) were calculated and reported following con- ventional guidelines (Bouxsein and others 2010). qRT-PCR for gene expression within marrow and skeletal tissue Femora and tibiae were dissected, cleaned of soft tissues, ushed of bone marrow with phosphate-buffered saline,IONIZING RADIATION AND SKELETAL CYTOKINE GENE EXPRESSION 481and stored in RNALater (Qiagen, Inc.) at -80C176C. Bone marrow cells were lysed and preserved with guanidine- thiocyanate-containing RLT buffer (Qiagen, Inc.) with 1beta-mercaptoethanol at -80C176C. RNA was extracted from homogenized bone or marrow lysates using Trizol (Ambion), QIAshredder, and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). For each tissue, RNA was treated with an RNase-free DNase set(Qiagen, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturers in- structions. RNA quality and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). The RNA quality wasconrmed by electrophoresis using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Following the manufacturers recommendations, RNA was reversed transcribed and simultaneously used for qPCR usingthe GoTaq C210Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega). Portions of the following mouse gene sequences were am- plied using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Bio-systems, Inc.): receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( Rankl , assay ID: Mm00441906_m1), Osteoprotegerin (Opg, assay ID: Mm01205928_m1), Tumor necrosis factor- alpha ( Tnf, assay ID: Mm00443260_g1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( Mcp1 , assay ID: Mm00441242_m1), interleukin-6 (Il6, assay ID Mm00446190_m1), tart rate-resistant acid phos- phatase ( Acp5, assay ID: Mm00475698_m1), cathepsin-K ( Ctk, assay ID: Mm00484039_m1), nuclear factor of activated T- cells, cytoplasmic 1 ( Nfatc1 , assay ID: Mm00479445_m1), nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2 ( Nfe2l2 , assay ID: Mm00477784_m1), and colony-stimulating factor 1 ( Csf1, assay ID: Mm00432686_m1). We standardized gene ex- pression levels to mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19(L19, assay ID: Mm02601633_g1) to correct for differences in cellular input and RNA quality and facilitate comparison between samples. Hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( Hprt1 , assay ID: Mm01545399_m1) and trans- membrane protein 40 ( Tmem40 , assay ID: Mm00460636_m1) also were analyzed as alternate housekeeping genes. Thereactions were performed in the 7300 RT-PCR system (AppliedBiosystems) or SmartCycler rea l-time PCR system (Cepheid). We analyzed multiple candidate housekeeping genes for normalization, including L19,Hprt1 , and Tmem40 . Gamma radiation exposure did not modulate levels of the gene L19 at the various time points, but transiently and modestly in- creased gene expression of Hprt1 (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold) and Tmem40 (-1 cycle, 2.3-fold). Following iron irradiation, L19 (as well as Hprt1 ) showed small increases in cycle number due to treatment (-0.4 cycles, 1.4-fold for L19). As these differences in housekeeping gene expression were small relative to those of cytokine and resorption marker levels, results reported were normalized relative to L19 for both gamma and iron irradiation experiments.Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b Blood was collected from the heart at the time of eutha- nasia and serum was separated and stored at -80C176C until processed. Enzyme immunoassays were performed formeasurement of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b), a biomarker for osteoclast-mediated bone re- sorption, using a commercial kit (Immunodiagnostic Sys-tems) according to the manufacturers protocol. Statistics All data are reported as mean standard deviation. To determine signicant differences compared with sham- irradiated controls, a 1-way analysis of variance was usedfollowed by Dunnetts post hoc test. If data were determined to be heteroscedastic (Bartletts test), a Welchs ANOVA test followed by a post hoc test using the Bonferroni cor- rection were used to determine signicant differences from the sham-irradiated controls. Correlation analyses were performed on expression levels of select genes from marrowand bone specimens following gamma irradiation (for thesham and 1, 3, and 7 day endpoints) using the Pearsons product-moment coefcient (r). A Pvalue 0.05 was ac- cepted as signicant for all analyses. All analyses were per-formed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS). Results Cancellous microarchitecture following iron irradiation To determine the extent of bone loss over the short term, mice were irradiated with56Fe ions (600 MeV) or were sham irradiated (0 Gy controls), then 7 days later bones wereharvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal tibia quantied ex vivo using 3D microcomputed tomography. Body weights of irradiated and control animals at the time oftissue harvest did not differ (data not shown). Compared with sham controls, irradiation with 2 Gy reduced BVTV by 16, Tb.N by 15, and showed a trend of increased Tb.Sp by 11(P0.053, ANOVA), but did not affect trabecular thickness (Fig. 1). This is consistent with previous reports (Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010). We included a basal group in our experiments showing BVTV of 25.1  3.6, which was not different from the age-matched sham control group. A lower dose of iron (5 cGy) failed to elicit changes in bone structural parameters compared with controlsand is therefore below the threshold dose for causing bone loss (data not shown). These results validate the model of ionizing radiation-induced cancellous bone loss.

Data are mean SD, with  denot- ingP0.05 versus sham.482 ALWOOD ET AL.Marrow gene expression following iron irradiation To determine if irradiation altered expression of various pro-osteoclastogenic genes, mRNA levels in bone marrowcell lysates were measured using quantitative RT-PCR 3 days after exposure to high-LET iron or sham irradiation. Within 3 days of exposure, iron irradiation increased ex-pression of the Rankl gene by 9.2-fold compared with sham- irradiated controls (Fig. 2). At this time point, transcripts of Opg andMcp1 were not detected in the marrow (data not shown). Radiation exposure did not alter Tnfexpression (Fig. 2). In contrast, a lower dose of iron (5 cGy) did not elicit changes in gene expression (data not shown). Thesedata demonstrated that high-LET particulate irradiation with2 Gy elicited pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine expression in the bone marrow tissue. Gene expression of skeletal tissue following iron irradiation To determine if ionizing radiation altered expression of select genes related to osteoclastogenesis ( Rankl ,Opg) and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption ( Ctk,Acp5 ) in cells within the mineralized compartment of skeletal tissue, RNA was puried from bone after removal of the marrow (leaving predominantly osteocytes). Within 3 days, iron irradiationincreased expression of Rankl by 1.9-fold, Acp5 by 1.5-fold, andCtkby 2.1-fold over sham controls (Fig. 3). Expression levels of Opg did not change. The ratio of RanklOpg ex-pression increased 2.8-fold, which provides a relative index that, on balance, cytokine levels favored increased bone resorption. Marrow gene expression following gamma irradiation To determine whether irradiation altered osteoclastogenic and inammation-related genes, mRNA expression wasmeasured in bone marrow at 4 h or 1, 3, or 7 days after low- LET gamma irradiation and in sham-irradiated controls. Within 4 h, 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated Rankl in bone marrow by 2.6-fold over the sham; gene expression of Opg was undetectable regardless of treatment (data not shown). Subsequently, the expression of many genes of interestmeasured in bone marrow ( Rankl ,Csf1,Nfatc1 ,Tnf,Mcp1 , andIl6) transiently increased within 1 day and subsequently declined toward sham levels (Fig. 4). Expression of Tnf remained elevated through day 3 post-irradiation, while high Rankl expression persisted through day 7 post-irradiation. At their peak, expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes, Rankl and Csf1, and the osteoclast-related transcription factor, Nfatc1 , increased by 4.1-fold, 4.2-fold, and 2.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A, D, E); the Rankl decoy receptor Opg showed a trend toward increased expression by 11.3-fold(P0.053 by ANOVA, Fig. 4B); pro-inammatory genes Tnf,Mcp1 , and Il6increased by 1.7-fold, 11.9-fold, and 1.6- fold, respectively (Fig. 4F, G, H), relative to controls. Theratio of Rankl Opg increased by 1.8-fold at day 7 after ir- radiation (Fig. 4C). Additionally, radiation exposure showed a trend toward increased gene expression of Nfe2l2 by 1.6- fold on day 1 compared with controls ( P0.061 for the ANOVA, Fig. 4I). Notably, levels of Nfe2l2 expression were strongly and positively correlated with the osteoclast-related genes Nfatc1 (P0.05, r0.89), Csf1 (P0.05, r0.63), Tnf(P0.05, r0.62), and Rankl (P0.05, r0.56). These data show the temporal dependence of changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow following radiation exposure. Gene expression of skeletal tissue following gamma irradiation Following gamma irradiation, mRNA levels in femoral mineralized tissue (sans marrow) were quantied at 3 and 7 days after irradiation or sham using qRT-PCR normalized to the housekeeping gene, L19, as shown in Fig. 5. Within 3 days, gamma radiation exposure increased the expression of Rankl (2.3-fold), Acp5 (2.2-fold), and Ctk(2.3-fold). Expression of FIG. 2. 2 Gy iron irradiation effects on cytokine gene expression in tibial marrow cells on day 3 (expression level normalized to L19). Radiation exposure increased the gene expression levels of (A)Rankl. Gene expression levels of (B)Tnfwere unchanged. Data are mean SD, with  de- noting P0.01 versus sham.

These data suggest that bone-embedded andor liningcells contribute to osteoclast stimulation and provide evidence for elevated expression of osteoclastogenic ( Rankl ) and re- sorption-related ( Acp5 ,Ctk) genes in the skeletal tissue. Serum TRACP 5b following gamma irradiation To determine if temporal changes in skeletal gene ex- pression (Figs. 4 and 5) coincide with changes in a protein biomarker of resorption, the c irculating levels of osteo- clast-specic TRACP 5b were measured at 1, 3, and 7 daysafter gamma irradiation and in sham controls. Gamma ir-radiation increased TRACP 5b serum levels by 34 on day 1 and 17 on day 3 compared with sham, with asubsequent gradual decline toward control levels by day 7 (data not shown). Thus, circulating TRACP 5b levels showed a similar time course, although lower in magnitudecompared with skeletal gene expression for Rankl and other pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines. Discussion To better understand the mechanisms underlying radiation- induced stimulation of bone resorption, we investigatedmolecular signals within the latency period between FIG. 4. 2 Gy gamma radi- ation increased expression of pro-osteoclastic and resorp-tion-related genes in pooledtibial and femoral marrow (expression level normalized toL19).

In summary, the results show that exposure to either gamma or heavy-ion radiation increased gene ex-pression for the canonical osteoclastogenic factor, Rankl ,a s well as other pro-osteoclast cytokines ( Mcp1 ,Tnf,Il6); this occurred in both marrow and mineralized tissue. These ndings do not distinguish between changes in gene ex-pression levels due to a shift in the cell population expres- sing osteoclastogenic cytokines, a generally higher level of expression for all the cells, or some combination of both. Infact, after exposure to radiation of sufcient dosage, there are pronounced, if transient, changes in marrow cell via- bility and increases in marrow macrophages, which arelikely to contribute to the generation of new osteoclasts.Therefore, we interpret our results to show that exposure to ionizing radiation increased the tissue concentrations of mRNA levels generally so as to favor osteoclastogenesis. Radiation-induced changes in cytokine expression were temporally related to changes in several indices of bone resorption, including gene expression ( Ctk,Acp5 ,Nfatc1 ) and a serum biomarker (TRACP 5b levels). In addition, marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2 , showed high correlation with the expression levels of several osteoclast-related genes. These data indi- cate that the activation of oxidative defenses and of osteo- clast formation was temporally associated in response toradiation exposure. Our previous work showed radiation-in-duced oxidative damage presents later, at 10 days after ex- posure (Kondo and others 2010). Taken together, our results indicate that Nfe2l2 -related antioxidant defense pathways were insufcient to prevent oxidative damage in bone. Changes in gene expression (as early as 4 h or 1 day) preceded bone loss, which manifested in these experimentsby day 7 after exposure to 2 Gy iron, although in some cases such as gamma irradiation and lower doses of iron, decre- ments in cancellous bone volume can be observed as earlyas 3 days after exposure (Kondo and others 2009; Yumotoand others 2010). Furthermore, a dose threshold was ob- served, as 5 cGy iron exposure failed to elicit changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow or cancellous bonestructure (data not shown); these ndings provide additional indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that early induction of osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression bybiologically effective doses of radiation leads to cancellous bone loss. Together, the results demonstrate that radiation-induced structural changes were associated with a marrow environ- ment favoring stimulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity by Rankl and other inammation-related cytokines as follows: Radiation increased gene expression levels for pro-osteoclastogenic signaling molecules ( Csf1,Rankl ,Tnf), as well as a trend toward increasing antiosteoclastogenic mole- cules ( Opg), in the marrow and mineralized tissue of irradiated mice compared with sham controls. Iron irradiation elevated the ratio of RanklOpg in both the marrow and skeletal tissue by day 3, whereas after gamma irradiation, the ratio was el-evated in the marrow at 4 h and then again at day 7. A rapid stimulation of Rankl expression by irradiation in the marrow and bone compartment, potentially from he-matopoietic lineage cells (Pacici 2010, 2012; Fumoto and others 2014) or stromal lineage cells (Suda and others 1999; Boyle and others 2003), is consistent with studies that usedradiotherapeutic doses and regimens. In young mice, a sin-gle dose of 5 or 10 Gy increased RanklOpg in whole femora within 3 days (Han and others 2014). Using mice decient in the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2 , radiation exposure at high dose (20 Gy) increased RNA expression forRankl in cultured osteoblasts grown ex vivo , but this was not observed in cells from wild-type mice (Rana and others 2012). These ndings suggest an Nfe2l2 -mediated increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes may dampen bone resorption responses to radiation. Furthermore, when a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) capable of differentiating into osteoclast-like cells after RANKL treatment is exposed to ionizing radiation (2 Gy gamma), gene expression levels rise for b 3 integrin, an adhesion receptor that is important for osteoclast differen-tiation, as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa- B(Rank ), the receptor for Rankl on osteoclasts (Yang and others 2012). In other in vitro work, irradiation with 2 or 4 Gy increases Rankl in differentiated, MC3T3-E1 osteo- blast-like cells (Yang and others 2013). Our work is the rst to demonstrate the time course of radiation-induced changesin expression of various osteoclastogenic cytokines follow- ing 2 Gy exposure (both low- and high-LET) with subse- quent bone loss and within the upper range of space-relevantdoses and types of radiation. Ionizing radiation also increased tissue expression of pro- inammatory, osteoclastogenic ligands, Mcp1 ,Tnf, and Il6, which are all factors generally thought to stimulate osteo-clast activity (Takayanagi 2007) in the presence of RANKL (Kostenuik and Shalhoub 2001; Yu and others 2004; Kim and others 2005, 2006; Sul and others 2012; Liu and others2013). In some reports, TNF may act independently of RANKL to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (Kobayashi and others 2000). Our results are consistent with other workshowing that in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation leads to rapid, complex, and interrelated sequence of signals con- stituting an immune-related cytokine response in bonemarrow (Schaue and McBride 2010; Willey and others2011; Schaue and others 2012; Buchwald and Aurora 2013). At a very high dose (10 Gy), which is sufcient to ablate the bone marrow of hematopoietic cells, radiation causes boneloss related to elevated fractalkine expression by vascular endothelial cells, inammatory cytokines Tnf, interleukin 1 beta, and interferon gamma, and recruitment of pre-osteoclasts (CD11b) (Han and others 2014). Additionally, the time course of cytokine and resorption-related gene expression shown in this study coincides with that of mar-row cell death and repopulation (Otsuka and others 2008; Kondo and others 2010), suggesting a possible relationship between an expanded population of marrow macrophagesclearing apoptotic cells and debris after irradiation, thedifferentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, and in- creased resorption activity. Taken together, these data lead us to propose a 2-stage process for radiation-induced osteoclastogenesis: rst, radiation-induced gene expression of osteoclastogenic cy- tokines leads to enrichment of the marrow with osteoclastprecursors (monocytemacrophage, myeloid lineage cells) and drives differentiation into osteoclasts, and, second, that inammation-related cytokines co-stimulate differentiatingand mature osteoclasts. As a functional measure of active osteoclasts, we provide evidence that 2 Gy gamma irradiation elevated circulatinglevels of osteoclast-specic TRACP 5b protein, indicative ofIONIZING RADIATION AND SKELETAL CYTOKINE GENE EXPRESSION 485increased bone resorption. In this work, the radiation-in- duced elevation in serum TRACP 5b returned to control levels by day 7 following exposure, These results are con-sistent with those reported by Willey and others (2010,2011) showing that X-irradiation (2 Gy) of female mice increases circulating TRACP 5b levels 1, 3, and 7 days after irradiation. Radiation-induced decrements in cancellous tissue ob- served in these experiments were consistent with our pre- vious results. Acute cancellous bone loss temporallymanifests on day 3 at a dose as low as 10 cGy iron (Yumoto and others 2010). Persistent structural decrements (lasting 1 week) manifest at doses above 50 cGy iron (Yumoto and others 2010) and 1 Gy gamma exposure (Hamilton andothers 2006; Kondo and others 2010) before being over- taken, in the case of gamma irradiation, by age-related bone loss (Alwood and others 2012). Taken together, given theobserved time course of skeletal gene expression and serum resorption markers, we conclude that the structural decits arose from a spike in osteoclastogenic cytokine expressionthat follows exposure to ionizing radiation (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010). Limitations of this work include the dose rate used to model space radiation. It is an open question whether lower dose rate exposures that constitute true space radiation stimulate osteoclasts and bone loss to the same extent as theexposures used here. In addition, other signaling molecules,including various other cytokines not studied here, are likely also to play a role in regulating bone resorption after chal- lenge with ionizing radiation, while changes in osteoblastlineage cells are likely to be important for maintaining structural integrity at later times post-irradiation. In conclusion, an improved understanding of the molec- ular response to radiation exposure may aid the development of biological treatments to mitigate potentially deleterious skeletal consequences during space ight.

        "introduction": "During a spaceight beyond the Earths protective magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta 2011), including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays andprotons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation.Exposure to space radiation is characterized by relatively low doses ( 2 Gy) of ion species due to solar particle events (Shurshakov and others 1999; Parsons and Townsend 2000)or galactic cosmic rays (Zeitlin and others 2013; Hassler and others 2014). Simulated space radiation at these doses causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to totalvolume as well as a decrement relative to age-matched controls (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010). The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast num-bers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae (Hamilton and others 2006; Alwood and others 2010; Kondo and others 2010; Willey and others 2010; Yumoto andothers 2010; Lloyd and others 2012).

Exposure to radiation, particularly high-LET particles, has the potential to exacerbate the deleterious ef- fects of musculoskeletal disuse, which occurs during pro-longed bed rest or spaceight (LeBlanc and others 2000; Lang and others 2004, 2006; Keyak and others 2009; Al- wood and others 2010; Yumoto and others 2010). Previous work shows that radiation exposure elicits a transient ( 2 weeks) pro-resorptive state in cancellous tis- sue, resulting in net bone loss compared with basal (time ofradiation) and age-matched controls (Kondo and others2010; Willey and others 2010; Alwood and others 2012). Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are thought to cause the rapid (Kondo and others 2009; Willey and others 2010; Turnerand others 2013) cancellous strut losses following simulated space irradiation, leading to loss of microarchitectural in- tegrity (Alwood and others 2010). Radiation exposuretransiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteo- clasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces covered by os- teoclasts. However, the role that receptor activator of nuclearfactor kappa-B ligand ( Rankl ), the principal osteoclasto- genic cytokine, plays in concert with other pro-osteoclastic inammatory cytokines (Kim and others 2006; Takayanagi2007; Boyce and Xing 2008) and oxidative stress is not fullyunderstood with respect to the cancellous bone loss fol- lowing radiation exposure (Kondo and others 2009). Total body irradiation ( 2 Gy) causes time-dependent changes in the bone formation by osteoblasts, although these changes do not account for the early and rapid decrement in bone mass observed following exposure to total body irra-diation within this dose range. Within 3 days of exposure to radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR BS) is unaffected (Kondo and others 2010). Although ra-diation does affect osteoblast function within the rst weekof exposure, as indicated by an observed increase in mineral apposition rate (MAR), a concomitant reduction in the mineralizing surface yields no net change in the bone for-mation rate (Kondo and others 2010). Similarly, Willey and others (2010) also report increased MAR within the rst week after exposure, but subsequently BFRBS declines by2 and 3 weeks after exposure to 2 Gy X-ray, while Turner and others reported transient increased bone formation even after very high doses of radiation (6 Gy). Therefore, radiation-in-duced changes in bone formation are more likely to con- tribute to later remodeling decits rather than acute bone loss. To better understand net bone loss in the acute response to radiation exposure, we examined the temporal expressionwithin both marrow and mineralized tissue of Rankl and select pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines implicated in various models of inammatory bone loss (Braun and Schett 2012)following exposure to low- or high-LET species of radiation. Furthermore, we investigated the temporal expression of a key antioxidant transcription factor (nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2, Nfe2l2 ), which is responsible for mounting a rapid defense against oxidative challenges (Kobayashi and Yamamoto 2005) and is known to play a role in dampeningosteoclastogenesis (Hyeon and others 2013). We hypothesized that radiation exposure induces ex- pression of pro-osteoclastogenic, pro-inammatory, and an-tioxidant genes within both marrow and mineralized tissuecompartments and increases markers of bone resorption. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these changes are likely to contribute to later cancellous bone loss. This work shows anacute and time-dependent elevation of Rankl , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( Mcp1 ), and tumor necrosis factor- alpha ( Tnf) gene expression in the marrow or in skeletal compartments due to low- or high-LET irradiation. Thesemolecular changes precede ( 3 days) the manifestation of bone loss (37 days) following iron irradiation at a dose relevant to fractionated radiotherapy or space missions. Materials and",
