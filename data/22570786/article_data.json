Osteoporosis can profoundly a ect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses ( 100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated(total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell dierentiation from the marrow was una ected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural chang es normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis. 1. Introduction Osteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences and poses a substantial health care burden currently a ecting an estimated 44 million Americans (NIH). In women, estro-gen deciency is primarily responsible for the rapid postme-nopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility(type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or se-nile osteoporosis) a ects both men and women late in life 1. Bone structure begins to decline early  2; peak bone mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively dec-lines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in thesurrounding hard cortical shell. The compartments of boneaected by osteoporosis can include both the dense tissue that forms an outer structural shell (cortical bone) and thespongy tissue (cancellous bone) within the marrow cavity;the microarchitecture of cancellous bone is profoundlyaected in osteoporosis and renders sites that are rich in can- cellous tissue, such as the spine and proximal femur, prone tofracture. An age-related decline in cancellous tissue structureoccurs in rodents over a matter of months, rather than years, as in humans. C57BL6J mice provide a well-established ani- mal model with relatively rapid postpubertal loss of cancel-lous tissue  3,4, characteristic of that which precedes the development of senile, type II osteoporosis in humans. Bone turnover is regulated by a balance between the ac- tivities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing os- teoclasts. Osteoblasts progressively di erentiate from pro- genitors and mesenchymal stem cells whereas osteoclasts are haematopoietic derivatives of the monocytemacrophage lin-eage. Stem cells, progenitors, and precursors of both lineages reside within the bone marrow. Bone marrow cells cultured ex vivo retain behavioral characteristics of in vivo function; thus bone marrow-derived cells cultured under conditions tailored either to stimulate osteoblast di erentiation (osteo- blastogenesis) or osteoclast di erentiation (osteoclastogene- sis) are useful tools to dissect cellular and molecular bases of physiological challenges such as skeletal aging and exposureto radiation  58.2 Journal of Aging Research Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygennitrogen species (ROSRNS) both by the ionization of target mol-ecules and by perturbations to the cellular redox state, alsoimplicated in the development of osteoporosis  912. The production of ROSRNS causes oxidative damage to DNA,lipids, and protein inuencing key cell functions, including proliferation, di erentiation, and apoptosis. Low Linear En- ergy Transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays,X-rays) at high cumulative doses ( 200 cGy) can damage vascular supply (osteoradionecrosis), leading to loss of cor-tical and cancellous tissue and leading to skeletal fragility13, while adverse e ects of lower doses (100200 cGy) ap- pear to be conned to cancellous tissue in animal models12,1416. Much less is known about how low doses in- uence skeletal health. Here we hypothesized that low-to-moderate doses of ion- izing radiation accelerate postpubertal and progressive lossof microarchitectural integrity over time. Ionizing radiationat 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) caused structuralchanges in cancellous tissue within one month that occurredover 4 months in controls, with no further decrements fol-lowing 1 month. The capability of marrow-derived cell pop-ulations to di erentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts was unaected. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experiment Design. A total of 96 C57BL6J 10-week old male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) werehoused 2cage for up to 4 months. This age and duration ofthe experiment were selected on the basis of results reportedby others, showing that this encompasses a period of micro-architectural changes that are associated with osteopenia (re-d u c e db o n ed e n s i t y )o v e rt i m e 3,4. Mice were provided food (LabDiet 5001, Purina Mills, Gray Summit, MO) and water ad libitum . After three days of cage acclimation, un- anesthetized mice (4 per exposure) were irradiated (IR; JLShepherd Mark I, 137Cs gamma ray source, San Gabriel, CA) with 1, 10, or 100 cGy at 0.96, 0.96, or 88 cGymin ( 10), respectively, or were sham-irradiated (0 cGy-controls). Theexposure eld was 26.5 19.5 cm2.T oe x p o s es a m p l e se v e n l y , mice were placed in container (10 cm radius), centered 18 cmfrom the source, and rotated at 6 rpm. Radiation dose anduniformity was calibrated in air by JL Shepherd  Asso-ciates using an X-ray Monitor (no. 2025, MDH Industries,Monrovia, CA) with a 0.18 cm 3probe (National Institutes of Standards and T echnology traceable). Tissues were harvestedon the day of IR (basal) or 1 or 4 months later ( n 8group), with cell culture being performed at the latter two endpoints.As an indicator of health, total body mass was measured(E0D120 scale, Ohaus Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) at leastonce per week until tissue harvest. The Institutional AnimalCare and Use Committee of NASA Ames Research Centerapproved all procedures. 2.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture. Skeletal microarchitecture broadly characterizes the 3D network of cancellous (orspongy) bone. Microcomputed tomography (vivaCT 40,SCANCO Medical AG, Br uttisellen, Switzerland) allows direct quantication of the microarchitecture of mineralizedtissue (10.5 m voxel size) within the proximal tibia meta- physis  17. Standard indices  18 were generated within the excised right tibia in a region 0.2 to 1.2 mm distal to theproximal growth plate via semiautonomous contouring of cross-sectional slices, as reported in detail previously  15. T h er e l a t i v ea m o u n to fb o n et ot o t a lv o l u m e( B V  T V ,b o n evolume fraction) quanties the amount of bone present. Thethickness of the bony struts, the thickness (or spacing) of themarrow voids, and trabecular number characterize trabecu-lar morphologys on average  19. Connectivity density quan- ties the number of trabecular struts per volume in the bonynetwork  20. The structure model index measures the ratio of rod-like ( 3) to plate-like ( 0) trabeculae within the tissue 19. The fabric tensor quanties the anisotropic orientation of the structure, relating to mechanical properties  21,22, with three eigenvalues describing the axial lengths of theanisotropy ellipsoid and the degree of anisotropy equalingthe ratio of the maximum to minimum eigenvalues. 2.3. Primary Bone Marrow Culture. Marrow cells from the hindlimbs (femora and tibiae) were grown as previously de-scribed  7. In brief, cells were ushed from the bone mar- row and plated in -MEM supplemented with 15 fetal calf serum with osteoblastogenic supplements (ascorbate50gmL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and -glycero- phosphate (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For os-teoclastogenesis, cells were plated overnight in macrophagecolony stimulating factor (MCSF, 30 ngmL, RD Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and nonadherent cells collected, re- plated, and grown in -MEM supplemented with 15 fetal calf serum with MCSF (30 ngmL) and soluble receptor acti-vator of nuclear factor Bl i g a n d( s R A N K L ,6 0n g  m L ,P e p r o - tech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Osteoclastogenesis was assessed 4-5days after euthanasia by counting the number of multinu-cleated, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP,Sigma Aldrich) cells in a dened area by microscopy (be-tween 18 and 45 mm 2) to count a minimum of 200 cells. Os- teoblastogenesis was assessed one month after irradiation byquantifying the surface area covered by alizarin red-stained,mineralized nodules. 2.4. Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 8 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). T o address aging, threegroups of sham controls were collected at di erent time points for analysis. Least squares linear regressions were per-formed with time as regressor and the null hypothesis of theslope being zero to assess changes over time. The coe cient of determination ( R 2) and the probability ( P) of the slope being zero are reported, with P0.05 the threshold for re- jecting the null hypothesis. For each time point after-irradiation, comparisons were made between the sham-irradiated and irradiated mice. An-alyses proceeded using one-factor ANOV A with the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Signicant Di erence post hoc test, and P 0.05 considered the threshold for signicance. All gures report meanstandard deviation (SD).Journal of Aging Research 3 40 32 3028 26 2422 20 0 1 02 03 035 302520 0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 Time after irradiation (day)Body mass (g) 0 cGy 1 cGy10 cGy 100 cGy  Figure 1: Mouse body mass as a function of age and radiation exposure.

Mean SD.DenotesP 0.05 for changes with age (linear regression) for the respective cohorts (1and 4 months after irradiation). 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Body Mass. Body weights were measured weekly during the experiment. Sham-irradiated mice gained 10 bodymass from 1014 wk of age ( Figure 1 . inset,R 20.96,P 0.05 for slope) and 30 body mass from 1027 wk of age (R20.99,P 0.05 for slope). Compared to the age- matched controls, irradiation at any dose did not a ect the mass accrual ( Figure 1 ). These data are consistent with pre- vious studies that monitored radiation and aging e ects 3,4 and show that normal accrual of body mass, as a broad measure of health over time at this age, was unimpeded by exposure to gamma irradiation with these doses. 3.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture: T emporal Changes. Can- cellous microarchitecture was evaluated using 3D microcom-puted tomography. In sham-control mice, the cancellousbone volume fraction remained constant ( Figure 2(a) ), bone density increased, and most microarchitectural parameters declined as the mice aged over the 4-month period of this study. Trabecular number ( 21,R20.79,P 0.05) and connectivity density ( 49,R20.75,P 0.05) declined over 4 months (Figures 2(d) and 2(e) ). Structure model in- dex was unchanged within 4 months ( Figure 2(f) ). Each eig- envalue of the anisotropy tensor increased (all P 0.05) within 4 months. The maximum eigenvalue increased 15,R 20.30 ( Figure 2(g) ). The minimum eigenvalue increased 24,R20.49 (data not shown). The remaining eigenvalue increased 23, R20.59 (data not shown). The degree of anisotropy remained constant at 2.0 indicating a persistentlongitudinal orientation of the structure ( Figure 2(h) ). In contrast to these indicators of increasing structural fragilitywith aging, trabecular thickness (22, R 20.35,P 0.05) as in  3, and tissue density (9, R20.59,P 0.05) rose o v e r4m o n t h s( F i g u r e s 2(b) and 2(c) ). We observed age-related changes in the cancellous mi- croarchitecture of the tibia within the 4-month timeframe.In our study, declines in trabecular number and connectivity density ensued, while relative bone volume, rod-like mor- phology and degree of anisotropy remained constant. Con-currently, the cancellous tissue consolidated gains into thick-er and denser, though fewer, trabecular struts. Trabeculaewere spaced farther apart with age (data not shown) and mayincrease the propensity for strut buckling  23,24. These cha- nges are consistent with normal aging of male C57BL6 mice,including declines of trabecular number and connectivity de-nsity, which appeared to start sooner and fall more rapidlywith aging than the bone volume fraction  3,4. In sum, these data suggest that age-related alterations of microarchi-tecture within the mouse tibia may precede overt declines incancellous bone volume. 3.3. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Ionizing Radiation-Induced Changes. Radiation doses of 1 cGy or 10 cGy had no dis- cernible e ect on skeletal microarchitecture at either 1 or 4 months after-IR. In 100 cGy-IR mice, trabecular number andconnectivity density declined ( 20 and36, resp.; P 0.05) and trabecular spacing and the maximum eigenvalues of the fabric tensor increased (28 and 21, resp.;P 0.05) at one month after-IR compared to age-matched controls ( Figure 2 ). There were no additional decrements in microarchitecture compared to age-matched controls be-tween 1 and 4 months after-IR ( Figure 2 ). These results in- dicate that 100 cGy irradiation caused rapid removal oftrabecular, which resembled the normal microarchitecturalchanges expected to occur during 4 months of aging. Irradiation with 100 cGy caused reductions in trabecular number and connectivity density and increases in the majoraxis of the anisotropy ellipsoid within 1 monthchangesthat take 4 months to appear in sham-irradiated controls. Inprevious studies that used older mice (16 weeks of age),100 cGy caused bone loss in the tibia via reduced trabecularthickness, but not trabecular number, with the onset ofosteopenia appearing 10 days after-irradiation  15. The 16- week-old mice are past peak cancellous bone volume in thetibia, whereas the 10-week-old mice in this study have notyet begun to decline. Microarchitectural changes followingirradiation observed in this study resembled the e ects of a larger dose in older, male mice (16 weeks, 200 cGy) with- in the lumbar spine (a denser, plate-like cancellous tissue)15 and in the tibia (unpublished results), where gamma irradiation at 200 cGy caused vertebral and tibial bone lossvia trabecular number and connectivity density decrementsappearing within 3 days and persisting at least until 30 daysafter-irradiation. This supports trabecular thinning preced-ing strut removal during bone resorption. Furthermore, inyoung female mice (9 weeks), osteopenia and trabecularnumber and connectivity density decrements persist in thetibia at 120 days after-irradiation  14. T aken together, the data indicate that bone resorption is a time-dependent proc-ess contingent on initial bone volume and morphology (i.e.,4 Journal of Aging Research 0.3 0.20.1 0 01234BVTV Time after irradiation (mo) (a)01 234950 900 850 800 0Tissue density (mg HAcm3) Time after irradiation (mo) (b) 0 123470 60 50 40 0Tb.Th(m) Time after irradiation (mo) (c)0 12346.5 6 5.5 5 4.5 0Tb.N(1mm) Time after irradiation (mo)  (d) 01234200 150100 50 0Conn.D (1mm3) Time after irradiation (mo)  (e)012343 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0SMI Time after irradiation (mo) (f) 0 cGy 1 cGy10 cGy 100 cGy012340.5 0.4 0.3 0H2(mm) Time after irradiation (mo)  (g)0 cGy 1 cGy10 cGy 100 cGy012342.5 2.25 2 1.75 1.5 0DA Time after irradiation (mo) (h) Figure 2: Cancellous microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis as a function of age and radiation exposure at the time of irradiation (basal, 0 months) and 1 and 4 months after irradiation.

In this study, microarchitectural di erences between irradiated and age-matched controls were not evident 4 months after exposure to 100 cGy radiation. This result con-trasts to the persistence of osteopenia in the tibia after lowLET irradiation at higher doses ( 200 cGy X-ray or gamma rays) or with particulate irradiation at doses of 100 cGy (pro-ton)  25 and 200 cGy ( 56Fe)  14 which present at 120 days after-irradiation in female mice (9 weeks). These ndingshighlight the importance of age at the time of irradiation; ge-nder also may inuence skeletal radioresponses and furtherstudy is needed in this area. 3.4. Bone Cell Di erentiation Potential. T o assess di erentia- tion of osteoblast lineage progenitors and precursors in themesenchymal stem cell lineage, adherent cells from bonemarrow were cultured in osteogenic medium up to one month and then stained for mineralized nodules ( Figure 3 ). Irradiation did not a ect the area covered by mineralized nodules ( Figure 3(a) ). These data suggest the osteoblast pro- geny of irradiated cells are not a ected by a single, acute dose of low LET, ionizing radiation. Bone marrow cells were cultured after tissue harvest in osteoclastogenic media and then osteoclast number counted.In sham-irradiated controls, between 1 and 4 months after-IR, the density of osteoclasts remained constant ( Figure 3(b) ) and indicates the number of precursors did not vary withage. Furthermore, irradiation at any dose did not a ect the dierentiation potential of osteoclasts compared to controls. Per animal, the ratio of nodule area fraction to osteoclast de-nsity was calculated as a measure of the balance betweenformation and resorption potential; this was unchanged incontrols between 1 and 4 months and unchanged after ir-radiation at any dose (data not shown).6 Journal of Aging Research Thus, neither osteoblastogenesis nor osteoclastogenesis by bone marrow cells was a ected by gamma irradiation, consistent with our previous ndings. These results suggestthe ability of marrow-derived progenitors to contribute toskeletal remodeling is preserved, despite exposure to ionizingradiation. Gamma rays or X-rays (200 cGy) can cause a ra- pid (within 3 days) increase in the numbers of osteoclasts lining the surfaces of trabeculae  15,16, and a decrement in actively mineralizing surfaces, an index of the activity of ma-ture, active osteoblasts  12. T aken together, our results sug- gest that mature cells of the osteoblast and osteoclast lin-eage, rather than progenitors, are responsible for the near-term microarchitectural changes triggered by gamma radia-tion. A limitation of this study design is that bones were an- alyzed at only two time points after exposure to radiation.Additional timepoints would be useful to further charac-terize the inuence of radiation on age-related changes inskeletal health. 4. Conclusions A moderate dose (100 cGy) of gamma radiation acceleratedchanges in the trabecular microarchitecture of postpubertal,growing (10 wk old) male C57BL6 mice at a rate comparable to later skeletal aging in controls, whereas no e ects were observed at even lower doses (1 or 10 cGy). T ogether with thending that BVTV did not di er over this time, these results suggest age-related microarchitectural changes precedebone loss. Bone marrow-derived osteoblast progenitors andosteoclast precursors did not appear to be a ected by the low-to-moderate doses of low LET gamma radiation usedhere, suggesting stem and progenitor cells that reside in themarrow will retain the ability to contribute to skeletal re-modeling during subsequent aging following the low-to-moderate doses employed. In contrast, exposure to high dos-es of gamma radiation  6 or to high LET irradiation such as 56Fe can inict acute and persistent damage to osteo- progenitors ( 7, unpublished observations). In conclusion, ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or10 cGy) appeared to accelerate structural changes in the mur-ine skeleton, expected also to occur during progressive, post-pubertal aging in humans prior to the onset of type II os-teoporosis.

        "introduction": "Osteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences and poses a substantial health care burden currently a ecting an estimated 44 million Americans (NIH). In women, estro-gen deciency is primarily responsible for the rapid postme-nopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility(type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or se-nile osteoporosis) a ects both men and women late in life 1. Bone structure begins to decline early  2; peak bone mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively dec-lines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in thesurrounding hard cortical shell. The compartments of boneaected by osteoporosis can include both the dense tissue that forms an outer structural shell (cortical bone) and thespongy tissue (cancellous bone) within the marrow cavity;the microarchitecture of cancellous bone is profoundlyaected in osteoporosis and renders sites that are rich in can- cellous tissue, such as the spine and proximal femur, prone tofracture. An age-related decline in cancellous tissue structureoccurs in rodents over a matter of months, rather than years, as in humans. C57BL6J mice provide a well-established ani- mal model with relatively rapid postpubertal loss of cancel-lous tissue  3,4, characteristic of that which precedes the development of senile, type II osteoporosis in humans. Bone turnover is regulated by a balance between the ac- tivities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing os- teoclasts. Osteoblasts progressively di erentiate from pro- genitors and mesenchymal stem cells whereas osteoclasts are haematopoietic derivatives of the monocytemacrophage lin-eage. Stem cells, progenitors, and precursors of both lineages reside within the bone marrow. Bone marrow cells cultured ex vivo retain behavioral characteristics of in vivo function; thus bone marrow-derived cells cultured under conditions tailored either to stimulate osteoblast di erentiation (osteo- blastogenesis) or osteoclast di erentiation (osteoclastogene- sis) are useful tools to dissect cellular and molecular bases of physiological challenges such as skeletal aging and exposureto radiation  58.2 Journal of Aging Research Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygennitrogen species (ROSRNS) both by the ionization of target mol-ecules and by perturbations to the cellular redox state, alsoimplicated in the development of osteoporosis  912. The production of ROSRNS causes oxidative damage to DNA,lipids, and protein inuencing key cell functions, including proliferation, di erentiation, and apoptosis. Low Linear En- ergy Transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays,X-rays) at high cumulative doses ( 200 cGy) can damage vascular supply (osteoradionecrosis), leading to loss of cor-tical and cancellous tissue and leading to skeletal fragility13, while adverse e ects of lower doses (100200 cGy) ap- pear to be conned to cancellous tissue in animal models12,1416. Much less is known about how low doses in- uence skeletal health. Here we hypothesized that low-to-moderate doses of ion- izing radiation accelerate postpubertal and progressive lossof microarchitectural integrity over time. Ionizing radiationat 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) caused structuralchanges in cancellous tissue within one month that occurredover 4 months in controls, with no further decrements fol-lowing 1 month. The capability of marrow-derived cell pop-ulations to di erentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts was unaected. 2. Materials and",
        "conclusion": "s A moderate dose (100 cGy) of gamma radiation acceleratedchanges in the trabecular microarchitecture of postpubertal,growing (10 wk old) male C57BL6 mice at a rate comparable to later skeletal aging in controls, whereas no e ects were observed at even lower doses (1 or 10 cGy). T ogether with thending that BVTV did not di er over this time, these results suggest age-related microarchitectural changes precedebone loss. Bone marrow-derived osteoblast progenitors andosteoclast precursors did not appear to be a ected by the low-to-moderate doses of low LET gamma radiation usedhere, suggesting stem and progenitor cells that reside in themarrow will retain the ability to contribute to skeletal re-modeling during subsequent aging following the low-to-moderate doses employed. In contrast, exposure to high dos-es of gamma radiation  6 or to high LET irradiation such as 56Fe can inict acute and persistent damage to osteo- progenitors ( 7, unpublished observations). In conclusion, ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or10 cGy) appeared to accelerate structural changes in the mur-ine skeleton, expected also to occur during progressive, post-pubertal aging in humans prior to the onset of type II os-teoporosis.
