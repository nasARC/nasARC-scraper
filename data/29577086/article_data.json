KatharoSeq enables high-throughput microbiome analysis from low-biomass JPLspacecraft assembly facility, NICU, andabalone-rearing facilityRESEARCH ARTICLE Novel Systems Biology Techniques crossm MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 1environment, low biomass, metagenomics, microbial ecology, neonatal intensive care unit, NICU Many emerging applications of the microbiome, ranging from forensics ( 1)t o medicine to optimization of the cleanliness of facilities where sensitive compo- nents are assembled ( 2,3), require analysis of low-biomass samples. These applications are moving rapidly away from microbial load measurement and toward the character-ization of microbial community composition. Recent studies of the built environmenthave identied key factors driving the microbiome on surfaces and in air, including thetransfer of microbes from humans to environmental surfaces ( 4), due to the fact that humans can shed 10 million bacteriah in indoor settings ( 5). Other key factors modifying the indoor microbiome include temperature, humidity, airow rates ( 6), ventilation type ( 4), and patients or health care workers ( 7). However, built environ- ments low in microbial biomass remain difcult to study because of poor DNAextraction and amplication efciency. Spacecraft assembly facilities (SAFs) are extremely low-microbial-biomass environ- ments, even compared to other built or low-biomass environments such as hospitals( 6), pharmaceutical production facilities ( 8), and indoor environments ( 3), because the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) takes extreme steps to avoidthe transfer of any terrestrial contaminants to other planets ( 9). More than 15 years of microbiological surveys of various NASA and European Space Agency cleanroomfacilities showed that 1 to 10 m 2needs to be sampled to obtain reproducible micro- biome signatures by Sanger sequencing, PhyloChip, 454 pyrosequencing, or Illuminasequencing ( 2). These procedures are critical because NASA allows only swabs, not larger sampling devices, for the collection of materials from sensitive spacecraft hard-ware surfaces (e.g., components of a sampling or life detection system, typically withsurface areas of H110211m 2). However, many other low-microbial-biomass environments are of considerable interest, including neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) ( 10,11) and aquaculture ( 12) settings, motivating the development of a general technique that works across these environments. We developed a new protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos, meaning clean or pure), that combines high sensitivity and low contamination to study the nature anddistribution of the few microbes that survive in low-microbial-biomass settings. Be-cause many popular DNA extraction and amplication kits are contaminated with tracelevels of microbial DNA, we reasoned that spiked positive controls would be essentialin determining whether amplicon products from low-biomass samples are true reec-tions of the environment ( 13,14). Many investigators have also expressed concern that high-throughput methods introduce well-to-well contamination or reduced efciency,and thus, laborious and time-consuming single-tube extractions must be performed.KatharoSeq consists of a commercial off-the-shelf high-throughput DNA extractionprotocol, combined with carefully arranged titrations of positive and negative controlsat the DNA extraction and library construction phase to assess cell counts and well-to-well contamination, together with an integrated bioinformatics pipeline for calcu-lating and applying sample exclusion that is compatible with either amplicon sequenc-ing or shotgun metagenomics. To demonstrate KatharoSeqs utility, we applied it to three disparate built environ- ments with low microbial biomass. These samples consisted of 100 25-cm 2oor samples and 92 controls from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) SAF, 335 locations(primarily 25 cm 2) across all 52 rooms of the NICU with 53 controls, and 159 sampling points (primarily 25 cm2) within an endangered-abalone-rearing facility with 33 con- trols. RESULTS Choosing a DNA extraction technique for KatharoSeq. We benchmarked several different high-throughput commercial DNA extraction and bead cleanup techniquesMinich et al. MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 2and compared them to single-tube extractions by processing negative and positive controls. For positive controls, a single bacterial isolate, Bacillus subtilis , was grown and then sorted with a uorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) so that a titration of cells(nH110055, 50, 500, or 5,000) could be processed and compared across techniques ( Fig. 1a ). The Mo Bio PowerMag with a ClearMag bead cleanup step consistently performed best,as it had the lowest limit of detection and thus was chosen for KatharoSeq ( Fig. 1b ). With a 50-cell input, we could differentiate the positive control, B. subtilis , from the negative controls, although only 28.8 of the sequences aligned with the target. Witha 500-cell input, 90.6 of the reads were mapped to Bacillus with all 18 replicates generating sufcient sequences for analysis, thus placing a conservative limit of detec-tion at 500 cells ( Fig. 1b ). On the basis of these titrations from the Mo Bio PowerMag- with-ClearMag protocol, we determined the total background noise of the entirepipeline ( Fig. 2 ) to be approximately 96.88 cells per sample ( K12)from an allosteric sigmoidal distribution, R2H110050.9209 ( Fig. 1c ). Thus, if a given sample has an initial starting quantity of 96.9 cells, approximately 50 of the reads will be the primarysample while the other 50 will be contaminant. Of the low-throughput methods, theQiagen Ultraclean Pathogen kit performed best ( Fig. 1b ). Deriving sample exclusion criteria. Since one of the challenges in low-biomass microbiome analyses is determining how to exclude samples, we also evaluated the read counts across controls from this comparison. The number of reads produced persample was also highly correlated with the number of input cells ( Fig. 1d ) and can thus be used as a guide for sample exclusion. When comparing the read counts of positiveand negative controls, the Mo Bio PowerMag-with-ClearMag protocol was able todistinguish down to 500 cells, which was the lowest number among the kits tested( Fig. 1d ). Upon applying the allosteric sigmoidal equation to the Mo Bio PowerMag- ClearMag samples, we determine that at K12, when 50 of the reads from the positive control mapped to the target organism, the read count was 683 ( Fig. 1e ). Thus, in the low-biomass experiment, one could exclude samples with H11021683 reads. All 24 DNA extraction negative controls had H11021683 reads, while only 1 sample from the 5-cell input and 2 samples from the 50-cell input generated at least 683 reads. Of the 500-cellinputs, 16 of the 18 samples had at least 683 reads and thus would be included in theanalysis, while all 18 samples from the 5,000-cell input produced sufcient reads forinclusion. Thus, by using read counts from positive controls paired with the composi-tion of those positive controls, one can determine a per-study limit of detection. Additional methods attempted to improve the extraction efciency or quality control (QC) were futile. More specically, it is common in molecular biology to addcarrier RNA during DNA extraction to improve the extraction efciency or yield,particularly with columns. In this experiment, adding carrier RNA did not affect recoveryand detection by the high-throughput methods and only partially increased detectionby the low-throughput method (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Gel electro-phoresis is a low-cost quality assuranceQC method typically used to test whetherenough library product was produced by a PCR or library construction for next-generation sequencing, but the effectiveness of this approach has, to our knowledge,not been assessed for modern library construction protocols and specically for low-biomass samples. Amplicon libraries from only 26 of the 72 DNA extraction positivecontrols (5-, 50-, 500-, and 5,000-cell inputs) generated a visible band in a 2 agarosegel, while 37 libraries were shown to have enough reads to be included in the analysisby the KatharoSeq exclusion method (Fig. S2b). This demonstrates that library successbased on the presence of a band in a gel has a 30 false-negativity rate and thusshould be absolutely avoided for low-biomass applications. Of the 37 successfullibraries, 1 was from a 5-cell input, 2 were from 50-cell inputs, 16 were from 500-cellinputs, and 18 out of 18 were from 5,000-cell inputs. None of the DNA extractionnegative controls showed a band in the gel, and each of these negative controlsgenerated fewer than 683 reads. From these results, we deem it unwise to utilize gelsHigh-Throughput Low-Biomass Microbiome Analysis MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 3blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub110100100010000100000 Reads per sample (deblurred) Mobio PS autoclavedMobio PSQiagen UCP Mobio PM SwiftmagMobio PMClearmag  blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub blank 5 B. sub 50 B. sub 500 B. sub 5000 B. sub0.00.20.40.60.81.0Composition of reads (target B. subtilis )       Mobio PS autoclavedMobio PSQiagen UCPMobio PM SwiftmagMobio PMClearmag 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 250000.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 Number of deblurred readsComposition of reads (target B. subtilis ) Mobio Powermag Clearmag Allosteric sigmoidal R2  0.7603 df  91 Y  Vmax  Xh(K12h  Xh) Vmax  1.026, SE - 0.05817 h  1.633, SE - 0.3049K 12  683.4, SE - 100.6 a b e0 2000 4000 60000.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 Number of input cells ( B. subtilis )Composition of reads (target B. subtilis )Mobio Powermag Clearmag Allosteric sigmoidal R2  0.9209 df  91 Y  Vmax  Xh(K12h  Xh) Vmax  1.001, SE - 0.032 h  1.351, SE - 0.2021 K12  96.88, SE 13.91 d5-5000 cells, negatives DNA extraction lysis -  cRNA DNA cleanupAutomated - HT Manual - LTCellular isolation cMinich et al.

We applied this method of exclusion to samples from the three unique cleanrooms. For the subsequent built-environment analyses, we conservatively designated oursample exclusion to be the median read count of the 5,000-cell input. This wasdetermined on the basis of positive controls for each built environment (SAF, 1,696reads; NICU and abalone-rearing facility, 2,015 reads). Values will vary from experimentto experiment primarily because of differences in overall sequencing depth and,marginally, well-to-well contamination occurring during sample collection or process-ing and thus should be calculated for each experiment and sequencing run. Applying KatharoSeq to low-biomass environments. We applied KatharoSeq amplicon sequencing to three unique low-biomass environments: the JPL SAF, an NICU, and a facility for rearing critically endangered abalone. Together with positive controlsfrom the initial low-biomass method development, a total of 1,072 samples generated25,969,842 reads representing 16,417 suboperational taxonomic units (sOTUs). We alsoprocessed, 556 samples from the three environments for shotgun metagenomics (96from the SAF, 337 from the NICU, and 123 from the abalone-rearing facility). Thesuccess rate of samples processed through the 16S rRNA amplicon pipeline (SAF, 57;NICU, 50; abalone-rearing facility, 90) was generally higher than the success rate ofthe shotgun metagenome analysis (SAF, 64; NICU, 44; abalone-rearing facility, 35). Results from the SAF cleanroom-specic microbiome highlighted the importance of using controls. For 16S rRNA analysis, the minimum exclusion of 1,696 reads wasdetermined by calculating the median read counts of the positive DNA extractioncontrols at 5,000 cells ( Fig. 1a and b). Forty-three samples yielded H110211,696 reads and were omitted from the analysis ( Fig. 1b ). KatharoSeq revealed a SAF cleanroom-specic microbiome with a distinct and interpretable spatial pattern ( Fig. 3 ). Beta diversity analysis revealed that a subset of seven samples clustered in a way that did not match the overall pattern ( Fig. 3c ), indicating a different microbial composition related to human exposure. When cross-referencing to the facility oor ( Fig. 3f , red asterisks), these primarily low-trafc and normal-trafc samples localized to the top right corner and top middle of the facility,a nonrandom pattern distinguishing them from reagent contaminants or sequencingfailures. Four sOTUs were identied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis as frequent members of the JPL SAF microbiome, present in at least 75 of the JPL oor samples.These were Paracoccus marcusii ,Mycobacterium sp.,Novosphingobium , and Acinetobac- ter lwofi .Sphingomonas sp. was also present in 70 of the JPL oor samples. This organism was identied as a common SAF core sOTU in the Kennedy Space Center(KSC), Johnson Space Center, and JPL ( 15), increasing condence in its prevalence in this type of environment. Thirty-two sOTUs were differentially abundant in the global SAF oor samples, compared to the one sOTU associated with the PCR positive controls ( Fig. 3d ). Of these 32 SAF-associated sOTUs, 4 were positively associated with high human exposure, asdetermined by differential abundance, and included A. lwofi ,Enterobacteriaceae , Caulobacteraceae , and Novosphingobium sp.( Fig. 3e ). The A. lwofi sOTU was present in the negative JPL and positive PCR controls, but the levels were orders of magnitude FIG 1 Low-biomass microbiome kit evaluation.

LT, low throughput; HT, highthroughput. (b) Libraries of 16S rRNA amplicons were sequenced, and the limit of detection of B. subtilis from DNA extraction was determined by comparing the composition of the expected target in known inputs of cells with that in negative controls by a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallistest (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR of 0.05). (c) The limit of detection of the assay and approximate background noise were determined by calculatingtheK 12value by using the allosteric sigmoidal equation on the Bacillus composition. (d) The median read counts (interquartile range) were compared against blanks by using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR of 0.05) to distinguish signal from noise. (e) Readcounts were plotted against the expected composition of the target and tted with an allosteric sigmoidal equation to describe the number ofreads where 50 of the read composition was the expected target. This was performed for DNA extraction positive controls from the Mo BioPowerMag kit, which performed the best, with a limit of detection of 50 cells.High-Throughput Low-Biomass Microbiome Analysis MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 5lower than the real signal, indicating that this result stems from a minimal amount of well-to-well contamination ( Fig. 3d ). The composition of A. lwofi , when mapped onto the two-dimensional (2D) layout of the JPL SAF, is in lower relative abundance in thetop right corner and top middle. This spatial pattern strikingly resembles the overallspatial relationship in the community level beta diversity analysis ( Fig. 3c ). Shotgun metagenomic analysis of very-low-biomass samples is very challenging, and most of the research on such samples to date has used amplicon-based techniquesor whole-genome amplied products ( 13). Our oor samples had very low DNA yields, with a mean double-stranded DNA yield of 59.4 (standard error, 9.1) pg H9262l, and 23 of the samples had DNA concentrations below the detection limit of 1 pg H9262l. We per- formed metagenomic sequencing of 96 of the 192 samples, including 50 representativeJPL SAF oor samples (based on the amplicon analysis) and 46 controls, without the useof whole-genome amplication. Analysis of the spiked controls provided condence in the assemblies of other microbes from the samples for both 16S rRNA gene analysis and shotgun metagenom-ics. As expected, for the Vibrio scheri genomic DNA (gDNA)-spiked controls, there were positive correlations among the starting genome quantity, the number of resultingsequences, and the number of assembled contigs. More than 98 of the full V. scheri genome was recovered in the assembly at a spike-in level of 5,000 copies, and 30was recovered from just 50 copies (Fig. S4). The 50 JPL SAF oor samples yielded highlyvariable numbers of sequences (mean, 3.18 H1100310 5; standard deviation, 4.63 H11003106). One air swab control, FC3, yielded 1.76 H11003105sequences, while the other three air swab controls and all three water controls yielded H110211,500 sequences. Consequently, the control swabs differed signicantly in yield. Human sequences were identied andremoved from the data set with Bowtie 2.2.9 (see Materials and Methods). Of the 50 JPLoor samples, 29 (58) contained H110211 human sequences, while 17 (34) contained 1 to 10 human sequences. Taxonomic proling results of samples with at least 10,000 FIG 2 Description of the low-biomass microbiome bench protocol and computational analysis. KatharoSeq-specic recommendations are highlighted throughout the pipeline from sample collection to bioinformatic sample exclusion.Minich et al.

Comparing the SAF environment to two other low-biomass environments. A detailed description and interpretation of all three facilities are beyond the scope of this report, but we provide a brief comparison of the SAF data with the NICU andabalone-rearing facility data to demonstrate the utility of KatharoSeq in characterizinga range of low-biomass environments and relating them to one another ( Fig. 4 ). Across the three built environments, the alpha diversity measured by microbial taxon richness was highest in the abalone-rearing facility, followed by the NICU andthen the SAF ( Fig. 4a ) (Kruskal-Wallis test statistic, 131.8; PH110210.0001). Within each of the three environments, human exposure was associated with microbial taxon richness,although some of the details differed among the environments. Floor samples, mostexposed to direct contact with humans, consistently had the highest diversity ( Fig. 4b ). In the NICU, the microbial taxon richness of keyboard, chair, and oor samples was positively associated with the human exposure of each surface. However, contrary tothis general trend, the stethoscope and incubator samples had higher microbial taxonrichness in low-exposure rooms. The reason for this apparent paradox is that stetho-scopes and incubators are sanitized each day in occupied rooms, reducing theirmicrobial diversity on a daily basis ( Fig. 4b ). At the abalone-rearing facility, the microbial taxon richness of the abalone tank wall and oor samples was negatively associated with human exposure, contrary to thegeneral trend. However, this effect might be due to characteristics of the inuence ofthe individual abalone species on their surrounding microbial environments, becausethe abalone species are physically separated from one another ( Fig. 4b ). The white abalone tanks were considered to have lower human exposure, because they arephysically separated from the other tanks. The total microbial taxon richness wasgreatest on the surface of abalone shells, followed by the foot and then the feces, whichcould have implications for understanding exposures of abalone to environmentalmicrobes ( Fig. 4b ). As expected and as a validation of the technique, the microbial community com- position differed in each low-biomass environment, as measured by 16S rRNA analysis( Fig. 4c ) and shotgun metagenome sequencing ( Fig. 4d ). The beta diversity distance of oor samples (solid-color spheres) from the other samples (transparent) within eachbuilt environment (by color) was smaller than the distances of oor samples from otherbuilt environments ( Fig. 4c ). The NICU environment, as a whole, had greater microbial richness than the JPL SAF but less than the abalone-rearing facility. Microbial richness was highest on the oor,lowest on stethoscopes and incubators, and intermediate on chairs, keyboards, andother surfaces ( Fig. 4b ). Relative to the oor, the incubator was enriched in Klebsiella and the stethoscope was enriched in Staphylococcus (Fig. S4) and Neisseriaceae .N o sOTUs were associated with acuity level or neonate occupancy when incubator, stetho-scope, and oor samples were compared. Pathogen outbreaks in hospitals are of grave concern, especially when they occur in sensitive populations such as the ICU or NICU. We were able to observe from themetagenomic data strains that were relevant to clinical increases in infection and FIG 3 Optimized KatharoSeq protocol applied to a JPL cleanroom facility.

In the months after the study, two cases of methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) invasive disease (bacteremia) were identied as an increase over baseline number of noninvasive clinical isolates of MRSA (institutionalreview board IRB number 171209X). The high-acuity F pod had six MRSA-positivecultures in 5 of the 14 rooms, while the low-acuity GH pod had only six MRSA-positivecultures across 5 of the 37 rooms (42.9 versus 23.7 incidence). In accordance withthese clinical observations, we found that samples from the F pod had larger propor-tions of Staphylococcus than those from the GH pods. Since the F pod is higher acuity, it has a higher density of health care professionals, potentially contributing a higherinput of Staphylococcus , and its rooms receive more frequent cleaning, which may maintain a harsh environment that unintentionally enriches drug-resistant bacteria.Whole-metagenome sequencing revealed that most of the staphylococcal signals wereStaphylococcus epidermidis , although S. aureus was also present. To prevent disease outbreaks and minimize patient-to-patient microbial transfer, this NICU was designed to have individual patient rooms. An outstanding question,however, is when a patient is infected, what the effect on nearby patients is. Further-more, when a patient has an infection, does this also colonize the room itself or is itconned to the person? We observed a second strain linked to a clinical event. In thedetailed survey, Serratia marcescens , a human pathogen associated with nosocomial infections and septicemia in the NICU ( 16), was highly abundant on various surfaces in room 813, including the incubator, along with various surfaces in room 811 (Fig. S3).Upon chart review, the patient in 813 developed an S. marcescens lung infection, which was conrmed by respiratory and eye cultures on 12 and 13 January, respectively. Thepatient continued to have positive cultures on 13 and 23 February 2017 after multipleadministrations of antibiotics. Finding S. marcescens in this room in multiple sample types 48 days after the initial positive culture, while not observing the organism in twoadjacent rooms, indicates the potential utility of noninvasive built-environment sam-pling for monitoring and discovering infectious agents in a clinical setting. The microbial composition of the abalone-rearing facility was distinct from that of the SAF and the NICU. The abalone-rearing facility uses a owthrough system to supplyseawater to the main aquarium, while the white abalone tanks receive UV-treated andltered seawater. Abalone hosts generally had species-specic microbiomes from thefeces, the foot, and the shell (Fig. S4). When comparing microbial communities bypresence or absence by using unweighted UniFrac distances, the red and whiteabalone body sites clustered more closely with built-environment samples taken fromthe respective red and white abalone tanks (Fig. S4a). Further, the pink, green, andwhite abalone fecal communities were more closely related than red abalone fecalcommunities. However, some replicates from the white abalone foot and shell mirroredthat of the environment, suggesting a more transient community (Fig. S4a and b). Themost abundant sOTU in the abalone aquarium microbiome was a Vibrio sp. (Fig. S4c). Spatially, this Vibrio sOTU was present across the entire facility and highly abundant in the fecal material from all of the abalone species sampled (Fig. S4c). Shotgun metag-enome analysis revealed several potential Vibrio spp. present across the communities, with Vibrio breoganii followed by Vibrio tasmaniensis making up the majority (Fig. S4d). The other most common microbes in the facility were Psychrilyobacter ,Pseudoaltero- monas ,Colwelliaceae , and Leucothrix , providing a microbiome markedly different from that of the other two environments sampled ( Fig. 4d ). The pathogen responsible for causing withering syndrome ( 12) was not detected in the facility or associated with the abalone hosts. DISCUSSION The KatharoSeq protocol integrates positive and negative controls, specic choices of high-throughput DNA extraction and bead cleanup kits, library construction andpooling strategies for amplicon sequencing or shotgun metagenomics, and bioinfor-matic sample exclusion protocols to achieve a high-throughput, sensitive, and specicmethod of probing low-biomass microbiomes. By utilizing high-throughput extractionMinich et al. MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 10methods, one can perform 384 DNA extractions with a single EpMotion robot paired with four KingFisher robots in 6 h, compared to processing around 72 samples per 6 hby low-throughput methods. We emphasize that positive controls both before andafter DNA extraction are required, using spike-ins of different organisms so thatdifferent contamination sources can be detected and controlled. Specically, we rec-ommend having at least 24 total positive and 12 negative DNA extraction controls perproject with at least 8 and 4 per 96-well plate. Positive controls processed before DNAextraction assess DNA extraction efciency, provide detection limits in terms of theminimum number of cells, and reveal DNA extraction kit or sample processing con-taminants. For each sequencing run, we also recommend having at least 24 to 48 PCRpositive controls (12 to 24 single strain and 12 to 24 mock community) along with 8 PCRnegative controls. The PCR positive controls should be a serial dilution of gDNA downto subgenome copies. Positive controls spiked before PCR amplication reveal detec-tion limits at the PCR step, help quantify contaminants in PCR master mix reagents, andallow estimation of input DNA concentrations ( Fig. 1 ). We were able to easily differentiate samples from the three environments tested, and in all three cases, the shotgun metagenomic results provided a second line ofevidence obtained from amplicon sequencing. For the rst study, we describe thebiogeography of a SAF used to construct equipment such as the Mars rovers, which hasultralow-microbial-biomass requirements. In the JPL SAF, we were able to conrm thata very plausible microbe that frequently contaminates other cleanrooms was present inthis facility. A. lwofi was the most common microbe found in the JPL SAF, consistent with the previous report that Acinetobacter was described at low levels ( H110215) in the JPL SAF and at higher levels (2 to 33) at KSC ( 15).Acinetobacter is a frequent cleanroom contaminant because it resists sterilization procedures and disinfectants and is alsofrequently reported as an aerosolized infectious agent in hospitals ( 17). In the shotgun metagenomic analysis, A. lwofi did not show up in the k-mer prole because the genome of A. lwofi was not in the default Kraken database, but alignments directly with the reference genome conrmed its presence. On the basis of the metagenomicapproach, we also detected multiple fungal and viral groups, which is beyond thescope of standard 16S rRNA amplicon protocols. Only the careful selection of positivecontrols in the KatharoSeq protocol allows condence in the identication of clean-room microbes while controlling for kit and sample processing contaminants. Byrealizing the species level resolution and comparison across spatially diverse samples,we can begin to understand the origin and sources of strains in a cleanroom or hospitalsetting and engineer systems that eliminate these organisms. The largest hospital microbiome study to date ( 7) suggests that the microbial communities of patient rooms are most inuenced by the original microbes of thepatients themselves. Because the neonates in the NICU do not yet have establishedmicrobiomes, we suspect that the skin-associated microbes found in the NICU areinstead from health care professionals or parents. Supporting this observation, nosOTUs were associated with acuity level or neonate occupancy. Currently, methods forpathogen monitoring are restricted to patient samples that are sent for culturing only.Being able to monitor and predict pathogen occurrences by routine culture-independent noninvasive sampling of the built environment could be a useful ap-proach for preventing outbreaks by identifying compromised or infected patients orpotential hot spots of transmission. Future work should aim to establish baseline MRSAskin or nasal colonization rates of neonates and relate to infection rates. Standardizedprocedures need to be developed to eliminate sampling biases for sampling micro-biomes paired with clinical culturing. Finding S. marcescens , a human pathogen asso- ciated with nosocomial infections and septicemia in the NICU ( 16), in a specic NICU room in multiple sample types 48 days after the initial positive culture but not in twoadjacent rooms indicates the utility of KatharoSeq for biosurveillance monitoring.Similarly, aquaculture facilities often employ costly engineering controls to minimizeintraunit pathogen transfer from humans, but our results suggest that most microbesin a cleanroom aquarium likely originate from the water or marine animals rather thanHigh-Throughput Low-Biomass Microbiome Analysis MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 11humans. Each Vibrio species we observed has only been recently discovered. V. breoga- niiis a mollusk-associated, nonmotile, alginolytic marine bacterium within the Vibrio halioticoli clade ( 18,19), and V. tasmaniensis was isolated from sh ( 19). Several Vibrio species have been identied as molluscan pathogens ( 18), and further studies should therefore be conducted to elucidate the symbiotic or pathogenic role of these specieswithin abalone. By establishing that abalone have species-specic microbial commu-nities with a large core of taxa shared with their environment, future studies should beaimed at understanding how perturbing the built environment can inuence hostmicrobiomes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the KatharoSeq protocol provides compelling microbial community analyses down to limits of detection of 50 to 500 cellsin a high-throughput setting. It enables low-biomass investigations in a wide range ofareas. The total processing time from when biological samples are received to whensequencing data are obtained is approximately 48 h ( 20). The pipeline can be easily scaled to increase throughput, because multiple steps, including plate loading, DNAextraction, PCR, and sequencing, can be automated by using robotic liquid handlers. Inparticular, high-throughput analysis of epidemiological cohorts of banked plasmasamples and household dust samples improved the detection and control of microbialcontamination in semiconductor and spacecraft fabrication settings, including plane-tary protection applications, and forensic analysis of degraded or minuscule sampleswill greatly benet from the utilization of this high-throughput, scalable protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS Kit comparisons. An isolate of B. subtilis 3610 cultivated at 37C overnight was sorted by ow cytometry on a Sony SH800Z FACS by using SYBR green uorescence, isolating 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 cellsin a sterile 0.22- H9262m-ltered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. DNA extractions from each set of sorted cells were performed in triplicate with and without carrier RNA (Thermo, Fisher catalog no.4382878) with manual single-tube DNA extraction kits (Mo Bio PowerSoil, where the consumables wereautoclaved fo r3h 21, and the Qiagen Ultra Clean kit) ( Fig. 1a ) .A1 -H9262g sample of carrier RNA was added to samples after lysis. Negative controls of the PBS with and without carrier RNA along with completeblanks were DNA extracted in triplicate alongside the positive controls as well. These single-tube manualprotocols were compared to the high-throughput DNA isolation protocols adopted from the EarthMicrobiome Project by using the same cultures of B. subtilis (nH110059) with and without carrier RNA along with negative controls of PBS ( nH1100512) and blanks ( nH1100512) with the EpMotion 5075 liquid-handling robot (for the initial lysis steps), followed by the KingFisher Flex robot (bead-based DNA extraction). Twodifferent bead cleanup protocols, Swiftmag beads and ClearMag beads, were tested ( Fig. 1a ). All extracted DNA was amplied in triplicate for 35 PCR cycles with a 5- H9262l input in a 25- H9262l reaction mixture volume with the Earth Microbiome Project standard 16S V4 515f806rB bar-coded primers ( 22, 23). These amplicons were pooled and run on 2 agarose gel and quantied with PicoGreen to access quality and relative quantity. Samples with no visible band were pooled at equal volumes of 20 H9262l; otherwise, samples were pooled at 50 ng per sample for a total sample volume of up to 20 H9262l. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq at 2 H11003150 bp by using paired-end reads. Bioinformatic processing of samples was conducted in Qiita with QIIME v1.9.1 ( 24) with the rst read trimmed to 150 bp and then processed with deblur ( 25), ade novo sOTU picking method. For phylogenetics-based distance comparisons of the microbiomes, a tree was constructed from the sOTUs with SEPP (SAT-EnabledPhylogenetic Placement; https:github.comsmirarabseppblobmastersepptree.py ), and then results were visualized in EMPeror ( 26). Sample communities were then annotated with Greengenes. The per-sample read counts generated after demultiplexing were used to compare false-negativity rates forusing a gel to qualify low-biomass libraries (Fig. S2). The reference hit biom table was generated withdeblur ( 25). The counts of all sOTUs generated from the deblur biom table were summed to determine the number of reads per sample. To determine if read counts could be used as a proxy to measurestarting biomass and thus estimate sample success for other samples, read counts from positive DNAextraction controls were compared against blanks by using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with aBenjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 ( Fig. 1b ). The proportion of sequences aligning with Bacillus was measured in each sample group and also compared in the same method ( Fig. 1d ). Samples from the top-performing kit were then selected to compare read counts against microbialcomposition and tted with an allosteric sigmoidal equation that determines the read number at which50 of the reads align with the correct target, Bacillus ( Fig. 1c ). This was repeated again for comparing input cell counts to composition to determine the absolute limit of detection of the process ( Fig. 1e ). On the basis of these results, we have outlined the steps needed to perform a low-biomass microbiomeanalysis that includes controls at each step of the processing paired with bioinformatic analysis forsample exclusion based on read counts ( Fig. 2 ). We applied this method to the 16S rRNA amplicon data from the three unique built environments. Sample exclusion was conservatively calculated and appliedfor each data set by removing samples that had less than the median read count of 5,000-cell positivecontrols. The success rate of 16S rRNA amplicon analysis across the three built environments wasMinich et al. MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 12determined by the proportion of samples with read counts greater than the median read counts of the 5,000-cell positive controls. This is a conservative estimate of success, as we were able to detect positive controls down to 50 cells and thus could use the median read counts at 50 cells. Since fewer positivecontrols were used for the shotgun metagenome analysis, we determined success by the proportion ofprimary samples with read counts great than the median read counts of the negative controls. Alphadiversity (microbial richness expressed as the number of observed sOTUs) and beta diversity (unweightedand weighted UniFrac distances  27) were calculated with Qiime v1.9.1. Beta diversity and principal- component analysis (PCoA) plots for the shotgun metagenomes were calculated by using the Bray-Curtisdistance matrix ( 28). JPL SAF sample collection and processing. Patches of surface in an ISO class 7 cleanroom at the JPL SAF in Pasadena, CA, were collected on 31 August 2016 with ultraclean water-moistened sterileswabs. Each patch was 25 cm 2. Prior to sampling, technicians donned cleanroom garments and two sets of people were dispatched to collect samples from the JPL SAF where most of the Mars 2020 spacecraftcomponents will be assembled. Each set of technicians consisted of two members, one of whom activelycollected samples from JPL SAF surfaces while the other carefully cut the swab heads with a sterilescalpel after sample collection. One set of technicians collected samples from 50 surfaces, and a secondset of technicians sampled another 50 JPL SAF surfaces. Immediately after samples were obtained, vialscontaining sample swabs were frozen at H1100280C and sent to the University of California San Diego (UCSD) via frozen shipment. Negative controls consisted of dry swabs exposed to air in the facility for theduration of a typical sampling event, and the same molecular-grade water was used to wet the swabs. NICU sampling. Patches of surface (25 cm 2) in the NICU of the recently built (5-month-old) Jacobs Medical Center were sampled with swabs on 1 March 2017 as described in the JPL SAF facility protocol.Broad sampling of the inside of the incubator, the stethoscope surface (15 cm 2), and the oor near the bed was done throughout all 52 patient rooms in two wings of the hospital, for a total of 156 samples.Each wing of the hospital was of either high acuity (rooms 801 to 814) or low acuity (rooms 815 to 852),where the patient-to-nurse ratio varied from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1, respectively. In each of the two wings, fourreplicate locations within the primary nursing station were sampled, including the chair seat, table,keyboard, and oor, for a total of 16 samples per nursing station or 32 samples overall. An additional 21samples were collected in seven of the rooms for a more detailed survey of the oor, surfaces, incubator,and parent chair microbial communities. The seven rooms included two in the low-acuity wing (837 and838) and ve in the high-acuity wing (801, 802, 806, 813, and 814). Rooms 801 and 802 were bothconsidered negative-pressure rooms and are used for quarantine purposes. Within each wing, roomswere chosen to be approximately the same distance from the nursing station while varying in occupancy,as noted by the black silhouette of a baby in the image. Within the patient room, the six surfacesswabbed included an air vent, a nurses chair, a nurses keyboard, a feeding pump or heating device, asink, and the opening of the diaper trash can. Six surfaces of the parents chair included the two armlocations, seat, back, top, and behind that would not be in contact with visitors. In addition to theincubator sample taken from the inside near the head position across all 52 rooms, an additional threesamples were swabbed within the incubator at the hands and feet, along with one swab from the outsidethat would not be in contact with a neonate. The additional oor samples were taken from each cornerof the room along with the rst step inside the doorway. Statistical analyses of the 16S rRNA ampliconand shotgun metagenome data were performed as described in Materials and Methods. The 388 sampleswere processed by the high-throughput methods and then 16S rRNA amplicon sequenced. Further, 337samples processed through the high-throughput KatharoSeq protocol were processed for shotgunmetagenome sequencing. Southwest Fisheries Science Center abalone research aquarium sampling. Abalone-rearing facility samples were taken on 14 and 24 February 2017 at a total of 159 sampling points, including 68abalone-associated and 91 facility- or tank-associated samples (Fig. S4). Within the facility, seawater isltered to remove larger (50- to 100- H9262m) particles, UV treated, and then ozonated to remove and destroy microbes from the water before deployment to animal tanks. Ten individual white abalone wereweighed, measured for length, sexed, and then swabbed on the foot and shell, and four fecal detrituspellets were removed from the tank, for a total of 24 white abalone samples. Eight red abalone wereswabbed on the foot and shell, and eight fecal pellets were collected from the bottom of the tank, foranother 24 samples. Five green abalone fecal pellets were collected, and ve fecal pellets were collectedfrom three different pink abalone tanks. Each of the three pink abalone tanks represented animals thathad undergone oxytetracycline antibiotic treatments at various times in the past (1 day, 90 days, or3 years). Forty-one facility samples included 18 oor samples taken at two time points along with a doorhandle, two skimmer locations, and two table surfaces. Twenty-seven samples were taken from the whiteabalone tank, including ve bottom, four turf liner, four wall, ve PVC pipe, one air hose, four water, andfour kelp food samples. Twenty-three samples were swabbed from the red abalone tank, including fourtank lip (not touching water), two PVC pipe, four air stone, ve water, four wall, and four kelp samples.All samples were processed through the KatharoSeq protocol, with equal volumes pooled and processedfor 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. The work involving white abalone at theSouthwest Fisheries Science Center was permitted under ESA permit no. 14344-2R issued to J. Hyde.Sample swabbing occurred concurrent with regular husbandry and health assessment monitoring thattogether was deemed a de minimus activity and did not require IACUC approval. DNA extraction. On the basis of the protocol testing results, DNA extraction was performed in accordance with the KatharoSeq protocol (Mo Bio PowerMag kit with ClearMag beads) and quantieddown to 1 pg H9262l with the Qubit (Thermo, Fisher). DNA-positive controls consisted of B. subtilis ow sorted into 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 cells ( nH110053 each). Blanks with no cells were also included.High-Throughput Low-Biomass Microbiome Analysis MayJune 2018 Volume 3 Issue 3 e00218-17 msystems.asm.org 13Amplicon library construction. 16S rRNA amplicon PCR amplication was performed as described in the KatharoSeq protocol in Fig. 2 , with all amplicons pooled at equal volumes of 20 H9262l and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at 2 H11003150-bp paired-end reads. Sample volumes were equally pooled regardless of the presence of an amplicon band to reduce false negatives (Fig. S2) and as a comparative measureof the relative starting DNA biomass. PCR positive controls consisted of V. scheri at 0.1 to 500,000 genome copies (estimated by Qubit DNA concentration). Internal transcribed spacer PCR amplicationwith bar-coded primers ITS1fITS2 was also performed, but all samples failed to produce any detectablelibrary and thus were not sequenced. Amplicon data analyses. De novo sOTU picking was performed in Qiita (qiita.microbio.me) and QIIME as described above. Microbial richness was measured by determining the number of observedsOTUs per sample. The mean compositions of highly abundant OTUs from the QIIME analysis of the JPLSAF oor samples and across the various positive and negative controls are summarized in Fig. S3. Finer-grained de novo sequence analysis was performed by deblur ( 25) and visualized in Calour (http:github.comamnonacalour ), providing single-nucleotide polymorphism resolution (Fig. S3). Mi- crobial diversity was calculated by determining the total number of observed sOTUs per sample.Differential abundances of JPL SAF oor microbes were compared to JPL positive controls by using apermutation-based group mean comparison with the FDR controlled to 0.05 by using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure ( 29) within Calour (Fig. S3). Spatial mapping was performed with ili, a toolbox for molecular mapping in two and three dimensions ( 30)(Fig. 3d ). To evaluate a deeper taxonomic resolution on the JPL SAF samples, we processed the JPL plates through the Kapa Hyper Plus library prepprotocol. Only one of the two plates had enough DNA after library preparation to load onto the HiSeqRapid Run 2 H11003250-bp run. Shotgun metagenomic data analyses. The sequencing data were processed through Trimmomatic 0.36 ( 31) to trim off low-quality reads and Bowtie 2.2.9 ( 32) against human reference genome assembly GRCh38 to remove potential human contamination. Taxonomic proling was conducted with Kraken0.10.5 ( 33) against a database that contains all of the complete genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database under the categories bacteria, archaea, viral, protozoa, fungi, and human as of November 2016. Relativeabundances of taxa were computed by dividing the sequences assigned to this taxon against the totalnumber of processed sequences. Selected V. scheri gDNA-spiked samples were subjected to de novo assembly with SPAdes 3.9 ( 34). The resulting contigs were qualied with QUAST 4.3 ( 35) and further scaffolded with Ragout 1.2 ( 36) against the V. scheri ES114 reference genome (RefSeq accession no. GCF_000011805.1). The resulting draft genomes were aligned with the reference genome by using Brig0.95 ( 37). Default parameter settings were used for these programs unless otherwise stated. Data availability.
