E-mail: robferlufl.edu Current address: Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom Introduction Long duration human missions to Mars must rely on more than just stored supplies and physico-chemical means to regenerate airand clean water. The Advanced Life Support (ALS) scenarios envisioned for extended manned missions will depend upon the efficient use of local planetary resources and the recycling of limitedmaterials such as water, pressurized atmosphere, and organic matter, while producing food to augment supplies 1. The use of in situ regolith for plant growth in a future bioregenerative life support system on Mars may have several advantages over hydroponicsystems 2,3. These include the immediate bioavailability of plant essential ions, low-tech mechanical support for plants, and easy access to in situ materials once on the surface. However, plant growth may be reduced or inhibited by phytotoxic substances in the regolith, such as high levels of soluble magnesium sulfate minerals. Hydrated forms of magnesium sulfate such as MgSO 4?7H2O (epsomite) and MgSO 4?H2O (kieserite) have been detected in several regions by the Mars Express Satellite 4,5,6. Analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover landers at Meridiani Planum and Gusev crater have also indicated the presence of high levels of magnesium sulfate minerals (up to 10 wt) in outcrops and soils 7,8,9. PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 August 2010  Volume 5  Issue 8  e12348High levels of hydrated sulfate minerals in regolith on Mars used in bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg2and SO422ions in the soil solution. Plants may have evolved to cope with relatively high levels of elements in the soil environment by limiting internal accumulation or tolerating high internal concen-trations 10. In a potential bioregenerative life support system on Mars, an excess of a particular element in the crews diet could affect the availability of other required elements. This study therefore first determined whether knockout mutant lines for genes encoding certain transporters responsible for uptake of Mg 2and SO422ions in roots could enhance plant tolerance to high levels of magnesium sulfate in the growth medium and then moved to a molecular analysis of the responses to Mg2and SO 422in order to increase the potential pool of candidate genes. Various efforts have previously illustrated that the disabling of transporter genes can indeed improve tolerance to certain elements. For example, a line of transgenic wheat plants expressing an antisense construct of the high affinity Ktransporter TaHKT2;1 showed reduced sodium uptake by roots and enhanced growth relative to unstressed plants compared to a control line at high levels of NaCl in the growth medium 11. Several plasma membrane localized proteins in the outer cell layers of Arabidopsis roots are known to be responsible for magnesium or sulfate ion uptake. Two specific genes, AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2 , were chosen for this study, in part because of their localization and because of availability of knockout lines. AtMRS2-10 (AtMGT1 ) functionally complemented a bacterial mutant lacking Mg2transport capability and AtMRS2-10-GFP expressing plants showed fluorescence in the periphery of root cells, suggesting a plasma membrane association 12. AtMRS2-10 is, to date, the only member of the AtMRS2 family that is known to be associated to the plasma membrane of root cells in addition to having Mg2ion transport capability. Therefore, a knockout mutant line of the AtMRS2-10 gene ( mrs 2-10 ) was characterized for this study based on the SALK_100361.41.30.x T-DNA insertion line 13. AtSULTR1;2 is a constitutively expressed sulfate transporter gene whose product AtSULTR1;2 is localized in root hair, epidermal and cortical cells where it ensures sulfate uptake into plants under sulfur-replete conditions 14. A knockoutmutant line of the AtSULTR1;2 gene ( sel1-10 ) was shown to take up 80 less sulfate than wildtype when grown for 12 days on agar with optimal levels (1.7 mM MgSO 4?7H2O) of sulfate 15. Knockout lines of genes encoding vacuolar HCa2transport- ers CAX1 and CAX3 were also analyzed to present perspective of other, non-plasma membrane, cellular transporter locations. The cax1-1 and cax1cax3 lines were previously shown to be more tolerant of high Mg2levels in the form of MgCl 2when grown on agar 16,17. In a separate study, a CAX1 knockout mutant was identified through a mutant screen on nutrient solutions reflecting low Ca:Mg ratios characteristic of serpentine soils 18. When high MgSO 4?7H2O concentrations are applied, the Ca:Mg ratio of the nutrient solution decreases, which therefore makes the cax1-1 and cax1cax3 mutants candidates for high magnesium sulfate tolerance. This study determined whether enhanced tolerance to low Ca:Mg ratios is maintained when cax1-1 and cax1cax3 mutants are exposed to elevated SO 422in addition to elevated Mg2in soil medium. These candidate genes for enhanced magnesium sulfate tolerance that are presented above were selected based on previous literature describing the results of individual gene or gene family analyses. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of plants exposed to elevated concentrations of magnesium, sulfate, or magnesium sulfate in the growth medium have not beenreported to date. In order to increase the number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing growth performance ofplants exposed to this abiotic stress, root transcriptome remodelingin Col-0 was analyzed after short-term (45 min.) hydroponicexposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO 4?7H2O. This early time point was chosen to capture part of the primarystress responses. The differential expression of transporter geneswas analyzed after 90 min. and 180 min. in addition to 45 min.,as this group in particular may represent a metabolic strategy fortolerance to an elevated magnesium sulfate environment. The roottranscriptome of the transporter gene knockout mutant cax1-1 was furthermore contrasted with that of Col-0 after both genotypeswere exposed to MgSO 4?7H2O treatment for 180 min. Based on their previously identified tolerance to high MgCl 2and low Ca:Mg ratios, cax1mutants are likely to show enhanced growth compared to wildtype when exposed to high magnesium sulfate levels.Furthermore, ionome analyses of cax1 mutants showed that they have significantly reduced levels of Mg 2in their leaves compared to wildtype 18.The cax1cax3 double knockout mutant, while having the potential to show tolerance to elevated MgSO 4?7H2O based on its tolerance to MgCl 2and its reduced shoot levels of Mg2, showed significant differences in concentration of multiple elements, and grew more slowly than wildtype under regularnutrient conditions 17. Since cax1-1 mutants did not display negative effects on growth under regular nutrient conditions, cax1- 1rather than cax1cax3 was included in the root transcriptome analysis. Genes differentially regulated between cax1-1 and Col-0 grown under stress conditions could reveal those molecularprocesses possibly leading to significant differences in growthperformance at the whole plant level. A hydroponic medium waschosen to mimic root exposure to a specific soil solution in order to directly link transcriptome responses to the level of bioavailable ions that roots may experience in a hypothetical root zone of aregolith profile on Mars 19. The treatment concentration ofMgSO 4?7H2O was based on the low Ca:Mg ratio that can occur in serpentine soils on Earth. Because of their high amount ofbioavailable magnesium, Serpentine soils can be seen as a partialanalogue for regolith high in magnesium sulfate on Mars 20. Materials and Methods Mrs2-10 T-DNA Insertion Line Characterization A homozygous knockout T-DNA insertion line for AtMRS2-10 (At1g80900) was identified by PCR and RT-PCR using theoriginal SALK_100361.41.30.x line (Fig. 1a,b). For PCR,oligonucleotide primers MRS2-10_LP (5 9-CAGGATCAAAG- CATCGTTCTC-3 9) and MRS2-10_RP (5 9-TAGGAGCTCA- GAAGACGCAAC-3 9) were designed using software available on the Salk Institute website (http:signal.salk.edutdnaprimers.html). In addition, the T-DNA specific primer LBb1 (5 9- GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3 9) was included as de- signed and recommended by the Salk Institute. Combinations ofthe primers were used to identify plants for which the T-DNAinsertion was present in both AtMRS2-10 alleles. Genomic DNAwas extracted from T-DNA insertion mutant leaves using theShorty method. For this method, 500 uL Shorty Buffer (0.2 MTris-HCL pH 9.0, 0.4 M LiCl, 25 mM EDTA, and 1 SDS) wasadded to ground leaf tissue ( ,0.25 cm 2) in a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then spun for 5 min. at high speed in amicrocentrifuge. Supernatant (350 uL) was transferred to a newtube containing isopropanol (350 uL). The two volumes weremixed by inversion and the tube was spun for 10 min. at top speedin a microcentrifuge. After this, the liquid was discarded and thepellet was air-dried before being resuspended in 100 uL TE buffer.Arabidopsis in Mars-Like MgSO4 PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 2 August 2010  Volume 5  Issue 8  e12348Genomic DNA was extracted from Col-0 leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using JumpStart Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma). PCR products were separated in agarose gels and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain(Invitrogen). A confirmed homozygous T-DNA insertion mutantwas backcrossed to Col-0 three times before allowing self-fertilization. Homozygous plants backcrossed 3 6were identified by PCR and used for seed generation. For RT-PCR, RNA wasextracted from leaves of Col-0 and a homozygous T-DNAinsertion line for AtMRS2-10 (At80900) with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Gene specific oligonucleotide primers MRS2- 10_LP1 (5 9-AGGGTTACTTTGTCGGAGA-3 9) and MRS2- 10_RP1 (5 9-TACACGGGGTTTTATCTTG-3 9) were designed based on Arabidopsis genomic DNA sequence information(NCBI). Alpha-( a)-Tubulin was used as a constitutive control with primers according to Yoshimoto (2002). RT-PCR was carried outusing the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR products wereseparated in agarose gels and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). An ionome analysis of the backcrossed homozygous AtMRS2-10 knockout mutants ( mrs2-10 ) was per- formed as part of the Purdue Ionomics project and results areavailable online through the Purdue Ionomics InformationManagement System (http:www.ionomicshub.orghomePiiMS) 21. Plant Growth Experiments on Soil Medium Seeds from the Ws, Col-0, mrs2-10 ,sel1-10 15, cax1-1 16 and cax1cax3 17 lines were sterilized by soaking them for 15 minutes in a 40 (vv) bleach solution with a drop of Tween 20 (polyoxyethylenesorbitanmonolaureate). The seeds were then washed six times with sterilized (autoclaved) water. To control forenvironmental variation when comparing plant growth perconcentration, each tray was divided in 8 sections of 6 wellseach, with either a mutant line or its associated wildtypebackground line planted in one section, in alternating fashion.This method resulted in 4 sections per seed line per tray. Theseeds were evenly planted (5 seeds per tray well) on the soil medium (sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite and perlite) that waswetted with nutrient solution. The basic and control nutrient solution consisted of 2.2 gL Murashige and Skoog salts (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 gL MES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). For thetreatments, MgSO 4?7H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the basic solution at 20, 60, 80 or 100 mM concentration. The pH ofthe solutions was adjusted to 5.705.75 with KOH. The trayswith soil were covered with plastic wrap to maintain sufficienthumidity and placed in a cold room at 4 uC for three days. After stratification, the trays were moved to a growth room at 23 uC where they were randomly placed on the growth benches. There, the seeds germinated, the plastic wrap was removed after 35days, and the surviving plants were thinned to two plants per well(maximum of 12 plants per section) after one week to maintainsufficient spacing. The plants were sub-irrigated twice a week,alternatively with tap water and the appropriate nutrient solution.The plants were analyzed at week 4 and the experiment wasrepeated three times. Growth Performance Measurements and Statistical Analysis Fresh weight biomass of plants grown on soil was measured by grouping and weighing whole shoots of plants per tray section.Leaf chlorophyll content of plants grown on soil medium wasmeasured with a Minolta SPAD-502 meter. One leaf measure-ment per plant per tray well was taken. Biomass or chlorophylllevels of wildtype and knockout mutant Arabidopsis lines wereevaluated in a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model usingSAS 9.2 and JMP Genomics 7 software. Genotype and concentration were included in the ANOVA model as fixed effects, while batch (replication set) was included as a randomeffect. Unbiased estimates of biomass or chlorophyll levels (least-square means) were generated for each effect (genotype,concentration, or genotype and concentration) per experiment.The estimated levels of biomass or chlorophyll were thencompared using a series of t-tests, generating estimated differencesand corresponding p-values. Differences with associated p-values ,0.05 were considered significant. Results of the ANOVA analysis are presented in Table S1. Figure 1.

Glasscontainers (2.6 L) were covered with opaque black plastic sheeting along the glass, and with opaque plastic lids across the top. In each opaque plastic lid, 18 holes (d  1.43 cm) were made at regular intervals with a hole puncher. A 2-cm-long Rockwool (Grodan) plug (d  1.59 cm) was placed in each hole. Containers were filled with a nutrient solution adjusted to pH 5.7 by KOH that was replaced once a week. It consisted of distilled water, 0.25 gLMES buffer, and 132x MS salts during week 1 and 2, while the concentration of MS salts increased to 116x during week 3. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and stratified before planting about ten seeds per Rockwool plug. Col-0 seeds were planted on 18 containers while cax1-1 seeds were planted on 6. Containers were covered with transparent plastic wrap during the first 35 days of germination. Holes were made in the plastic wrap after 13days depending on the general atmospheric humidity. The containers were randomly placed over 3 benches (8 containers bench). Air was supplied to the roots by one 3W air pump per 8 containers; each container had an airstone made from glass beads. After one week, seedlings were thinned to one seedling per Rockwool plug, so that every container supported 18 plants (Fig. 2a). At day 21, Col-0 and cax1-1 roots were exposed to the basic nutrient solution (0.25 gL MES, 116x MS, pH 5.7) with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca:Mg ra- tio  1:15). Col-0 was exposed for 45 min., 90 min., or 180 min., while cax1-1 was exposed for 180 min. only. The Col-0 control set received no extra magnesium sulfate and was harvested at 45 min.together with the first Col-0 treatment set. Four replicate containers were harvested for the control and each of the treatment sets (Fig. 2b). Roots were cut below the Rockwool plug and pooled per container before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC. Microarray Procedures, Statistical Analysis and Data display RNA was extracted from root samples with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were weighed while still frozen and reagents were adjusted to the total measured weight for the grinding and lysing step. Two replicate extractions were completed per sample with lysate volumes corresponding to 100 mg frozen wet weight each. The remainder of a sample was stored at 280uC as cleared lysate according to the Qiagen protocol. The quality and quantity of the extracted RNA was checked with denaturing agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA from each sample was amplified and labeled with cy3 dye by using AgilentQuick Amp labeling kit, one color. A total of 20 samples were hybridized to five 4 644k Arabidopsis microarray slides (Agilent), which were then washed and scanned before data was extracted. Microarray handling and data extraction was done at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida according to the One-Color Microarray- Based Gene Expression Analysis (Quick Amp Labeling) Protocol (version 5.7). Median signal intensities were quantile normalized using R software. Log2 transformed normalized data were evaluated using a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model Figure 2.

Unbiased, least squaremeans estimates of transcript abundance were generated and geneexpression measured in each treatment was then compared to acontrol using a series of t-tests; Col-0 sets treated for 45 min.,90 min., or 180 min were compared to the Col-0 set exposed to acontrol solution for 45 min., and these three comparisons arereferred to in the text, tables and figures as Time 45, Time 90, andTime 180 respectively (Fig. 3). In addition, the cax1-1 set treated for 180 min. was compared to the Col-0 set treated for 180 min.(Fig. 3). The p-values generated in these comparisons werecorrected for multiple testing by controlling the False DiscoveryRate (FDR) with the Q-value procedure in the Q-value 1.0package (default settings) of the R software 26. A default q-valuethreshold of 0.05 was used to declare a significant difference ingene expression between treatment and control. The results of theANOVA analysis are presented in Table S2. Lists of genes withstatistically significant changes in expression were further orga-nized, analyzed and displayed in tables and figures using JMPGenomics 7, R software, GeneVenn, GOstat, Cluster 3.0, JavaTreeView 1.1.4r5, the National Center for BiotechnologyInformation (NCBI) BLAST tool, and the Arabidopsis Informa- tion Resource (TAIR) Motif analysis tool. Quantitative Real-time PCR Wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown hydroponically for 21 days as described above. At day 21, four containers received a replacement of the basic nutrient solution (0.25 gL MES, 1 16x MS, pH5.7), while another four containers received the basic solution with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca:Mg ratio  1:15). Roots of treatment and control plants were exposed for 180 min. before being harvested per container. RNA was extracted and checked for quality and quantity as described above. RNA from these independently grown plants exposed or unexposed for 180 min., as well as RNA from plants exposed for 180 min. and unexposed for 45 min. in the microarray experi- ment, were used for the quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analyses. Q- PCR was performed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). 1 ug of total RNA was reverse transcribed per sample for a total of three control and three treatment samples. Primers were designed for 5 genes using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1). At2g32170 was chosen as a stably expressing reference gene appropriate for abiotic stress treatment 27. Each template primer pair combination was run in triplicate. The relative increase or decrease of mRNA abundance between the two sample sets was calculated by using the Pfaffl method, and statistical analysis of the results was done with the REST 2008 2.0.7 software. Results Plant Growth Performance The growth performance of transporter gene knockout mutant lines and their respective wildtype backgrounds grown for four weeks on soil treated with MgSO 4?7H2O in solution (0100 mM) was compared on the basis of shoot fresh weight (FW) biomass and leaf chlorophyll levels. Figure 4 shows the growth habit of mrs2-10 and sel1-10 plants compared to wildtype in the left hand panels, and of cax1-1 and cax1cax3 compared to wildtype in the right- hand panels. Statistical analysis of the FW shoot biomass of wildtype Arabidopsis (Ws, Col-0) with ANOVA confirmed the significant phytotoxic effects of increasing concentrations of dissolved MgSO 4?7H2O on wildtype plant growth (Table S1). Subsequent ANOVA analyses assessed whether selected mutant Figure 3. Overview of the microarray experiment.

Results showed that FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content of mrs2-10 and sel1-10 lines were indistinguishable from that of wildtype at the tested concentrations (Fig. 5ad, Table S1). Ionome analysis of the mrs2-10 mutant exposed to regular nutrient conditions furthermore did not reveal a statistically different leaf Mg content compared to Col-0 (http:www.ionomicshub.org homePiiMS). Although there was little difference between themrs2-10 and sel1-10 lines and their respective wild-type back- grounds, the cax1-1 and cax1cax3 lines showed relative improve- ment in their ability to grow on MgSO 4?7H2O enriched soil. Cax1- 1plants had significantly higher FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content than Col-0 grown at 80 and 100 mMMgSO 4?7H2O (Fig. 5e,g, Table S1). The increase in cax1-1 shootbiomass over that of Col-0 was 89 and 149 at 80 and 100 mM respectively. The CAX1 knockout mutation did not fully eliminate the effects of high magnesium sulfate on plant growth perfor-mance; the absolute FW shoot biomass of cax1-1 grown on soil for four weeks was still low (20) compared to untreated Col-0 (Fig 5e). Cax1cax3 plants showed significantly higher leaf chlorophyll content than Col-0 grown at 80, and 100 mM, but the average FW shoot biomass increases of 26.8 and 33.2, at80 and 100 mM, were not found to be statistically significant (Fig. 5f,h, Table S1). The significant differences in FW shoot biomass and leaf chlorophyll content between cax1cax3 and Col-0 grown at 0 mM MgSO 4?7H2O were described in detail by Cheng et al. (2005). In this study, 0 mM was only included as a point ofreference for the high concentrations of MgSO 4?7H2O. Figure 4. Overview of the Arabidopsis growth experiment on soil. Mutant lines are grown alongside their respective wildtype backgrounds on trays containing soil medium with different levels of dissolved MgSO 4?7H2O. To control for environmental variation, each tray was divided in 8 sections, with a mutant line and its associated wildtype background line planted in alternating fashion.

The plants shown here are 3 weeks old and were harvested and analyzed after completing 4 weeks of growth. The experiment was repeated threetimes.doi:10.1371journal.pone.0012348.g004Arabidopsis in Mars-Like MgSO4 PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 6 August 2010  Volume 5  Issue 8  e12348Arabidopsis in Mars-Like MgSO4 PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 7 August 2010  Volume 5  Issue 8  e12348Root Transcriptome Root transcriptome remodeling was analyzed in Arabidopsis after hydroponic exposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO 4?7H2O (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Table S2). The number of genes with statistically significant differences in expression between Col-0 exposed to MgSO 4?7H2O and Col-0 exposed to control conditions increased from 325 (Time 45) to 1516 (Time 90) and 3265 (Time 180) (Fig. 6). The number of genes with a significant difference in expression of over 2-fold increased accordingly, from 100 to 248and 445. Between cax1-1 and Col-0 exposed to MgSO 4?7H2O for 180 min., only 4 unique transcripts showed a significant difference in expression, and all were over a 2-fold change in abundance (Fig. 6). Primary MgSO 4?7H2O stress response The primary root transcriptome responses to MgSO 4?7H2O stress were analyzed in Col-0 treated for 45 min. versus Col-0 treated with a control solution for 45 min. (Time 45) to reveal genes involved in the metabolic response to this environment as candidate genes that could play a role in high magnesium sulfate tolerance. The resulting set of 325 genes with significantdifferences in expression was analyzed for over- and under- represented GO molecular function categories. Significantly over- represented categories were polygalacturonase activity, calcium ion binding, and transcription factor activity (Table 2). Many of the transcripts represented at Time 45 encode phytohormone associated proteins, transcription factors, Ca 2-binding proteins, kinases, phosphatases, disease resistance proteins, cell wall related proteins, membrane-based transporters, as well as proteins of unknown functional category. The better characterized of thesegenes are listed by category in Table 3. For example, phytohormone associated genes encoding enzymes involved in ABA (9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase), ethylene (1-aminocy- clopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) and jasmonic acid (lipoxygen- ase ) biosynthesis pathways show up-regulated expression. The gene encoding C2H2 type zinc finger family transcription factor ZAT7 is up-regulated, while the gene encoding transcription factor WRKY70 is down-regulated at Time 45. The expression of the gene encoding CBL-interacting protein kinase CIPK9 is up-regulated. Genes encoding cell-wall and disease-resistance associ- ated proteins are also well represented; fasciclin-like arabinoga- lactan proteins, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (RHD1), xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH9) and beta-expansin (EXPB1) show down-regulated expression, while the expression of several genes encoding alpha-expansin proteins is up-regulated at Time 45. Well-characterized genes encoding membrane based transporters that are differentially expressed include those encoding calcium exchanger CAX1, calcium-transporting ATPase ACA2, cyclicnucleotide-gated channels CNGC19 and CNGC1, potassium transporter HAK5 and inorganic phosphate transporter PHT1. The 500 bp upstream regions of the down-regulated and up- regulated genes at Time 45 were statistically analyzed for over- represented six-mer sequences (motifs), which may correspond to cis-regulatory elements. Table 4 lists the ten motifs with the highest significance (lowest p-values) for both the up-regulated and down- regulated subsets of genes. The motif with the highest significancein the subset of up-regulated genes is an ABRE coupling element (ABRE-CE). The 325 differentially expressed genes at Time 45were furthermore compared with a cluster of 197 genes that are known to be differentially expressed in response to a broad range of stress conditions, including cold, osmotic stress, salinity,wounding, and biotic stresses 28. The comparison showed that at least 18 of the 325 genes differentially expressed at Time 45 appear to be universally responsive to stress conditions (Table 5).These include for example genes encoding Ca 2-binding, kinase, zinc finger, and disease resistance proteins. Membrane transporters Col-0 time series Of special interest is the differential expression of transporter genes as they may represent a metabolic strategy for tolerance to an elevated magnesium sulfate environment. Over 200 differentgenes encoding membrane-based transporters were differentiallyexpressed across the Col-0 time series (Table S2). Since the Time 90 and 180 comparisons are not fully controlled for diurnal effects, gene expression differences for several transporter genes of interestto this study were analyzed by Q-PCR using diurnally controlled samples. The number of differentially expressed transporter genes increased from 13 at Time 45, to 74 at Time 90 and 189 at Time180 (Table 2). The expression of the 217 unique genes encodingtransporters across the Col-0 time series was analyzed by cluster algorithms to reveal subsets of genes with corresponding patterns of expression (Fig. 7 and Fig. S1). The differential expression of genes encoding known magne- sium, sulfate and calciumproton transporters is summarized in Table 6. The summary shows that the expression of the genesencoding magnesium transporters MRS2-10 and MRS2-7 isslightly up-regulated. Genes encoding sulfate transporters SULTR3;4, SULTR3;1 and SULTR4;1 (a vacuolar H SO 422 cotransporter) show down-regulated expression. The down- regulated expression of the gene encoding SULTR3;4 was confirmed by Q-PCR at 180 min., although its down-regulated expression was less pronounced when controlled for diurnal effects(Table 7, Fig. 8). The gene encoding the vacuolar Mg 2H antiporter (MHX) shows up-regulated expression, while the vacuolar Ca2Hantiporters CAX1, CAX2 and CAX3 show down-regulated expression. The down-regulated expression ofCAX1 was confirmed by Q-PCR after 180 min. of exposure whencontrolled for diurnal effects (Table 7, Fig. 8). Besides the genes described above, there were many examples of differentially expressed genes encoding transporters of unknown functionbelonging to several large transporter gene families. Represented families include the MATE efflux family, the ABC transporter family, the integral membrane family, the major intrinsic proteinfamily, the cation efflux family, the cation-chloride cotransporterfamily, the anion exchange family, and the ATPase E1E2 type family. In addition, several genes encoding transporter-related proteins and putative transporters were differentially expressed. Differentially regulated genes cax1-1 Col-0 comparison Only 4 unique transcripts showed a significant difference in expression between the cax1-1 and Col-0 sample sets treated for 180 minutes (Table 8).

Because sel1-10 mutants are known to take up 80 less sulfate than their wildtype background Ws, these results mean that phytotoxic effectsof magnesium sulfate on overall plant growth are dominated by the Mg 2cation. Overexpression of AtMRS2-10 (AtMGT1 )i n Nicotiana benthamiana led to increased accumulation of magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) per unit dry weight and per plant compared to wildtype plants 29. However, the potentialrole of AtMRS2-10 as a major uptake transporter of Mg 2in Arabidopsis remains uncertain based on the observation that mrs2- 10plants did not show a significant difference in leaf Mg levels compared to Col-0 under standard nutrient conditions. This could explain why, despite the indication that Mg dominantly affects overall plant growth, the mrs2-10 mutant did not show a significant improvement in growth performance compared to Col-0. Interestingly, the dominant role of Mg is also supported by theTable 2.

The soil data shown in Figures 5 and 6 are in line with the relative tolerance of cax1-1 on agar to high concentrations of dissolved MgCl 2,a mineral in which the Mg2cation is the dominant phytotoxic factor 16. In addition, Bradshaw et al (2005) observed that cax1 mutants are better able to tolerate the low Ca:Mg ratios characteristic of terrestrial serpentine soils. The CAX1 knockout mutation does not fully eliminate the effects of high magnesium sulfate on plant growth performance; the absolute FW shootbiomass of cax1-1 grown on soil for four weeks was still low (20) compared to untreated Col-0. The primary Arabidopsis Col-0 root transcriptome responses to elevated levels of magnesium sulfate suggest a number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing the growth performance of plants exposed to this nutrient stress. Transcrip- tome responses of Arabidopsis Col-0 roots exposed to MgSO 4?7H2O versus a control solution for 45 min. revealed over 300 differentially expressed genes. Genes of known functional category include those encoding enzymes involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinas- es, disease resistance proteins, cell wall related proteins, and membrane-based transporters. The biological significance of thisseemingly diverse set of gene classes illustrates the comprehensive nature of a primary abiotic stress response. The differentiallyexpressed genes at Time 45 encoding enzymes in the ABA,ethylene and jasmonate biosynthesis pathways point to possible changes in the synthesis of these phytohormones. ABA, ethylene, and jasmonic acid have all been implicated in adaptivemechanisms of osmotic stress, ion-mediated signal transductionand the regulation of transporters 30,31,32. The exact role of many of the differentially expressed genes at Time 45 encoding transcription factors is currently unknown, although some areassociated with tolerance to other abiotic stresses. The up-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding ZAT7 is for example in line with the finding that ZAT7 renders plants more tolerant to salinity stress when constitutively expressed 33. The down-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding WRKY70 correlateswith the observation that WRKY70 functions as a negative regulator of developmental senescence and is involved in plant defense signaling pathways 34. The majority of transcriptsencoding kinases that are differentially expressed at Time 45encode uncharacterized protein kinases as well as receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) with extracytoplasmic leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) or with an extracellular lectin-like domain. RLKs aremembrane-spanning proteins with a predicted signal sequence anda cytoplasmic kinase domain that have been implicated in a wide range of signal transduction pathways 35. The up-regulated expression of the gene encoding CBL-interacting protein kinaseCIPK9 at Time 45 is consonant with the fact that CIPK9 isrequired for low-potassium tolerance in Arabidopsis 36. Genesencoding proteins that belong to the transcription factor or kinase categories might be transcriptional or post-translational regulators of transporters 37. Within the group of genes encoding membrane based transporters, the Ca 2Hantiporter CAX1 is one of the fewTable 4.

The slightly up-regulated expression of the geneencoding magnesium transpo rter MRS2-10 at Time 90 and 180 agrees with the observation that a knockout mutant ofAtMRS2-10 (mrs2-10 ) does not show improved growth in the form of higher FW shoot biomass compared to Col-0 at elevatedlevels of magnesium sulfate. MRS2 transporters have beenshown to transport other ions in addition to Mg 229,38. Schock et al. (2002) speculate that, in line with the large numberofAtMRS2 family members, the function of the AtMRS2 gene family may be the maintenance of metal ion homeostasis indifferent cellular compartment s (i.e. over different cellular membrane systems). The expression of the gene encodingSULTR1;2, a high-affinity sulf ate transporter, showed no significant differences at the three time points. The fact thatexpression of the gene is not down-regulated in the earlyadaptation response of Arabid opsis roots to high levels of magnesium sulfate supports the outcome of the FW shoot biomass comparison between the AtSULTR1;2 knockout mutant sel1-10 and Col-0, which showed no advantage for sel1-10 .T h e gene encoding EIL3, one of the known transcriptionalregulators of SULTR1;2 39, did not show a significant difference in expression at any of the time points either. Interestingly, two sulfate transporter genes of the same family as SULTR1;2 show down-regulated expression; the gene encoding SULTR3;4 at Time 90 and 180, and the gene encodingSULTR3;1 at Time 180. The spatial and subcellular localizationof these transporters is not known, and so far no influence on the expression of Group 3 sulfate transporters by the sulfur status ofplants has been reported 40. This study shows for the first timethat genes encoding Group 3 sulfate transporters SULTR3;1 andSULTR3;4 are differentially expressed in roots upon exposure tohigh levels of sulfate. The expression of the gene encoding anothersulfate transporter - the tonoplast-localized H SO 422cotran- sporter SULTR4;1 - is also down-regulated at Time 180, pointingat the possible retention of excess SO 422in the vacuole. Similarly, the up-regulated expression of the gene encoding the vacuolarMHX transporter indicates the possible storage of excess Mg 2in the vacuole. Both MHX and SULTR1;4 could be seen as marker genes for excess magnesium sulfate recognition by the plant, sincevacuolar storage of excess ions is a well-known defense mechanismagainst ion stress. Several members of the CAX (cation exchanger) family show down-regulated expression in response to elevated magnesiumsulfate. The Ca 2Hantiporter CAX1, which shows down- regulated expression across the time points, is localized to thetonoplast and responsible for 50 of the Ca 2Hantiport activity there 16. CAX2 has been shown to transport Ca2and Mn2 into the vacuole in Arabidopsis and other plant species 41, and CAX3 is known as a weak Ca2vacuolar transporter. CAX1 and CAX3 can be combined as hetero-CAX complexes to formfunctional transporters with distinct transport properties 42. Thedown-regulated expression of the genes encoding these threevacuolar Ca 2Hantiporters indicates a possible shortage of calcium in the cytosol upon high magnesium sulfate exposure. In total, over 200 differentially expressed genes encoding membrane-based transporters were identified across the Col-0Figure 7.

Among the genes encoding transporters of known and unknown function, candidates for improving plant tolerance tohigh magnesium sulfate may be found. Transporters of unknown function include for example major intrinsic proteins, cyclic nucleotide gated channels, integral membrane proteins, cationefflux family proteins, ATPase E1E2 type family proteins, MATE efflux family proteins, transporter-related proteins and putative transporters. The differential expression of only four unique transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0 plants after 180 min. of MgSO 4?7H2O treatment indicates that the root transcriptome responses are virtually identica l for the two genotypes at this time after initiation of treatment. In our transcriptome study wesee down-regulation of the gene e ncoding vacuolar sulfate efflux transporter SULTR4;1 at Time 180, and up-regulation of the gene encoding vacuolar magnes ium influx transporter MHX at Time 90 and Time 180 in Col-0 exposed to elevated magnesium sulfate. Both of these responses point to storage of excessmagnesium and sulfate ions in the vacuole. This means that the profile is most probably not performed at a time point before plants recognize excess magnesium sulfate, especially since over 3000 differentially expressed genes were detected in Col-0 at Time 180, in addition to the vacuolar marker genes. We could therefore not foresee that after 180 minutes of exposure there were no more than four different ially expressed transcripts between the cax1-1 mutant and Col-0. One of the main reasons for the limited number of differentially regulated transcripts between the genotypes at this tim e after initiation of treatment may be that CAX1 is one of the few transporter genes that are already differentially expresse da f t e r4 5m i n .o fe x p o s u r ei nC o l - 0, which means that down-regulated expression of CAX1 is an important natural response of Ar a b i d o p s i st oe l e v a t e dl e v e l so f magnesium sulfate. The response of CAX1 and other CAX family members in the Col-0 time series suggests that a deficiency ofcalcium caused by high levels o f magnesium and possibly by calcium sulfate precipitatio n could play a major part in the reduction of plant growth perfo rmance in the presence of high magnesium sulfate concentrations. The difference between the immediately down-regulated level of CAX1 in Col-0 and the absence of CAX1 in the cax1-1 knockout mutant is apparently not sufficiently large at 180 min. a fter initiation of treatment toreveal many of the downstream molecular processes eventually leading to enhanced growth performance and reduced leaf Mg content of cax1-1 compared to Col-0 after several weeks of g r o w t h .T h i sr e s u l ti ss i g n i f icant in that follow-up studies contrasting cax1-1 with Col-0 can look at profiles after possibly even days of exposure. Conclusions and perspectives It was initially thought that the mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants would have an advantage over wildtype in elevated magnesium sulfate soils, but this was not the case. However, fresh weight shoot biomass analyses showed that although mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants were not more successful than wildtype in this soil environment, the cax1 mutants were. Thus, cax1 mutants are currently the only confirmed genotype with partial tolerance to the phytotoxic levels of magnesium sulfate expected for the regolith on Mars. To further characterize the response of Arabidopsis to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate a set of experiments was conducted to evaluate patterns of gene expression in wildtype (Col-0) and cax1 mutants. The 325 genes differentially expressed in Col-0 roots after 45 min. of exposure to high magnesium sulfate can be seen as candidate genes for enhanced tolerance. This set of genes included CAX1 , 18 genes previously associated with enhanced tolerance to broad ranges of abiotic stresses, and several well-characterized genes known to enhance tolerance to other salts like NaCl. Many of the differentially regulated genes contain promoter sequence motifs that are known to play a role in ABA-mediated regulation, such as ABRE-CE. This abundance suggests that ABA plays a role in regulating the stress response to elevated magnesium sulfate. In addition, a rich pool of candidates is found in the 200 transporter genes that are differentially expressed in Col-0 across the timepoints. Many genes in this set encode transporters of unknown function. These unknown transporter genes, along with the four differentially regulated transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0, are of particular interest as they encode proteins of unknown function whose roles are now at least implicated. This study functions as a solid basis for the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by reducing the number of potential candidate genes from tens of thousands to several hundred. Future research efforts could determine whether any of theseTable 7. Q-PCR analysis results. Gene TypeRelative Expression (Array results) Std.

        "introduction": "Long duration human missions to Mars must rely on more than just stored supplies and physico-chemical means to regenerate airand clean water. The Advanced Life Support (ALS) scenarios envisioned for extended manned missions will depend upon the efficient use of local planetary resources and the recycling of limitedmaterials such as water, pressurized atmosphere, and organic matter, while producing food to augment supplies 1. The use of in situ regolith for plant growth in a future bioregenerative life support system on Mars may have several advantages over hydroponicsystems 2,3. These include the immediate bioavailability of plant essential ions, low-tech mechanical support for plants, and easy access to in situ materials once on the surface. However, plant growth may be reduced or inhibited by phytotoxic substances in the regolith, such as high levels of soluble magnesium sulfate minerals. Hydrated forms of magnesium sulfate such as MgSO 4?7H2O (epsomite) and MgSO 4?H2O (kieserite) have been detected in several regions by the Mars Express Satellite 4,5,6. Analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover landers at Meridiani Planum and Gusev crater have also indicated the presence of high levels of magnesium sulfate minerals (up to 10 wt) in outcrops and soils 7,8,9. PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 August 2010  Volume 5  Issue 8  e12348High levels of hydrated sulfate minerals in regolith on Mars used in bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg2and SO422ions in the soil solution. Plants may have evolved to cope with relatively high levels of elements in the soil environment by limiting internal accumulation or tolerating high internal concen-trations 10. In a potential bioregenerative life support system on Mars, an excess of a particular element in the crews diet could affect the availability of other required elements. This study therefore first determined whether knockout mutant lines for genes encoding certain transporters responsible for uptake of Mg 2and SO422ions in roots could enhance plant tolerance to high levels of magnesium sulfate in the growth medium and then moved to a molecular analysis of the responses to Mg2and SO 422in order to increase the potential pool of candidate genes. Various efforts have previously illustrated that the disabling of transporter genes can indeed improve tolerance to certain elements. For example, a line of transgenic wheat plants expressing an antisense construct of the high affinity Ktransporter TaHKT2;1 showed reduced sodium uptake by roots and enhanced growth relative to unstressed plants compared to a control line at high levels of NaCl in the growth medium 11. Several plasma membrane localized proteins in the outer cell layers of Arabidopsis roots are known to be responsible for magnesium or sulfate ion uptake. Two specific genes, AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2 , were chosen for this study, in part because of their localization and because of availability of knockout lines. AtMRS2-10 (AtMGT1 ) functionally complemented a bacterial mutant lacking Mg2transport capability and AtMRS2-10-GFP expressing plants showed fluorescence in the periphery of root cells, suggesting a plasma membrane association 12. AtMRS2-10 is, to date, the only member of the AtMRS2 family that is known to be associated to the plasma membrane of root cells in addition to having Mg2ion transport capability. Therefore, a knockout mutant line of the AtMRS2-10 gene ( mrs 2-10 ) was characterized for this study based on the SALK_100361.41.30.x T-DNA insertion line 13. AtSULTR1;2 is a constitutively expressed sulfate transporter gene whose product AtSULTR1;2 is localized in root hair, epidermal and cortical cells where it ensures sulfate uptake into plants under sulfur-replete conditions 14. A knockoutmutant line of the AtSULTR1;2 gene ( sel1-10 ) was shown to take up 80 less sulfate than wildtype when grown for 12 days on agar with optimal levels (1.7 mM MgSO 4?7H2O) of sulfate 15. Knockout lines of genes encoding vacuolar HCa2transport- ers CAX1 and CAX3 were also analyzed to present perspective of other, non-plasma membrane, cellular transporter locations. The cax1-1 and cax1cax3 lines were previously shown to be more tolerant of high Mg2levels in the form of MgCl 2when grown on agar 16,17. In a separate study, a CAX1 knockout mutant was identified through a mutant screen on nutrient solutions reflecting low Ca:Mg ratios characteristic of serpentine soils 18. When high MgSO 4?7H2O concentrations are applied, the Ca:Mg ratio of the nutrient solution decreases, which therefore makes the cax1-1 and cax1cax3 mutants candidates for high magnesium sulfate tolerance. This study determined whether enhanced tolerance to low Ca:Mg ratios is maintained when cax1-1 and cax1cax3 mutants are exposed to elevated SO 422in addition to elevated Mg2in soil medium. These candidate genes for enhanced magnesium sulfate tolerance that are presented above were selected based on previous literature describing the results of individual gene or gene family analyses. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of plants exposed to elevated concentrations of magnesium, sulfate, or magnesium sulfate in the growth medium have not beenreported to date. In order to increase the number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing growth performance ofplants exposed to this abiotic stress, root transcriptome remodelingin Col-0 was analyzed after short-term (45 min.) hydroponicexposure to a non-lethal, high concentration of MgSO 4?7H2O. This early time point was chosen to capture part of the primarystress responses. The differential expression of transporter geneswas analyzed after 90 min. and 180 min. in addition to 45 min.,as this group in particular may represent a metabolic strategy fortolerance to an elevated magnesium sulfate environment. The roottranscriptome of the transporter gene knockout mutant cax1-1 was furthermore contrasted with that of Col-0 after both genotypeswere exposed to MgSO 4?7H2O treatment for 180 min. Based on their previously identified tolerance to high MgCl 2and low Ca:Mg ratios, cax1mutants are likely to show enhanced growth compared to wildtype when exposed to high magnesium sulfate levels.Furthermore, ionome analyses of cax1 mutants showed that they have significantly reduced levels of Mg 2in their leaves compared to wildtype 18.The cax1cax3 double knockout mutant, while having the potential to show tolerance to elevated MgSO 4?7H2O based on its tolerance to MgCl 2and its reduced shoot levels of Mg2, showed significant differences in concentration of multiple elements, and grew more slowly than wildtype under regularnutrient conditions 17. Since cax1-1 mutants did not display negative effects on growth under regular nutrient conditions, cax1- 1rather than cax1cax3 was included in the root transcriptome analysis. Genes differentially regulated between cax1-1 and Col-0 grown under stress conditions could reveal those molecularprocesses possibly leading to significant differences in growthperformance at the whole plant level. A hydroponic medium waschosen to mimic root exposure to a specific soil solution in order to directly link transcriptome responses to the level of bioavailable ions that roots may experience in a hypothetical root zone of aregolith profile on Mars 19. The treatment concentration ofMgSO 4?7H2O was based on the low Ca:Mg ratio that can occur in serpentine soils on Earth. Because of their high amount ofbioavailable magnesium, Serpentine soils can be seen as a partialanalogue for regolith high in magnesium sulfate on Mars 20. Materials and",
