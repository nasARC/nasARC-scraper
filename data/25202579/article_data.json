ApApplicatitionsons inin Pl Plant t ScienSciencesces Experimental  exibility is a luxury often taken for granted in typical laboratory science. Adapting a protocol in response to unfolding information as the experiment proceeds is a key element in discovery and is standard practice. In space ight, this luxury is not as accessible; crew time is highly regulated, orbital resources are limited, and protocols are tightly controlled once in place. In addition, the up-mass available to each re-searcher is limited, which restricts the choices of experimental treatments and orbital  xation options. These constraints often translate into hard choices that limit the scienti c return on investment, including sacri cing the number of replicates to enable additional treatment and  xation scenarios. As a conse- quence, options that allow maximization of the data obtained from a single sample are highly valued. Biological experiments are typically required to be segre- gated based on the analyses to be performed upon return from space ight. These segregated conditions are usually either mo- lecular or morphological, due to the separate  xatives required for each application (e.g., Stutte et al., 2006 ). Investigations focused on transcriptome analyses, for instance, would not be likely to commit a portion of their limited up-mass on samples and associated  xation hardware for morphological applica tions, and would miss the opportunity to use both morphological and molecular perspectives. These limitations are keenly felt in scenarios where the transcriptome analyses reveal space ight- speci c patterns of gene expression central to morphological patterns of cell growth and development. This scenario was en-countered in a recent space ight experiment, in which telemet- ric imaging revealed interesting space ight-associated root morphologies ( Paul et al., 2012 ). All material was  xed on orbit in RNA later (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA) to facili- tate transcriptome analyses on returned samples. Although it is possible to partition an experiment into mo- lecular and morphological components, using samples that cor-respond directly to those used in molecular applications would be of extreme value. A single  xation protocol better enables the full use of replicates to support a robust power analysis; all plant material allowed by the up-mass constraints can be dedicated to a single application per orbital treatment. Addi-tionally, the plant material apportioned for microscopy can be taken directly from the pool of material whose balance repre-sents a molecular replicate; thus, any morphologic change seen in these plants would directly re ect the effects of the altered gene expressions from those same plants. Terrestrial  eld stud- ies could also bene t from this single  xative approach for similar reasons. Despite its use as a molecular  xative, RNA later is not com- monly used as a morphologic  xative. RNA later  xation pro- duces unclear images with high background staining ( Cadoret et al., 2013 ) and reduces immuno uorescent signals ( Zaitoun et al., 2010 ; Paul and Ferl, 2011 ). This intracellular occlusion eliminates the possibility of clear subcellular localizations. 1 Manuscript received 30 April 2013; revision accepted 9 July 2013.

One  nal exchange was per- formed and left overnight. Two additional 10-min in ltrations were performed, followed by CPD with controlled venting. Samples were in solution until the end of CPD. Dry samples in baskets were transferred to a desiccant- lled (Drierite; W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Xenia, Ohio, USA) sealable con-tainer until being mounted on stubs using carbon adhesive and returned to a stub rack within a different desiccant- lled sealable container. Mounted sam- ples were sputter-coated for 90 s with a gold-palladium alloy (Desk V HP; Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, New Jersey, USA) and imaged on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Initial observations were focused on roots, resolution of cell  les, and reten- tion of root hairs throughout the processing of the tissue ( Fig. 2 ) . Later tests observed trichomes and more durable tissues, such as adaxial leaf surfaces and seed coats ( Fig. 2AC ). The fresh-frozen tissues, used as protocol development control material, retained  ner details, including closed stomata and normal trichome morphology ( Fig. 2D, E ). RNA later - xed test materials yielded simi- lar images as the fresh-frozen plants, with minimal additional tissue damage ( Fig. 2FK ). Space ight materials and the corresponding ground controls, both  xed in RNA later , were processed using the protocol discussed above and detailed in Appendix 1. Tissues yielded images of acceptable quality, with minimal cell wrinkling and high retention of  ne details ( Fig. 2J, K ). The focus of these samples was root structure, morphology, and root hair retention because of in-teresting molecular and genetic observations from a recent space ight experi- ment ( Paul et al., 2012 ; Paul et al., unpublished ). Cost of the developed protocol is minimal, while the accessibility is high. Assuming the microscopy core to be used has standard SEM capability, the ad-ditional cost of this protocol is merely the cost of consumables. These compo-nents are readily available and likely already obtained by the laboratory interested in using this protocol. Another advantage of this protocol is a near retention of tissue morphology at a fresh harvest state. Not only are  ner elements of tissues retained ( Fig. 2DI ), but other tissues, such as the adaxial leaf epider-mis, seed coat, and  oral stalk ( Fig. 2AC ), produce results comparable to those processed through dedicated morphologic means (e.g., Bhargava et al., 2013 ). The amount of time needed for this process is slightly longer than other stan-dard SEM processing times, with an additional 4 h for the desalination washes and several days required for freeze substitution. Hand-plunged samples may be processed in batches to increase throughput, being limited to the number of samples able to be held with a pair of forceps without compromising structural integrity. Examples of other SEM protocols may be seen in Liu et al. (2008) , Koizumi et al. (2010) , Springer et al. (2010) , and Yi et al. (2010) . As a result of this protocol, samples  xed with RNA later retained many  ne features includ- ing root hairs and trichomes, with a majority of cells in ated and displaying fresh-frozenlike morphology, regardless of whether they were harvested dur-ing space ight or on the ground. CONCLUSIONS The protocol presented here provides distinct advantages for both space ight and ground-based experimental applications. Arabidopsis plants harvested on the International Space Station by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNA later and processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use of a dedicated morphologic  xative ( Fig. 2J, K ). Field studies may also bene t from the use of this protocol. As in space ight, the amount of materials able to be carried and used during an expedition is limited. With the option of using one stable, safe chemical  xative for all desired studies to be conducted upon return, scientists in the  eld may be able to collect more data with fewer trips. This protocol may also assist laboratories with libraries of samples in RNA later by expanding the available techniques for study. Alternative imaging techniques outside the scope of this investigation provide alternatives to this protocol. True cryo-SEM would likely be an acceptable alternative (examples may be seen in Koroleva et al., 2010 ; Sarsby et al., 2012 ; and Yu et al., 2013 ), though desalination of specimens prior to tis-sue processing would still be bene cial. A second option is However, the external morphology appears to be preserved in a fresh-like state, which suggests that RNA later may be accept- able for use in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two cases in the literature report the use of RNA later in a morphological investigation. Behrendt et al. (2011) reported that coral covered in crustose coralline algae was  xed in RNA later , post xed in 2 glutaraldehyde, rinsed in sodium cacodylate, and post xed again in OsO 4 prior to SEM investigations. Hofer et al. (2012) used SEM in their study on  oral organs of Clermontia species using RNA later as their main  xative with a hexamethyldisila- zane drying step. In the current study, both of the above tech-niques resulted in signi cant tissue damage in Arabidopsis . An alternative to  xation in SEM sample preparation is freez- ing. Cryo-SEM does not require prior  xation, but instead pre- serves tissues in a fresh-like state for imaging ( Koroleva et al., 2010 ; Sarsby et al., 2012 ; Yu et al., 2013 ). However, few labo-ratories have access to such equipment, and the equipment and operation can often be expensive. Therefore, this study inves-tigated the possibility of emulating cryo-SEM on a standard SEM, a cryo-analog, where tissue would  rst be returned to a fresh-like state for freezing prior to imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS For process development, test samples of 912-d-old A. thaliana var. colum- bia (Col-0) or Wassilewskija (WS) (The Arabidopsis Information Resource TAIR, Columbus, Ohio, USA) were harvested into RNA later and  xed over- night at ambient room temperature. Fixed plants, along with freshly harvested individuals of the same age, were washed in distilled water with gentle rocking for four 1-h increments. This washing step was designed to desalinate RNA lat- er - xed samples, as the salt crystals were found to damage tissue during subse- quent steps ( Fig. 1A, B ) . Desalination also returned the plants to a fresh-like state ( Fig. 1C, D ) suitable for  ash-freezing. Tissues were dissected immedi- ately following the  nal wash into 510-mm lengths to  t on the SEM sample stage (stub). The  rst two protocols tested provided valuable lessons. The  rst cryo- analog protocol was  ash freezing in liquid nitrogen (LN 2 ). Tissues were severely damaged, primarily due to rapid crystallization of water into ice, physically compromising cellular integrity. The second protocol tested was high-pressure freezing (HPF; Bal-Tec HPM100; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), which resulted in vitri ed ice and a greater freezing depth. The noncrystalline structure prevented physical damage, but the roots had a tendency to stick to the planchettes and break ( Fig. 1E, F ). The third protocol tested was based on the lessons learned and resulted in minimal tissue damage. The risk of waterice crystal formation and planchette adhesion was minimized using a variety of methods. Samples were run through a methanol dehydration gradient, starting at 10 and increasing at 10 inter-vals, for 10 min at each step. An optional wash of 0.1 tannic acid in methanol was used to enhance electron density ( Mizuhira et al., 1972 ; Roholl et al., 1981 ). Arabidopsis tissues were hand-plunged using forceps into LN 2 -cooled liquid ethane, which vitri ed any remaining water in each sample. These rapid hand-performed plunges provided more control and less damage than auto-mated plunge devices. Samples were immediately transferred to LN 2 -cooled individual cryovials, containing either 2 OsO 4 in MeOH or 0.5 glutaralde- hyde in 0.1 tannic acid. The headspace in each vial was  lled with LN 2 to prevent samples being lost or damaged due to static electric effects. Cryovials were placed into freeze substitution (Leica EM AFS2; Leica Microsystems) to increase the temperature to 10  C over the course of 410 d. Cryovial caps were left slightly loose to vent nitrogen gas. Once the temperature reached 10  C, cryovials were removed, opened, and tissues were transferred to tissue baskets (SPI microporous specimen capsules, 120200  m pore size; Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) while submerged in chilled (4  C) methanol. This transfer took place at ambient room temperature; the chilled methanol submersion is enough to maintain the integrity of the tissues. Indi vidual baskets were labeled using pencil on a small piece of paper approximately 2 mm 2 , as external labels were removed during the drying phase. Drying oc- curred via liquid CO 2 critical point drying (CPD; Bal-Tec CPD 030; Leica Micro- systems). Eleven quick-cycled washes replaced most of the loading methanol Applications in Plant Sciences 2013 1 ( 8 ): 1300034 Schultz et al.Space ight RNA later Arabidopsis SEM doi:10.3732apps.1300034 3 of 5 http:www.bioone.orgloiapps Hansma et al., 1989 ; Ushiki et al., 2012 ). Due to the high ionic content of RNA later and the necessity for an ionic submersion liquid for SICM, it is possible that this instrument could gen-erate comparable images without any tissue processing. This a cryo- holder, seen in Tang et al. (2012) , which may prove to be an acceptable alternative step in this protocol if the SEM being used can handle the LN 2 vapors. A third alternative is scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM; Marti et al., 1988 ; Fig. 1. Preliminary RNA later - xation investigations.

The double-corolla phenotype in the Hawaiian lobelioid genus Clermontia involves possibility was not tested due to lack of access to the necessary equipment. The protocol reported here will likely require optimization for each desired tissue to be tested. Arabidopsis is a very fragile tissue, with limited  at surfaces and small organ sizes. Other plants that may be more robust may tolerate a rougher tech-nique, while more fragile tissues (i.e.,  oral tissues) may need a more gentle approach. Some potential additional steps to enhance tissue integrity include a post xation step or revers- ing CPD and sputter-coating. A post xation step (as seen in Behrendt et al., 2011 ), which would take place after the desali-nation, could improve tissue integrity during the cryo-analog plunge, especially if  xatives for electron microscopy, such as Karnovskys or OsO 4 , are used. Sputter-coating prior to CPD (as seen in Yi et al., 2010 ) may also improve the physical tissue integrity, though both mounting prior to CPD and pulling a vacuum during the coating process may prove dif cult. The use of this protocol provides more morphological op- portunities for samples that would have previously been wasted due to improper  xation. It is designed to be a supplement to rather than a replacement of SEM standard practices. Although Fig. 2.

The amount of time needed for this process is slightly longer than other stan-dard SEM processing times, with an additional 4 h for the desalination washes and several days required for freeze substitution. Hand-plunged samples may be processed in batches to increase throughput, being limited to the number of samples able to be held with a pair of forceps without compromising structural integrity. Examples of other SEM protocols may be seen in Liu et al. (2008) , Koizumi et al. (2010) , Springer et al. (2010) , and Yi et al. (2010) . As a result of this protocol, samples  xed with RNA later retained many  ne features includ- ing root hairs and trichomes, with a majority of cells in ated and displaying fresh-frozenlike morphology, regardless of whether they were harvested dur-ing space ight or on the ground. CONCLUSIONS The protocol presented here provides distinct advantages for both space ight and ground-based experimental applications. Arabidopsis plants harvested on the International Space Station by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNA later and processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use of a dedicated morphologic  xative ( Fig. 2J, K ). Field studies may also bene t from the use of this protocol. As in space ight, the amount of materials able to be carried and used during an expedition is limited. With the option of using one stable, safe chemical  xative for all desired studies to be conducted upon return, scientists in the  eld may be able to collect more data with fewer trips. This protocol may also assist laboratories with libraries of samples in RNA later by expanding the available techniques for study. Alternative imaging techniques outside the scope of this investigation provide alternatives to this protocol. True cryo-SEM would likely be an acceptable alternative (examples may be seen in Koroleva et al., 2010 ; Sarsby et al., 2012 ; and Yu et al., 2013 ), though desalination of specimens prior to tis-sue processing would still be bene cial. A second option is However, the external morphology appears to be preserved in a fresh-like state, which suggests that RNA later may be accept- able for use in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two cases in the literature report the use of RNA later in a morphological investigation. Behrendt et al. (2011) reported that coral covered in crustose coralline algae was  xed in RNA later , post xed in 2 glutaraldehyde, rinsed in sodium cacodylate, and post xed again in OsO 4 prior to SEM investigations. Hofer et al. (2012) used SEM in their study on  oral organs of Clermontia species using RNA later as their main  xative with a hexamethyldisila- zane drying step. In the current study, both of the above tech-niques resulted in signi cant tissue damage in Arabidopsis . An alternative to  xation in SEM sample preparation is freez- ing. Cryo-SEM does not require prior  xation, but instead pre- serves tissues in a fresh-like state for imaging ( Koroleva et al., 2010 ; Sarsby et al., 2012 ; Yu et al., 2013 ). However, few labo-ratories have access to such equipment, and the equipment and operation can often be expensive. Therefore, this study inves-tigated the possibility of emulating cryo-SEM on a standard SEM, a cryo-analog, where tissue would  rst be returned to a fresh-like state for freezing prior to imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS For process development, test samples of 912-d-old A. thaliana var. colum- bia (Col-0) or Wassilewskija (WS) (The Arabidopsis Information Resource TAIR, Columbus, Ohio, USA) were harvested into RNA later and  xed over- night at ambient room temperature. Fixed plants, along with freshly harvested individuals of the same age, were washed in distilled water with gentle rocking for four 1-h increments. This washing step was designed to desalinate RNA lat- er - xed samples, as the salt crystals were found to damage tissue during subse- quent steps ( Fig. 1A, B ) . Desalination also returned the plants to a fresh-like state ( Fig. 1C, D ) suitable for  ash-freezing. Tissues were dissected immedi- ately following the  nal wash into 510-mm lengths to  t on the SEM sample stage (stub). The  rst two protocols tested provided valuable lessons. The  rst cryo- analog protocol was  ash freezing in liquid nitrogen (LN 2 ). Tissues were severely damaged, primarily due to rapid crystallization of water into ice, physically compromising cellular integrity. The second protocol tested was high-pressure freezing (HPF; Bal-Tec HPM100; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), which resulted in vitri ed ice and a greater freezing depth. The noncrystalline structure prevented physical damage, but the roots had a tendency to stick to the planchettes and break ( Fig. 1E, F ). The third protocol tested was based on the lessons learned and resulted in minimal tissue damage. The risk of waterice crystal formation and planchette adhesion was minimized using a variety of methods. Samples were run through a methanol dehydration gradient, starting at 10 and increasing at 10 inter-vals, for 10 min at each step. An optional wash of 0.1 tannic acid in methanol was used to enhance electron density ( Mizuhira et al., 1972 ; Roholl et al., 1981 ). Arabidopsis tissues were hand-plunged using forceps into LN 2 -cooled liquid ethane, which vitri ed any remaining water in each sample. These rapid hand-performed plunges provided more control and less damage than auto-mated plunge devices. Samples were immediately transferred to LN 2 -cooled individual cryovials, containing either 2 OsO 4 in MeOH or 0.5 glutaralde- hyde in 0.1 tannic acid. The headspace in each vial was  lled with LN 2 to prevent samples being lost or damaged due to static electric effects. Cryovials were placed into freeze substitution (Leica EM AFS2; Leica Microsystems) to increase the temperature to 10  C over the course of 410 d. Cryovial caps were left slightly loose to vent nitrogen gas. Once the temperature reached 10  C, cryovials were removed, opened, and tissues were transferred to tissue baskets (SPI microporous specimen capsules, 120200  m pore size; Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) while submerged in chilled (4  C) methanol. This transfer took place at ambient room temperature; the chilled methanol submersion is enough to maintain the integrity of the tissues. Indi vidual baskets were labeled using pencil on a small piece of paper approximately 2 mm 2 , as external labels were removed during the drying phase. Drying oc- curred via liquid CO 2 critical point drying (CPD; Bal-Tec CPD 030; Leica Micro- systems). Eleven quick-cycled washes replaced most of the loading methanol Applications in Plant Sciences 2013 1 ( 8 ): 1300034 Schultz et al.Space ight RNA later Arabidopsis SEM doi:10.3732apps.1300034 3 of 5 http:www.bioone.orgloiapps Hansma et al., 1989 ; Ushiki et al., 2012 ). Due to the high ionic content of RNA later and the necessity for an ionic submersion liquid for SICM, it is possible that this instrument could gen-erate comparable images without any tissue processing. This a cryo- holder, seen in Tang et al. (2012) , which may prove to be an acceptable alternative step in this protocol if the SEM being used can handle the LN 2 vapors. A third alternative is scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM; Marti et al., 1988 ; Fig. 1. Preliminary RNA later - xation investigations.
