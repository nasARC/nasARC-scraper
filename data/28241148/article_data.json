Although many neurodegenerative-disease proteins can be found in mitochondria4,6, it remains unclear how these disease manifestations may be related. In yeast, protein aggregates formed under stress or during aging are preferentially retained by the mother cell in part through tethering to mitochondria, while the disaggregase Hsp104 helps dissociate aggregates to enable refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins710. Here we show that in yeast cytosolic proteins prone to aggregation are imported into mitochondria for degradation. Protein aggregates formed under heat shock (HS) contain both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and interact with mitochondrial import complex. Many aggregation-prone proteins enter mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix after HS, while some do so even without stress. Timely dissolution of cytosolic aggregates requires mitochondrial import machinery and proteases. Blocking mitochondrial import but not the proteasome activity causes a marked delay in the degradation of aggregated proteins. Defects in cytosolic Hsp70s leads to enhanced entry of misfolded proteins into mitochondria and elevated mitochondrial stress.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptWe developed an affinity-based method, using GFP and Flag-tagged luciferase (FlucSM- GFP-3xFlag), a model aggregation substrate11, to purify protein aggregates induced by HS and identify their components by quantitative Multi-Dimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) comparing the experimental strain with the control lacking the Flag tag (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b,c). 319 proteins were found to enrich significantly in HS- induced aggregates (Table S1, S2). These proteins are referred to as aggregate proteins (APs) hereafter. 45 of APs were observed to form visible aggregates after HS by using available GFP-tagged strains (Extended Data Fig. 1d). 18 APs found in our study overlap with those identified previously using differential centrifugation12. Gene ontology revealed significant enrichment in proteasome components, chaperones, RNA-binding proteins, stress granules, and mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 1a). Tom70 and Tom40, two mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) proteins involved in import13, were among the mitochondrial proteins co-purified with aggregates. Microscopy revealed Tom70-GFP to be evenly distributed on mitochondrial membrane rather than colocalizing with aggregates (Extended Data Fig. 1e), but the biochemical interaction of Tom70 and Tom40 with aggregates was verified (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g). We showed previously that chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential required for import14, but not antimycin, which blocks mitochondrial ATP production, prevented the dissolution of Hsp104-GFP-labeled aggregates9. CCCP also disrupted dissolution of FlucSM-GFP aggregates in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), without depleting cellular ATP (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i)15,16. We therefore hypothesized that aggregate dissolution involves import of APs into mitochondria. To test this, we compared dissolution kinetics of HS aggregates in wild type (wt) or tim23ts, a temperature-sensitive mutant of TIM23 , encoding a subunit of the mitochondrial inner-membrane (IM) import complex13,17. tim23ts was inactivated during HS and prevented aggregate dissolution after shifting back to 23 C in the presence of CHX (Fig. 1bc), and this delay was not due to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Extended Data Fig. 1j). To visualize the entry of APs into mitochondria, we employed the split GFP system18 where the first 10  strands of GFP (GFP 1-10), linked with mCherry, was targeted to mitochondria through linkage with a mitochondria-targeting sequence19 (MTS-mCherry-GFP 1-10), while the 11th  strand (GFP 11) was linked with an AP (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Mitochondrial GFP fluorescence was only expected if the latter entered mitochondria. For positive and negative controls, GFP 11-tagged Grx5, a mitochondrial matrix protein, showed prominent mitochondrial split-GFP signal, whereas GFP 11-tagged Hsp104 or non-aggregate cytosolic protein Not3 (Extended Data Fig. 1d) showed no mitochondrial split-GFP signal with or without HS (Extended Data Fig. 2b). GFP 11-tagged APs, including FlucSM and several native APs, showed no or low-level mitochondrial GFP fluorescence before HS, but after HS the mitochondrial split-GFP signal increased dramatically (Fig. 2ac; Extended Data Fig. 2c), and this increase could be prevented by CCCP (Extended Data Fig. 2df). Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) applied to a strain, in which mitochondrial OM was labeled with Fis1TM-mCherry9 and GFP 1-10 was targeted into mitochondria by linking to Grx5, confirmed that the split GFP signal was indeed inside mitochondria (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Video 1). Mitochondrial import under HS was also observed for TDP-43 expressed in yeast, a protein associated with several forms of neurodegeneration20 (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h). Ruan et al. Page 2 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptInterestingly, ssa2,3,4 ssa1ts mutations21 disrupting cytosolic Hsp70 proteins led to import of FlucSM with or without HS (Fig. 2e), whereas disrupting Hsp104 activity with GdnHCl22 reduced the amount of imported FlucSM-GFP 11 (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j), suggesting that Hsp104 but not Hsp70s is involved in mitochondrial import of APs. To biochemically examine the import of APs into mitochondria, mitochondria were purified from cells expressing FlucSM-HA after HS. Sequential trypsin and protease K treatments were used to eliminate the substantial amount of aggregates attached to the outside of mitochondria (Extended Data Fig. 2km). Mitochondrial OM and IM were permeabilized with digitonin or Triton X-100, respectively23,24. Immunoblots of FlucSM, and markers of OM (Tom70), intermembrane space (Dld1) and matrix (Abf2) revealed FlucSM to be present in both intermembrane space and matrix (Extended Data Fig. 2ln). As an alternative method, MTS-GFP-APEX2 (Extended Data Fig. 2o,p) was introduced into the strain with a native AP, Tma19, tagged with HA at its genomic locus. After cell permeabilization, the mitochondrial matrix was briefly biotinylated, followed by extensive washes, removal of mitochondrial inner membrane and affinity purification of biotinylated proteins. AP protein Tma19-HA, but not the control (HA-tagged cytosolic Ppt1), was detected among the biotinylated proteins after but not before HS (Fig. 2f). During recovery at normal temperature after HS, the split-GFP signal of APs in mitochondria disappeared with kinetics similar to the dissolution of cytosolic aggregates (Fig. 3a,b, Extended Data Fig. 3a,b, compared to Fig. 1b), suggesting that degradation of APs imported into mitochondria accompanied aggregate dissolution. To test this biochemically, aggregates purified from the strain expressing FlucSM-HA-GFP-3xFlag were incubated with protease inhibitors and purified mitochondria (labeled with mCherry). As expected, aggregates and mitochondria clustered together (Extended Data Fig. 3c). FlucSM- HA-GFP-3xFlag degradation was observed after 1.5-hour incubation, as shown by the marked decrease of the full-length protein accompanied by the appearance of a cleavage product, in the reactions with wt mitochondria, but not those without mitochondria or when mitochondria from tim23ts mutant were used (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 3d). Furthermore, FlucSM-HA-GFP-3xFlag in aggregates purified from the hsp104 strain was not degraded by wt mitochondria (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). This result confirmed that degradation of FlucSM in aggregates required import-competent mitochondria and Hsp104. We next screened the 13 non-essential mitochondrial proteases, processing peptidases or oligopeptidases25 for their effect on the dissolution of HS aggregates. Deletion of PIM1 , encoding a LON protease showed the strongest inhibitory effect (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). To test the role of Pim1 further, we introduced into the genome the pim1S1015A mutation, which disrupts Pim1s proteolytic activity26. This mutant showed normal mitochondrial morphology and growth (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4ab), but the disappearance of FlucSM split-GFP signal in mitochondria during recovery was delayed compared to wt cells without or with CHX that prevented further production of APs9 (Fig. 3a, b; Extended Data Fig. 4c, d). To estimate the contribution of mitochondrial import to the turnover of APs relative to other mechanisms, we compared the degradation kinetics of FlucSM-HA, as well as Lsg1-HA, Ruan et al. Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptafter HS in the presence of CHX combined with MG132 (inhibiting proteasome), PMSF (inhibiting serine proteases in the vacuole), or CCCP, in the pdr5 strain with enhanced drug permeability27,28. CCCP strongly delayed the degradation of FlucSM and Lsg1 after HS (Fig. 3d, e and Extended Data Fig. 4e, f). Consistently, inhibition of import with tim23ts also delayed FlucSM turnover after HS (Extended Data Fig. 4g, h). By contrast, MG132 had little effect on AP degradation after HS, even though the drug efficacy was confirmed by the inhibition of FlucSM degradation without HS (Extended Data Fig. 4i, j). PMSF moderately slowed down the degradation of Lsg1 and FlucSM. This experiment shows a substantial contribution of mitochondrial import to the degradation of APs after HS, while a lack of requirement for proteasome is consistent with the observation that many proteasome components were enriched in aggregates after HS (Fig. 1a). We next tested the effect of loss of cytosolic proteostasis in ssa2,3,4 ssa1ts mutant on AP clearance inside mitochondria. The split GFP signal in this mutant persisted after shifting back to 23C (Fig. 3f, g), likely due to continuous flow of misfolded FlucSM-GFP 11 into mitochondria, since CHX treatment enabled split-GFP-signal decay (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). Interestingly, this mutant also displayed much more severe and persistent fragmentation of mitochondria (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 5c) and high-level mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (ROS) compared to wt cells after HS (Fig. 3h, Extended Data Fig. 5d). These manifestations of mitochondrial stress were also observed in neurodegenerative diseases1,4,29. Although mitochondrial import of most APs tested occurred after HS, some, such as Ded1, a RNA helicase, showed prominent split-GFP signal in mitochondria even without HS (Extended Data Fig. 6ad, and e for additional examples). Ded1 was previously classified as a super aggregator with low stress threshold for aggregation12. After CCCP was added to prevent further import or CHX to prevent further synthesis, the split-GFP signal of Ded1, but not of the stable mitochondrial protein Grx5, diminished with time (Extended Data Fig. 6a d, 2b), suggesting that highly unstable cytosolic proteins are imported into and degraded in mitochondria even under physiological conditions. To test if import of aggregation-prone proteins into mitochondria occurs in mammalian cells, we fused HA-GFP 11 to luciferase (FlucWT), and two mutants, FlucSM and FlucDM, of which FlucDM has the highest structural instability11. Each construct, or GST-HA-GFP 11 as another control for stable protein, was co-transfected with a plasmid expressing MTS-mCherry-GFP 1-10 into human RPE1 cells. GST-HA-GFP 11 or FlucWT-HA-GFP 11 produced no or minimal split-GFP fluorescence, whereas FlucSM-HA-GFP 11 and FlucDM-HA-GFP 11 showed increasingly strong split-GFP fluorescence in mitochondria (Fig. 4a, b), even though the protein levels of FlucWT, FlucSM and FlucDM were in a decreasing order due to instability of the mutants11 (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 6f), suggesting that unstable aggregation-prone cytosolic proteins are also imported into mitochondria in human cells. Taken together, we speculate that protein aggregates engaged with mitochondria via interaction with import receptors such as Tom70, leading to import of APs followed by degradation by mitochondrial proteases such as Pim1 (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Import of APs appears not to require cytosolic Hsp70, but Hsp104 is involved, possibly by dissociating proteins from aggregates to enable their entry into import channels. Since blocking Ruan et al. Page 4 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptmitochondrial import prevented dissaggregation in vivo , the mitochondrial import process may facilitate disaggregation by actively removing dissociated proteins from aggregates although we cannot rule out an indirect effect. While mechanistic details require further investigation, our findings establish mitochondria as an important guardian of cytosolic proteostasis and we term this mechanism MAGIC. In yeast, MAGIC appears to be crucial for the turnover of proteins that aggregate under stress. If this also happens in human cells, it could suggest the accumulation of certain disease proteins in mitochondria4 to reflect a general deficiency in cellular proteostasis30. A resulting overabundance of disease or misfolded proteins inside mitochondria could disrupt mitochondrial biosynthetic activities or overwhelm mitochondrias own proteostasis, leading to organelle dysfunction. On the other hand, the decline of mitochondrial fitness in aging or disease could lead to diminished MAGIC due to loss of membrane potential or protein degradation capacity, leading to impeded cytosolic proteostasis and buildup of protein aggregates.

Gene deletion, HA, GFP 11 and GFP tagging were performed with PCR mediated homologous recombination31 and correct integrations were confirmed by PCR. pim1S1015A:PIM1 was constructed by integration of plasmid carries pim1S1015A under PIM1 promotor into PIM1 locus. Plasmids containing FlucWT, FlucSM and FlucDM were constructed using the plasmids kindly provided by Dr. Franz-Ulrich Hartl (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry)32. pRS306-LuciYFP was a gift from Dr. Bernd Bukau (Heidelberg University). Tdp43 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Jiou Wangs lab (Johns Hopkins University). Most of the expression plasmids were constructed based on the p404 backbone33. The verification of MudPIT hits was done with the strains from the yeast GFP library34. Split- GFP systems DNA fragments were synthesized by gBlocks (Cabantous et al., 2005). GFP1-10 was in frame with mitochondria targeting sequence (MTS) and mCherry. GFP 11 replaced GFP in pFA6a-GFP (S65T)-His3MX6 to serve as the universal C-terminal tagging plasmid. APEX2 was in frame with MTS-GFP. For SIM assay, mitochondrial outer membrane was labeled with mCherry-Fis1TM35; GFP 1-10 was fused with the mitochondrial matrix protein Grx5 (Grx5- GFP 1-10); the native aggregate protein Lsg1 was tagged with GFP 11. For mammalian plasmids, MTS-mCherry-GFP1-10 replaced the DsRed in pDsRed- Monomer-Hyg-N1 vector; GST-HA-GFP 11, FlucWT-HA-GFP 11, FlucSM-HA-GFP 11 or FlucDM-HA-GFP 11 replaced the GFP in pAcGFP1-N1 vector, respectively. Confocal microscopy Live-cell images of yeast were acquired using either a Yokagawa (Tokyo, Japan) CSU-10 spinning disc on the side port of a Carl Zeiss (Jena, Germany) 200m inverted microscope or Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA) Ultraview V oX system equipped with Zeiss Definite Focus, or a Carl Zeiss LSM-510 Confocor 3 system. 488561 nm excitation was used to excite GFP RFPs, and emission was collected through the appropriate filters onto a Hamamatsu Ruan et al. Page 5 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptC9100-13 EMCCD on the spinning disc systems or the single photon avalanche photodiodes on the Confocor 3. All GFP images were acquired through a 500550 nm filter. RFP images were acquired with a 580 nm long pass filter on the CSU-10, and a 420475502544582 618663691 multiband filter on the Ultraview. All images were acquired in a multi-track, alternating excitation configuration so as to avoid GFP bleed through. The CSU-10 and Ultraview systems utilized a 100 1.45 NA Plan-Apochromat objective. Images were acquired using MetaMorph (version 7.0; MDS Analytical Technologies) on CSU-10 spinning disc system, V olocity 6.3 (Perkin Elmer) on Ultraview system and Carl Zeiss AIM software for the LSM 510. Mammalian cell images were acquired using Zeiss LSM780 confocal (Jena, Germany) with 40X1.4 oil Plan-Apochromat objective. Yeast cells were grown in synthetic complete (SC) or drop-out media containing 2 dextrose overnight at 30 C (23 C for ts mutants). The 4 ml (or 8 ml for recovery assays) mid-log culture with OD 600 of roughly 0.5 was transferred to 42 C to be heat-shocked for 30 min. For 3D fluorescence time-lapse imaging, cells were placed on a thin SC (2 dextrose) agarose gel pad to allow for prolonged imaging at room temperature36. 3D image stacks were acquired every minute for 6090 min. Each z-series was acquired with 0.5- micron step size. All image processing was performed using the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). For visualization purposes, images in the figure were scaled with bilinear interpolation. Drug treatments and antibodies Cycloheximide (C4859, Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 gml. Hydrogen peroxide solution (216763, Sigma) was diluted 10 times in H 2O and added to a final concentration of 0.7 mM at 30 C to induce protein aggregation. CCCP (C2759, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO or ethanol to 20 mM as stock and 25M was used to treat cells. MG132 (c2211, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO and 80 M was used to treat cells. PMSF (P7626, Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and 1 mM was used to treat cells. DHE staining was done by incubating cells with 180 M DHE (D11347, Invitrogen) for 10min at room temperature. Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate (TMRM, T5428, Sigma) was added to a final concentration 1 M for 30 minutes at 30 C. Anti-HA-Peroxidase in APEX assay was from Sigma (12013819001). HA-Tag (C29F4) Rabbit mAb 3724 from Cell Signaling Technique was used in all the other immunoblots. Anti-GFP was from MBL International Corporation (598). Guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma G3272) 3 mM was added during heat shock. Anti-Tom70 antibody, anti-Dld1 antibody and anti-Abf2 antibody were kindly provided by Steven Claypools lab (Johns Hopkins University). Aggregate dissolution assay Aggregate dissolution assays were done as described previously37. Briefly, yeast cells were heat shocked at 42 C for 30 min and recovered for 15min at 30 C or 23 C (for ts mutants) with or without additional drug such as CHX or CCCP before mounted on an agarose gel- pad slide for 3D time-lapse imaging. The major technical flow is as follows: after generating masks of the aggregates, cell areas and cytoplasm were created and used to calculate the average intensity of aggregate regions (including cytosolic background), average cytosolic intensity, and total aggregates area. The average cytosolic intensity was subtracted from the Ruan et al. Page 6 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptaverage aggregate region intensity to obtain the corrected average aggregate intensity without cytosolic background. Finally, the total aggregate intensity was calculated by multiplying the corrected average aggregates intensity by the aggregate area and normalized to the initial intensity for comparison between strains or conditions. Aggregate intensities were measured starting at 30 minutes after the start of acquisition because during the early part of the movies aggregates grew in intensity as explained in detail previously37. Measurement of cellular ATP level using FRET-based biosensor FRET measurement of cellular ATP level was performed by using the acceptor photobleaching method as described previously35. Briefly, yeast cells expressing AT1.0338 were heat-shocked at 42 C for 30 min and recovered with or without indicated compounds for 0 min, 30 min or 60 min. Cells were then immobilized on a glass slide and imaged using a Perkin-Elmer Ultraview spinning disc system with a CSU-X1 Yokogawa disc. A 100X 1.4 NA Plan-apochromatic objective was used, and emission was collected onto a C9100 Hamamatsu Photonics EM-CCD. CFP was excited with a 440 nm laser, and emission was collected through a 456484 nm band pass filter. All FRET efficiency was normalized to the mean of CHX treated group. Purification of protein aggregates 240 mL yeast culture (FlucSM-GFP or FlucSM-GFP-3xFlag) with OD around 0.5 were heat shocked in 42 C water bath or treated with 0.7 mM H 2O2 for desired period of time. After HS or H 2O2, CHX and CCCP were added to prevent aggregate formation and dissolution. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 2 min and the pellet was washed once with water, re-suspended in 1mL 10 mM DTT (100 mM Tris-H 2SO4, PH 9.3) for 5min at 30 C. Then the cells were washed once with sorbitol buffer (20 mM K 2HPO 4KH 2PO4, PH 7.5, 1.2 M Sorbitol), followed by 5 min digestion with 0.7 mgmL zymolase100T (US biological) in 1 mL zymolyase buffer. Zymolyase was removed by centrifugation (800 g) and cells were washed twice with zymolyase buffer. Cells were lysed with 800 l ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES PH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5 glycerol, 1 Triton- X100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (roche 11836170001) and 10 UmL RNasin plus RNase Inhibitor (N2611) by pipetting 1520 times on ice. 2min centrifugation at 800 g was followed by 1min 6,000 g centrifugation to remove cell debris. The supernatant was carefully transferred to the top of sucrose gradient consisting of 650 l 50, 2 mL 20 and 1 mL 10 sucrose dissolved in the lysis buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 16 min. 18-gauge needles were used to insert into 20 sucrose fraction from the side of centrifuge tube to collect about 900 l 20 sucrose fraction. The entire 900 l 20 fraction was directly applied to the column prefilled with about 600 l M2 resin (A2220, sigma) prepared in cold room according to the manufacturers instruction. The column was then washed 20 times with 1 mL cold wash buffer (1xTBS contain 10 UmL RNasin plus). Then the beads were carefully transferred into a new 2 mL tube, gently inverted 1015 times and left on rack for about 5 min-10 min to separate beads from wash buffer. The supernatant was replaced with fresh wash buffer. The beads were then loaded back to column and incubated with 650 l of 1xTBS supplemented with 2 SDS for 5 min on bench before elution. To examine Tom70 and Tom40 in the purified aggregates, we engineered HA tag to the C- termini of Tom40, Tom70, Om45, Mdm10 and Mdm34, respectively, in FlucSM-Ruan et al. Page 7 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptGFP-3xFlag background; Tom40 and Tom70 in FlucSM-GFP background. Similar amounts of aggregates purified from 7 different strains were used to detect Tom70 and Tom40. MudPIT Analysis TCA-precipitated proteins were urea-denatured, reduced, alkylated and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche) followed by modified trypsin (Promega)39, 40. Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 250 m fused silica microcapillary columns packed with strong cation exchange resin (Luna, Phenomenex) and 5 m C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex), and then connected to a 100 m fused silica microcapillary column packed with 5 m C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex)39. Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump and a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoScientific, San Jose, CA). Fully automated 10-step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides, as described in (Florens and Washburn, 2006). Tandem mass (MSMS) spectra were interpreted using SEQUEST41 against a database consisting of 6019 nonredundant yeast proteins (NCBI, 2013-02-26 release), 160 usual contaminants (human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes). To estimate false discovery rates (FDR)s, the amino acid sequence of each non-redundant protein entry was randomized to generate a virtual library. This resulted in a total library of 12038 non-redundant sequences against which the spectra were matched. Peptidespectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect42 with the following criteria set: Spectrapeptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08, and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly-, 2.0 for doubly-, and 3.0 for triply-charged spectra. In addition, peptides had to be fully tryptic and at least 7 amino acids long. Combining all runs, proteins had to be detected by at least 2 such peptides, or 1 peptide with 2 spectra. Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST42. To estimate relative protein levels, distributed Normalized Spectral Abundance Factors (dNSAFs) were calculated for each detected proteinprotein group, as described43. Table S1 and S2 were generated by filtering the hits with stringent cutoff (FDR0.05 and were identified in 3 out of 4 repeats for 30 min HS, 2 out of 2 repeats for other samples). The average dNSAF was used to calculate percentage of aggregate proteins identified in each condition. The aggregate proteins that can be found in a previous published mitochondrial proteome44 were included to calculate the percentage of mitochondrial protein in 30min HS sample. Mammalian cell culture, transfection and Immunoblots Human RPE1 (ATCC CRL4000) cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEMF12) (GIBCO), supplemented with 10 (vv) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IUml penicillin. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instruction. RPE1 cells were double transfected with MTS-mCherry-GFP1-10 and protein of interest that tagged with GFP 11 (2.5g of each plasmid were applied). After 24 hours of transfection, each sample was equally divided into a new plate and a MatTek (P35G-0-14-C) dish, for western blot and imaging after another 24 hours, respectively. The cell line has been tested as mycoplasma negative.Ruan et al. Page 8 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptSplit GFP assay and quantification In yeast, protein of interest was tagged with GFP 11 at C terminus of its genomic locus in the strain that carries MTS-mCherry-GFP 1-10. Yeast cells were grown and imaged as described above. HS was performed at 42 C in 4 ml culture for 30 min with shaking of 220 rpm. 1 ml of yeast culture was directly taken out and imaged after HS. Post HS cultures were shaking with 220 rpm at 30 C when indicated time points were acquired (with new medium were added to the culture to keep the OD600 below 0.5 all the time). For CCCP treatment, log phase yeast was treated with 25 M CCCP at 30 C for 15 min. For CHX treatment, log phase yeast was treated with 100 gml CHX at 30 C for 30 min. All the images were acquired with same laser and exposure setting. RPE1 cells were double transfected with Split-GFP constructs as described above. Cells were located using mCherry channel only. Quantification of split-GFP fluorescence was done using a custom python code, which can be found within the git repository located at https:github.comRongLiLab image_analysis_and_quantificationblobmasterRuan_Zhou_2016_zstack_analysis.py . Briefly, after reading the mCherry and GFP channel z-stacks, the intensities were summed along the z-axis. The resulting 2D image in the GFP channel was then subject to the random walk segmentation in order to segment out the yeast cells from background and watershed segmentation to separate adjacent cells. The segmentation algorithms were taken from the scikit-image library. Following the segmentation, the median GFP and mCherry intensity in each cell was calculated. Cells whose median GFP is significantly superior to the five cells with lowest GFP in the image are eliminated from further analysis, since they correspond to auto-fluorescence of dying cells. For each cell, mCherry channel was thresholded at 5 of maximal value in order to detect the mitochondria, and median GFP intensity within mitochondria was calculated. This median GFP intensity and mCherry intensity were used in the following analyses. For yeast quantification of fraction of cells that had the split-GFP signal, all images were acquired with same microscopy setting. Different time points of each sample were set with the same minimum and maximum display value. Maximal z-projection images were used to count the number of total cell and cells with distinct split-GFP that co-localize with mitochondria mCherry. At least 9 fields from 3 different experiments were quantified at each time point. Worth noting is that, when using cells recovered from frozen glycerol stocks, about 5 of yeast in FlucSM-GFP 11 showed nuclear GFP signal, but not mCherry signal. Those cells were eliminated from quantification in both cell counting and GFPmCherry intensity ratio quantification. Quantification of the cells with intact mitochondria Quantification was done with another custom analysis pipeline and the python code can be found within the git repository located at https:github.comRongLiLab image_analysis_and_quantificationblobmasterRuan_Zhou_2016_zstack_analysis.py . Global Otsu threshold is then applied to the maximum projection of mCherry channel to identify the locations of the mitochondria and the resulting binary mask is then segmented to determine projections of individual mitochondria. Following that, each binary label corresponding to an individual mitochondrion is skeletonized by morphological thinning in Ruan et al. Page 9 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptorder to qualify its morphological structure (circular fragments of mitochondria v.s. elongated mitochondria). Following this, for every binary label, the length of the skeleton and total area covered is computed and used as a basis to classify the region it spans as either intact mitochondria or fragmented mitochondria. Skeleton longer than 20 pixels and total area larger than 25 pixels were used as cutoff for intact mitochondria. APEX experiment GFP-APEX2 was cloned from a plasmid from Dr. Alice Y . Ting lab (MIT, Massachusetts) and the following protocol was derived from the original protocol for mammalian cell culture45. MTS-GFP-APEX2 was introduced into the TRP1 locus of the strains expressing HA-tagged cytosolic proteins identified in aggregates. 4 mL of the mid-log culture was heat- shocked for 30 min at 42C. The cell wall was reduced by incubating with 10 mM DTT (pH 9.5) for 5 min and cells were washed with zymolyase buffer (pH 7.5, 0.6 M sorbitol, 150 mM NaCl). After re-suspending the cells in zymolyase buffer, zymolyase (0.2 mgmL), saponin (0.5 mgmL) and biotin-phenol (BP) (500 M) were added for 10 min to remove the cell wall and permeabilize plasma membrane to allow BP to access mitochondria. The completion of cell permeablization was verified microscopically. H 2O2 (1 mM) was added for 1 min to activate biotinylation of mitochondrial proteomeby APEX2. Cells were then washed three times with reducing buffer (10 mM sodium ascorbate, 5 mM Trolox and 10 mM sodium azide in zymolyase buffer) to stop biotinylation and remove free BP. In this step, the pellet fraction containing organelles, including mitochondria, was separated from cytosolic proteins by centrifugation. After re-suspending the organelles in 100 l zymolyase buffer, 1 mL cold lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 Triton x100 and 1x protein inhibitor (04693159001 ROCHE)) was added to lyse the cells for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation for 10 min at 15,500 g, the lysate was incubated 30 min at room temperature with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, 11205D) prepared according to manufacturers instruction and washed 55 min with PBS supplemented with 0.1 tween-20 and 1 mgmL BSA. The biotinylated proteins were released from beads by incubating with sample buffer (1x NuPAGE sample buffer (NP0007) supplemented with 20 mM DTT and 2 mM D-biotin) for 10 min at 95 C. Mitochondrial isolation and in vitro import assay Mitochondria purification was based on a previous protocol46. Briefly, yeast cells expressing MTS-mCherry (in wt and tim23ts background) were cultured in 10 liter lactate medium (3 gL yeast extract, 0.5 gL glucose, 0.5 gL CaCl 2-H20, 0.5 gL NaCl, 0.6 gL MgCl 2-6H 20, 1 gL KH 2PO4, 1 gL NH 4Cl, 22 mlL 90 Lactic acid, adjust to PH 5.5 with NaOH) to OD600 of 1. Cells were collected by centrifugation and treated with Tris-DTT buffer (0.1 M Tris, 10 mM DTT, adjust PH to 9.4). After washing with SP buffer (1.2 M Sorbital, 20 mM KPi, pH7.4), cells were treated with 0.5 mgml zymolase100T (US biological) at 30 C for 40 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted, washed with the SP buffer, and then resuspended in regeneration buffer (1.2 M Sorbitol, 1 x Lactate media without glucose) in order to isolate robust mitochondria. For the protease protection assay, regeneration step was skipped. Spheroplasts were then washed with the SEH buffer (0.6M Sorbital, 20 mM HEPES-KOH of pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM EGTA of pH8.0, protease cocktail (P2714, Sigma), 10 M Benzamidine-HCl (B6506), 1 gml 1,10-Phenanthroline (P9375), PMSF 1 mM was added Ruan et al. Page 10 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptbefore use) and broken with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 g (low-speed) for 5 min at 4 C. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 g (high-speed) for 10 min at 4 C. This step was repeated with resuspending the first low- speed pellet and breaking it with Dounce again. The homogenate was centrifuged with low- speed and high-speed as described above. The high-speed pellet was collected and the Dounce homogenization was repeated with a loose-fitting pestle. The final high-speed pellet contained the crude mitochondria was carefully transferred to a Nycodenz gradient in Beckman 14  89 mm Ultra-Clear Centrifuge tubes (344059). The gradient consisted of 2.1 ml 25, 2.1 ml 20, 2.1 ml 15, 2.1 ml 10, and 2.1 ml 5 Nycodenz from bottom to top. The gradient was ultracentrifuged in a Swinging bucket rotor (Beckman SW41 rotor) for 60 min at 4 C with speed at 30,000 rpm. Mitochondria were concentrated around 16 Nycodenz and appeared as a wide red-brownish band in the fourth layer counting from the top. Aggregates were purified based on the method described above but with two changes. First, the strains used here (both wt and hsp104 deletion background) expressed FlucSM-HA- GFP-3xFlag-3xFKBP-Myc. The motif 3xFKBP was originally included because we thought induced binding may be necessary for import of aggregate proteins in vitro, but we found that aggregates naturally bind mitochondria without any artificial method needed (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Second, we used the crude aggregate fraction from the sucrose gradient without the affinity purification in order to obtain sufficient free aggregates for the in vitro import assay. The mitochondria import assay in vitro was detailed described previously47. Briefly, purified mitochondria 10 mgml were pre-treated with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P2714, Cell Signaling Technology 5872S) for 15 min and mixed with aggregates in import buffer (3 wv Fatty acid-free BSA, 250 mM Sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM KH 2PO4, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH7.2, 10 M ATP). We note that the ATP requirement in our assay was much lower than that in previous work48, 49. This could be due to possible ATP production by the mitochondria in the assay, leading to increased ATP levels that are sufficient to support Hsp104 activity, or due to a different mechanistic action of Hsp104 in our assay system. The aggregate to mitochondria volume ratio was 1:10 (3 l 125 gml aggregates from sucrose gradient to 30 l 10 mgml mitochondria). Aggregates concentration was measured and adjusted by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific 23225) and confirmed by imaging of GFP labeled FlucSM punctas density. Same amount of mixture was taken out at indicated time points up to 1.5 hour and boiled 15 min in SDS sample buffer for immune blot analysis. Protease protection assay Mitochondria from the strain expressing FlucSM-HA were purified based on above protocol in Mitochondrial isolation and in vitro import assay , after heat shock at 42C. The only difference was no regeneration step after inducing spheroplasts. Purified mitochondria was washed 3 time with import buffer without ATP (3 wv Fatty acid-free BSA, 250 mM Sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM KH 2PO4, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH7.2) to get rid of protease inhibitor. Then the mitochondria were spin down in 4C 13000rpm for 10 minutes. Mitochondria were resuspended and same amount was added to 4 different 1.5 ml tubes. Group 1 without any treatment as total mitochondria. Group 2 was treated with Ruan et al. Page 11 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptTrypsin for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) continued with protease K treatment for another 1 hour at RT to assess the protection by mitochondrial outer membrane. Group 3 was added with digitonin to permeabilize outer membrane and Group 4 was added with both digitonin and Triton-X100 to permeabilize inner membrane. Then group 3 and 4 underwent same proteases treatment as Group 2. The volume difference was equalized with SEH buffer. Immediately after the treatment, all the samples were added with PMSF and boiled 15 minutes in SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. CHX chase assay Log phase yeast expressing FlucSM-HA in TIM23 and tim23ts backgrounds, expressing FlucSM-HA or Lsg1-HA in pdr5 background were heat-shocked at 42C for 30 minutes. Recovery at 30 C (23 C for tim23ts groups) was performed in the presence of 100 gml CHX and indicated drugs (50 M CCCP, 1 mM PMSF, 80 M MG132). At indicated time points, same amount of yeast cells were collected and lysed followed by 15 minutes boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Yeast growth assays 3 single colonies of both wild type cells and pim1S1015A:PIM1 cells were inoculated in YPD and YPG (YP plus glycerol) at 30 C overnight. The cultures were then diluted to same OD of 0.075 to refresh for 3 hours at 30 C in order to enter log phase. Then the OD adjusted wild type cells and pim1S1015A:PIM1 cells were plated on YPD and YPG plates. Cells were spotted at 10x serial dilutions from left to right and cultured in 30 C incubator for 44 hours on YPD plate and 60 hours on YPG plate before scanning. Structured illumination microscopy Mitochondrial outer membrane was labeled with mCherry-Fis1TM. GFP1-10 was fused with the mitochondrial matrix protein Grx5 (Grx5-GFP1-10). The native aggregate protein Lsg1 was tagged with GFP11. After 30 min heat shock at 42 C, the split GFP signal was imaged with mitochondria by using the Nikon structured illumination microscope (Nikon, N-SIM) with the 100x TIRF objective. 3D reconstruction was done using the Elements N- SIM software. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 6.0. For the yeast cell data, unpaired Students t test was used to determine significant differences between samples. For the mammalian cell imaging data, Dunns multiple comparisons test (nonparametric distribution) was used to determine significant differences between samples; for the mammalian cell immunoblot results, Tukeys multiple comparisons test nonparametric distribution) was used to determine significant differences between samples (significance levels: () for p  0.05, () for p  0.01, () for p  0.001).
