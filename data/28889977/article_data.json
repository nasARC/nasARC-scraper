Graphical abstract Keywords Drosophila; immune suppression; hemocytes; parasitoid wasps; venom; virus-like particles; secretion systems; T3 secretion system; proteomics; mixed strategy extracellular vesicles RESULTS Sister Leptopilina species produce different VLPs Larvae of parasitic wasps of the Leptopilina genus feed on Drosophila larval host tissues, and eclose into free-living adults (Fig 1 A). The VLP-producing generalistspecialist L. heterotoma (Lh)L. boulardi (Lb) wasps differ greatly in their infection of their natural host D. melanogaster , as seen in the anterior lobes of the fly larval lymph glands. Hematopoietic progenitors are housed in the glands medulla (marked by Dome-Meso-GFP ) and mature hemocytes, in the cortex (GFP-negative, Fig 1 B). Lb 17 infection induces lamellocyte differentiation (Fig 1 C), while Lh 14 attack causes cell loss in both the medulla and the cortex, and few cells survive (Fig 1 D). The differences in the virulence of Lh versus Lb is attributed to differences in the VLPs produced by these wasps  7 and the mechanism of Lh- induced cell killing are not understood. VLPs from Lb 17 and Lh 14 differ in morphology; Lb 17 VLPs have fewer spikes and are somewhat larger than Lh VLPs (Fig 1 E, F)  8. A peripheral membrane lipid bilayer ( 10 nm) surrounds Lh VLPs, which lack the typical Heavner et al. Page 2 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcoat-like structure found in some viruses (Fig 1 G). Because of their key role in wasp parasitism of Drosophila spp.  4, 5, we hypothesized that differences in the composition of spiked particles produced in the venom of both wasps underlie these contrasting infection strategies. To characterize Lh VLP proteomes and examine differences in VLP protein compositions fundamental to Lh- versus Lb-specific virulence, we identified a high-confidence proteomic dataset common to VLPs from two independently-isolated, isogenized strains ( Lh 14 and Lh NY), whose fine structures and activities on host cells are indistinguishable  3, 9. Peptide sequences from each VLP proteome ( Lh 14 and Lh NY wasps) were first aligned against RNA-Seq Lh 14 transcripts  10, translated to open reading frames (ORFs). We thus obtained a common set of Lh VLP proteins (present in both proteomes; Tables S1, S2) and verified these VLP protein sequences at  90 identity against two Lh expressed sequence tags (ESTs;  30 proteins or 20  11 and  70 proteins or 45  12 of the common proteome). To identify candidate pathogenicity effectors, we compared the common Lh VLP dataset to abdominal transcripts of Lb 17 and a distantly-related species Ganaspis sp.1 (G1) that lacks spiked VLPs  10, 11, 13 (Fig 2). A summary of our major findings follows. Lh VLPs are rich in eukaryotic microvesicular proteins No proteins with significant homology to structural proteins of any known virus, including polydnaviruses (PDVs) associated with ichneumonid and braconid wasps, which prey on Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera  14, were found in the Lh proteome. The 161 proteins common to Lh 14 and Lh NY VLP proteomes were categorized as (1) conserved eukaryotic proteins with core biological function (42, Class 1); (2) virulenceimmunity- associated proteins (24, Class 2); or (3) novel sequences (34, Class 3) (Figs 2, 3 A). Of the  160 VLP proteins, 25 are Lh-specific (i.e., they are not expressed by Lb 17 10) and most (2741, 66) of these proteins are novel (Class 3) (Fig 2). Class 1 sequences contain orthologs of Drosophila and mammalian extra- and intracellular vesicle (including microvesicle and exosome) components as well as membrane proteins (Fig 3 A  C). The presence of transmembrane (e.g., NaK pump, SERCA calcium pump) and vesicle transport proteins (e.g., H-ATPase, heat shock cognate 70, Rab proteins, and soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) (Figs 2, 3 A  C) in the proteome suggest that Lh VLPs are not viral but instead share functional properties with eukaryotic extracellular organelles called microvesicles, produced by animals cells, and specialized to transfer proteins between different cell types  15. Diverse pathogenicity mechanisms are housed in VLPs Candidate immune-modulating (Class 2) VLP proteins include two diedel-like proteins with high similarities to sequences from insect viruses (60 and 62 similarity to NP_059254.1, Xestia c-nigrum granulovirus ; Fig 2; Data S1). Interestingly, a Drosophila diedel modulates the IMDNF- B-dependent antimicrobial cascade  16 and the VLP diedel proteins may similarly suppress host signaling. An Lh VLP enhancin-like protein shows similarity to Yersinia spp. enhancins (42 similarity to WP_012413443.1, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ; Fig 2; Data S1), although enhancins are also found in insect viruses  17. Additional Class 2 immunity and development proteins include: (1) imaginal disc growth factor 4-like sequence Heavner et al. Page 3 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript(Idgf4) (83 similarity to XP_008560038.1, Microplitis demolitor ); (2) fire ant (Solenopsis )-derived venom allergen (62 similarity to XP_008560038.1, Nasonia vitripennis ); and (3) B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (89 similarity to XP_008554920.1, Microplitis demolitor ) (Fig 2; Data S1). Two VLP proteins may protect and regulate parasite development: an antimicrobialantifungal-like knottin protein (46 similarity to XP_014233229.1, Trichogramma pretiosum ) and a predicted hemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (56 similarity to ABV82429.1, Drosophila melanogaster ) (Fig 2; Data S1)  11. In the Class 2 set, we also identified two families of invertebrate immunity proteins (Figs 2, 3 A). At least 6 Lh RhoGAPs were found that, like Lb GAP of Lb 18, may inhibit parasite encapsulation. A group of 14 metalloendopeptidases (MEPs) were also identified in the proteome and, although they are structurally similar to proteins from diverse kingdoms, their virulence functions may be similar to those of MEPs from parasitic wasps Venturia canescens 19 and Nasonia vitripennis 20. The diversity of predicted activities of Class 2 proteins likely facilitates Lh success across a broad range of Drosophila spp. The abundance of novel proteins in Class 3 of the proteome was intriguing. Domain identifications predict viral domains (Pox L5 (PF04872), Baculo_PEP_C (PF04513.10), and Baculo_11_kDa (PF06143.9)) in three VLP sequences  21, 22. One of these, Baculo_11_kDa VLP sequence also shows similarity to phage tail tape measure proteins (data not shown). In addition to the multiple gene families in Lh VLPs that are common to Lb and G1 (e.g., RhoGAPs and MEPs; Figs 2, 3 A), Lh-specific gene families include fibronectin domain-containing sequences and a new family of GTPases (Figs 2, 3 A; Data S2). Multiple members of gene families are expressed in wasp venoms  2325, and identification of the gene families in Lh VLPs suggests that gene duplications and neofunctionalization underlie the powerful virulence strategy of Lh. Novel endomembrane-active GTPases Because the novel GTPase peptides are of high abundance in the Lh VLP proteomes and are absent from the Lb abdominal transcriptome, we investigated their predicted structures and functions in detail. All of the three small (SmGTPase) and five large GTPase (LgGTPase) sequences have N-terminal signals for secretion as well as key residues for GTP hydrolysis (Fig 4 A  C; Data S2). Five of the 8 (small and large) GTPase family members possess prokaryotic domains present in eubacterial andor archaeal (e.g., PF09488, Fig 4 A, A ) proteins. Beyond a few proteins from parasitic wasps ( N. vitripennis , G1, and L. clavipes ), the closest putative homologs of these GTPases are prokaryotic (Fig 4 B; Data S2). The predicted active site of a representative SmGTPase (SmGTPase01) coordinates GTP and the NTPase cofactor, Mg2. Close alignment of the predicted SmGTPase01 active site with the active site structure of HRas, the canonical small GTPase, supports the domain analyses results (Fig 4 A, A ,  C). The large GTPases are predicted to fold into C-terminal coiled- coils (Fig 4 A ). These findings suggest a curious blend of prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties within this new family of Lh VLP proteins, which likely have GTPase enzymatic activity and are likely secreted from wasp cells for incorporation into vesicles.Heavner et al.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptT3SS-like VLP proteins: Similarities between VLP p40 and bacterial SipDIpaD Prokaryotic protein motifs were identified in nearly 10 of novel Class 3 sequences. Overlapping protein motifs,  Bacillus PF05103; fungal PF15577 associated with cell division and microtubule binding, respectively, were identified in a single Class 3 protein. KEGG Mapper BlastKAOLA identified (a) Syd-like (SecY-interacting, Type 2 secretion systems) and (b) flgE-like (bacterial flagellar hook) proteins with low-to-mid scores. A sopE-like (bacterial GEF toxin) protein was also found. The presence of bacterial secretion system and flagellar proteins is especially interesting as these macromolecular assemblies are structurally and functionally related and the Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) of the self- assembling bacterial flagella are thought to be ancestral to the ones found in the needle injectisome of pathogens  26. Our previous antibody staining and inhibition studies uncovered an abundant 40 kDa surface protein of Lh VLPs (p40) which is necessary for lamellocyte lysis  9. Early in VLP biogenesis, p40 is associated with the membranes of canals that emanate from the cytoplasm of secretory cells of the venom gland, where it is synthesized. Once in the canal lumen, p40 is then associated with membranous vesicles that are released from secretory cells. The vesicles mature into spiked VLPs which carry p40 both on their surfaces and spikes  9, 27. The bacterial T3SS domain from IpaDSipDBipD (PRK15330, E  7.6005) proteins was found in residues 39-146 of p40 (Fig 4 D). This assignment was made by peptide mapping, cloning and expressing polyhistidine-tagged p40 in bacteria. In western blot experiments, anti-p40 antibody recognized this bacterially-expressed protein (Fig S1 A). As expected, p40 is detected in wasp venom extracts (Fig S1 B). We were unable to identify a putative Lb 17 or G1 p40 ortholog (Fig 2) and, to our knowledge, p40 represents the first eukaryotic protein with an IpaDSipD-like domain. IpaD-like proteins from ShigellaSalmonellaBurkholderia spp. are tip proteins of T3SS injectisomes, mediating contact and regulated delivery of effectors into the host cytoplasm of non-phagocytic cells  28. IpaD expression in mammalian macrophages triggers apoptosis 29, reminiscent of the TUNEL-positive death of fly macrophages upon Lh infection  7. Unlike the bacterial proteins, p40 is predicted to encode a C-terminal transmembrane helix in addition to an N-terminal secretion signal (Figs 4 D; S1 C). p40s transmembrane domain (this study) and its extracellular localization in venom gland canals  27 suggest that p40 exits venom gland secretory cells in association with microvesicle-like structures. This interpretation is in agreement with the extracellular vesicular proteomic profile of VLPs (Fig 3). Given the unexpected parallels in their structures and surfacetip localizations, we hypothesized that, like IpaDSipD on the T3SS injectisome, p40 on VLP spikes facilitates invasive contact with the plasma membrane of non-phagocytic lamellocytes to deliver VLP contents. To test this idea, we carried out ab initio modeling of p40. The knowledge-based energetics of the p40 model are similar to crystal structures of similar length (ProSA Z- Score  6.23). 82 of model residues are found in expected local environments (3D Verify). Superimposition of the p40 model against IpaD confirmed the T3SS protein-like fold in p40 (Figs 4 E; S1 C)  30.Heavner et al. Page 5 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptSurprisingly, high-scoring matches to this fold included the vertebrate actin-binding proteins spectrin and plectin (Fig 4 F, superimposed with p40), further strengthening structural parallels between p40 and IpaDSipD. Searches for the most similar structures within the N- terminal half of IpaD family proteins also returned actin-binding proteins (talin, vinculin, - catenin)  31. These proteins are known to reprogram the actin cytoskeleton leading to the profuse membrane ruffling observed in non-phagocytic mammalian cell invasions by Salmonella and Shigella 31. DISCUSSION The composition of Lh VLPs is complex and interesting in multiple respects but the most conspicuous observations are an absence of viral structural proteins and the presence of conserved eukaryotic proteins with microvesicular signature. Abundant Lh-unique proteins, including currently novel proteins, have an unexpected diversity of domains, especially those previously found exclusively in prokaryotic proteins. The mechanisms that contributed to the evolution of VLP proteins (horizontal gene transfer or others  32) remain unknown. Lh VLPs lack the defined symmetry and external coat found in many true viruses including PDVs. Reminiscent of eukaryotic organelles, precursors and mature VLPs exhibit heterogeneity in their shapes, sizes, and spike numbers  9, 33. Moreover, it is noteworthy that, unlike PDVs which are fully formed in the cells of their origin and then released by lysis or budding  14, Leptopilina VLPs assume their final shape outside the cells in which at least some of their proteins and vesicular constituents are synthesized  9, 27. Also, there is currently no evidence for the presence of nucleic acids in VLPs, which further distinguishes them from DNA-containing PDVs. VLPs are unlike endosymbiotic bacteria of Leptopilina wasps  34. Antibiotic-treatment of L. victoriae (sister species of Lh that make VLPs and carry cytoplasmic-incompatibility- inducing Wolbachia ) did not affect genomic amplification of p40 or SmGTPase01 genes. Furthermore, VLP gene loci were amplified not only from female Lh 14 genomes but also male wasp genomes, even though VLPs are not produced in males. BrdU incorporation studies did not support the possibility of DNA-based VLP replication in the venom gland (our unpublished results). The non-replicating nature of the particles, genomic encoding of VLP protein genes, and vesicular signature of their proteome strongly suggest that Lh VLPs are neither viruses nor endosymbiotic bacteria but instead represent a new class of genomically-encoded, microvesicle-like organelles. Extracellular vesicles are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and VLPs carry a diversity of potential immune-suppressive proteins. We, thus, propose the alternative moniker, MSEV (Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles), to replace the VLP term. Virulence factors of parasitic wasps have diversified in response to the variety and complexities of their hosts immune systems. With a broad host range  3, Lh wasps parasitize many Drosophila spp. whose own distinct immune responses are supported by varying numbers and types of blood cells  35. This may explain, first, the diversity of putative virulence and cell death proteins with homologs across the biological kingdoms viral (diedel), bacterial (p40, Syd-like), and eukaryotic (fire ant allergen, B-cell receptor-Heavner et al. Page 6 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptassociated protein 31, etc.), and second, the presence of MSEV paralogs  Lh-specific GTPase and Lh-Lb -common Rho GAP, MEPs, and diedel gene families in the proteome. Multiple members presumably perform redundant or overlapping cell-specific functions for rapid and robust immune suppression, much like the I BCactus-like ankyrin-repeat proteins of distantly-related bracoviral and ichnoviral PDV proteins that block NF- B signaling  36, 37. The parallels between the 3D-structure and locations of p40 with the well-characterized T3SS IpaD-like prokaryotic proteins are provocative and suggest that p40 likely contributes to Lh MSEVs unique blood cell-killing activities. T3SS assemblies are widespread and are used by bacteria to infect plants and animals  26. Pseudomonas aeruginosa use their own T3SS to rapidly infect and kill adult flies. While cytotoxic to macrophages, P. aeruginosa infection activates the NF- B-dependent IMD antimicrobial pathway  38. It is thus possible that elements of the pathogenic bacterial systems have been co-opted by wasps to attack the flys cellular immune system. In this scenario, intracellular protein complexes within lamellocytes would be under direct selective pressure to respond to MSEV-based T3SS-like virulence. The presence of prokaryotic-like (particularly, T3SSflagellar-like) proteins, hints at the possibility that either MSEV spikes evolved from primordial flagellarneedle-like structures or they share evolutionary history with such structures. These findings also support a hypothesis proposed by Martin and colleagues  39 that the eukaryotic endomembrane system may have arisen from bacterial outer membrane vesicles. In this regard, characterization of the prokaryotic protein motifs that comprise nearly 10 of the novel proteins outlined above will be especially revealing. The molecular mechanisms by which MSEV proteins deplete and destroy its well-characterized hosts immune system will suggest how virulence factors are acquired by insect parasites, how these factors evolve, and how insects might serve as reservoirs of disease. Answering these questions is likely to lead to new cost-effective therapies for treating emerging infections and opportunistic diseases. STAR METHODS CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Shubha Govind (sgovindccny.cuny.edu). EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Fly strains All fly stocks were healthy and free of common laboratory infections. Genetically stable stocks with the desired, uniform genotypes were used for infections and crosses were not necessary. The y w strain of D. melanogaster (used as wild type) and Dome-MESO-GFP (gift from M. Crozatier  41) (see Key Resource Table (KRT)) were used. Dome-MESO -GFP is a synthetic construct that replaces lacZ with GFP expression in Pdome-lacZ.MESO (Fly Base FBtp0022619) and produces GFP marked regions of domeless (the fly JAKSTAT receptor) expression  41. Flies were raised on standard fly food cornmeal (65 gL), sucrose (140 gL), agar (10 gL), and yeast (35 gL) with tegosept Heavner et al. Page 7 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptmade in 95 ethanol (22.6 mlL) and propionic acid (5 mlL) (see KRT) medium and maintained long term at 18C with inspection and flipping to new vials every three to four weeks. Prior to experimental work, fly stocks were moved to fresh food, shifted to 25C, and maintained for at least two generations. Adults were used for 2 to 3 rounds of egglays to produce larvae for wasp infections. Mid to late second instar larvae (both male and female) were used for infections and sacrificed during dissection. Leptopilina spp. parasitoid wasp strains All wasp stocks were healthy and free of common laboratory infections. The following wild type parasitoid wasp species and strains were used: Leptopilina heterotoma 14 (Lh 14)  3, L. heterotoma NY ( Lh NY)  9, L. victoriae (Lv) 33, and L. boulardi 17 (Lb 17)  3. (A detailed genotypic notation system has not been formalized for Leptopilina spp. as mutant or transgenic wasps have not been produced to date.) Lh (strains 14 and NY) and L. victoriae are sister species with VLPs that are indistinguishable from each other  9. Wasp stocks were maintained at 18C long-term via infestation of healthy and infection-free mid to late second instar y w D. melanogaster larvae raised on the same fly food medium as the fly-alone cultures (see Fly Strain details, above, for husbandry and housing of flies). Adult wasps were moved to 25C prior to experimental infections. Free-living, adult female wasps were collected with males at approximately one week post eclosion (PE). Mated females were used in experimental infections and were used for infections only once. For VLP purification, female wasps were sorted from males for dissection of venom gland apparatus (males do not possess venom glands). Bacteria E. coli BL21 cells (see KRT for genotype) were used for expression of the p40 central domain (CD). METHOD DETAILS Wasp infections, dissections, and imaging For experimental infections, cultures containing both male and female mid to late second instar D. melanogaster larvae were exposed to 10  12 mated, 1 week PE, Lh 14 or Lb 17 female wasps  3 for 12 hours at 25C. Wasps were removed and larvae were allowed to recover in the medium for 5 hours at 25C. Infected larvae were scooped from the medium, scored for age, matched to y w control wasp-infected larvae, washed in deionized water, washed in phosphate buffered saline (1X PBS, pH 7.2, 25C), and dissected to obtain larval lymph gland tissue. Infection was validated during dissection by the presence of wasp eggs (free floating or attached onto larval gut tissue) and uninfected hosts were discarded. Dissections and slide preparations were performed at 25C. Tissue was dissected on untreated glass slides by bleeding larvae and pulling the cuticle bilaterally below the mouth hooks to leave the mouth parts, lymph gland, and dorsal vessel. After air drying, excess tissue was removed. Samples were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized (1X PBS with 0.3 Triton X-100), and washed again in 1X PBS. Counterstains were applied (Rhodamine-tagged Phalloidin at 0.5 mgml and Hoechst 33258 at 0.02 mgmL) and samples were washed and then mounted in VectaShield.Heavner et al. Page 8 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptSamples were imaged with a Zeiss 510 confocal at 40X. Laser settings were based on GFP negative and uninfected control tissue and all images were scanned using the same instrument settings. Images were processed with Zeiss LSM image browser. Figures were compiled in Adobe Photoshop v12.0.4 and CC 2015.5 and Illustrator CC 2015. Results shown in Fig 1 were validated in dissections of at least twenty animals (n  20 lymph glands) each, infected by either wasp. Results have also been validated by infections and dissection of at least three other D. melanogaster genotypes with replicates of at least five animals (n  5 lymph glands). All infection-related changes to lymph gland morphologies were included in our conclusions (no data were excluded). No strategies for randomization andor stratification, blinding, or sample-size estimation were utilized, or found to be necessary, for this study. VLP purification Three hundred each Lh 14 3 and Lh NY  9 female wasps (see Wasp Strain section, above, for husbandry and housing details) of 1 to 2 weeks PE were sacrificed by submerging in 70 ethanol and rinsed at least three times each in deionized water and 0.1X PBS (pH 7.2) at 4C. Venom gland complexes were dissected in PBS by grasping the ovipositor and gently pulling. Only intact, dissected venom gland complexes with a VLP long gland, reservoir, and ovipositor were used in the purification protocol; other body parts were discarded. Tissue was collected in 1X PBS (4C), gently crushed with a sterile pestle in 200L of 1X PBS (4C), shook vigorously in 300 L 1X PBS (4C), pulse agitated, and added to the top of a 4C Nycodenz gradient. The gradient of 50 to 10 Nycodenz in 1X PBS (5 bands of 900 L, each) was prepared in a clean, RNA-free Beckman 9 cm centrifuge tube and pre-chilled. Whole VLPs were separated from other tissues into a single band by ultracentrifugation (20,000 RPM, 7C, 80 mins). The VLP band was removed from the gradient, washed with 1X PBS (4C), pelleted (11,700 RPM, 7C, 35 mins), resuspended in a minimum of 1X PBS (4C), and stored (4C). Extraction of VLPs from  300 long gland complexes has consistently yielded upwards of thousands of VLPs. Electron microscopy For cryo electron microscopy (EM), purified VLPs were pipetted onto a holey carbon coated grid. Excess fluid was blotted (Whatman 1) and the grid was plunge frozen (liquid ethane) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were visualized with a Technai G2 (200kV) at the New York Structural Biology Center. Membrane surrounding Lh VLPs (observed via cryo EM in Fig 1) was present in all VLPs of more than two sample preparations and this result confirmed previously-published findings from transmission electron microscopy experiments  6, 9. For scanning EM (SEM), purified VLPs (washed and re-suspended, PBS) were fixed in glutaraldehyde (3 in 0.085M sodium cacodylate buffer, overnight, 4C), followed by cacodylate buffer (0.085M, 1 hr, 4C). After washing (glass distilled water) and fixing in osmium tetroxide (1 in 0.085M cacodylate buffer, 1 hr, 4C), VLPs were filtered onto polycarbonate membranes (0.1 m pores). Filtered samples were then dehydrated in serial ethanol washes (technical grade, to 70) and stored overnight. The membranes were washed (amyl acetate), dried, and mounted on pin stubs. Membranes were gold-palladium plated and stored at 60C until imaged on a Ziess Supra 55 SEM. Parameters for SEM imaging of Lh, Lv, and Lb VLPs were consistent for all samples and technical replicates; Heavner et al. Page 9 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptdata presented are representative of many particles from at least two replicates per species VLP. MSMS analysis of Lh VLP proteins Purified VLPs were separated on a 1-D SDS- PAGE gel as per standard protocols. Bands were excised, destained, reduced, alkylated, and trypsin digested. Peptides from combined additional lanes (L457) were also analyzed. Peptides were extracted (Applied Biosystems POROS 20 R2 beads), cleaned-up (C18 ZipTips), dried, and reconstituted in 2 acetonitrile0.1 formic acid. Lh 14 peptides were trapped (Waters Symmetry C 18 trap column (180 m  100 mm, 5 m particles)), washed, and separated on a Waters BEH130 C 18 column (1.7 m particle size) (Waters NanoAcquity UPLC (Milford, MA)). Lh NY peptides were separated on a Waters BEH130 C 18 column (75 m  150 mm). The MS analysis was performed on an LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFisher, CA). The instrument RAW files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 1.4.0.288 with a work template that contained a Target Decoy PSM Validator node (peptide spectrum matches) with both Sequest and Mascot algorithms. Mascot searches, independent of PD, were also conducted. Peptide mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.6 Da. The enzyme was set to trypsin with two maximum missed cleavage sites and the search was against VLPSwiss_20140319.fasta (1332969 entries). Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and oxidation of histidine, methionine and tryptophan were specified as variable modifications. Methylation at aspartic acid residues was specified only for Mascot analyses conducted without PD. The .msf output files were integrated into Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.7.3, Proteome Software Inc.) which was used to validate MSMS based peptide and protein identifications. Identification of Lh VLP proteins VLP proteins (Tables S1, S2) reported here had at least two proteomic peptides, identified at 99 or greater probability by either PD or solo Mascot searches, that aligned to a target sequence. In addition, four proteins are included in the list where only one peptide aligned at 99 more probability (see below, Protein sequence annotations subsection). Full-length target protein sequences were translated from RNA-Seq Lh 14 (GAJC00000000.1) transcripts translated to ORFs  10. The number of aligned peptides varied slightly between PD and Mascot analyses conducted without PD. The PD results have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE  42 partner repository (see KRT for link). In this report, VLP composition is based on the subset of proteins common to both the Lh 14 and NY strains. The common, full-length VLP protein ORFs (Tables S1, S2) were annotated via (A) primary sequence analyses, and (B) structure-based analyses and predictions for select proteins (described below). Note that the Lh 14 dataset is larger and select Lh 14- unique sequences were preferentially included. Additional verification of protein sequences The VLP peptides were also searched against other proteomes (Uniprot D. melanogaster , A. mellifera , H. sapiens , viral, Heavner et al. Page 10 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptprokaryotic and archaea databases  43). The full-length proteins identified from the RNA- Seq ORFs  10 were BLASTed against Lh ESTs (NCBI LIBEST 028179 and 028205,  11, 12), providing an alternative method of ORF sequence verification. This step also identified the full, or near full, length VLP protein clones in our Lh EST collection (e.g., Lh VLP Sm  LgGTPas01). Roughly 20 and  45 of the common VLP proteins were identified in the Heavner et al. 2013  11 and the Colinet et al. 2013  12 studies. (See below, for methods of identification of absencepresence of expression of each Lh VLP protein in Lb 17 and G1 abdominal transcriptomes (Fig 2).) Protein sequence annotations The automated, pipe-line annotation algorithms of (1) BLAST2GO, E  105 (v2.7.0)  44, (2) InterProScan (v5.346)  45, and (3) FastAnnotator  46 were used to characterize all (common set) VLP proteins identified from VLP peptide alignments to Lh transcriptome ORFs (See above). Multiple bioinformatic methods were used to avoid algorithm bias and increase accuracy. Two related criteria were used as measures of reliability of annotations: (a) E values (E  105); and (b) percent identity and percent similarity (applied only when at least 75 of the query aligned to the hit). For manual annotations, BLASTs were conducted via NCBI  47 (nr and TSA databases, default parameters  48). To identify potential Lh VLP protein homologs in microbiota, the unannotated full-length VLP proteins were pBLAST searched against a subset of all nr archaea, viruses, and prokaryotic genomes at higher sensitivity (GenBank, E  10). To identify Lh VLP proteins expressed by Lb 17 and G1, all VLP sequences were tBLASTn searched with default parameters against GAJA00000000.1 (Lb 17) and GAIW00000000.1 transcriptomes ( Ganaspis sp1 (G1)) 10. The Conserved Domains Database (CDD)  49, 50 and PFAM  51 were used for domain identifications and architectures. Manual annotation results are reported in main text only if they were confirmed by a second method. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) numbers were assigned using GhostKOALA  52. KO numbers were then used to obtain model ortholog annotations. For pairwise and multiple-sequence alignments, T-Coffee  53, Needleman  54, ClustalOmega  55, and MUSCLE  56, 57 (EBI webserver, default parameters) were used and ESPript 3.0  58 was used for visualizations. FunRich  59 was used for functional enrichment and over-representation analyses against two extracellular vesicle databases, Exocarta  60, 61 and Vesiclepedia  62. Circos (v0.69) was used to visualize the proteome 63. The four proteins with only on a single aligned peptide (99 or greater peptide probability) (Fig 3; Tables S1, S2) passed the (1) manual inspections of their MSMS spectra and fragments, (2) solo Mascot searches, and (3) ExocartaVesiclepedia enrichment analyses. Of these four proteins, one is classified as novel (Class 3; Figs 2, 3 A), while the other three have sequence similarities with eukaryotic proteins (Class 1; Fig 2, 3) of extracellular vesicles (Fig 3 B, C).Heavner et al. Page 11 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIn silico structural predictions of SmGTPase01 A high-quality structural model was created for SmGTPase01 using a hybrid approach. A MODELLER  64 model was created using three templates: GIMAP crystal structure 3V70 and two ab initio models  65. 3V70 was chosen using threading metaservers (LOMETS  66 and PHYRE2  67) and was evaluated in single-template MODELLER trials. Loop modeling and side-chain optimization were done using Loopy  68 and SCWRL4  69, respectively. The active site of this full- length model is presented in Fig 4 C; the remaining details of the model will be published elsewhere. The SmGTPase01 co-factor, Mg2, was placed in the active site based on COFACTOR  70 and was checked for positioning using WHAT IF  71. GTP was placed and checked for energy minimization in the SmGTPase01 active site with Autodock Vina  72. The cofactor and substrate placements were confirmed with predictions from COACH  73, BSP-SLIM 74, and 3D Ligand  75. The qualities and knowledge-based energy values of our models were assessed using ProSA- web  76 and Verify3D  77. TM-Align was used to compare crystal structures and our in silico models  30. STRIDE  78 was used to define secondary structures from molecular coordinates. Crystal structure molecular files came from the Protein Data Bank ( http: www.rcsb.orgpdbhomehome.do ). Cloning and structural predictions of p40 For p40-specific proteomics, peptides isolated and digested from an anti-p40 positive SDS-PAGE gel band were sequenced at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility by HPLC-MSMS (Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap) and then BLAST queried against NCBI GAJC00000000.1 RNA-Seq Lh 14 database. For p40 cloning and expression, the p40 IpaD-like central domain (CD) was amplified from venom gland cDNA and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. Primer sequences are listed in Key Resource Table. The p40 central domain (amino acids 26  240, Fig 4 D) was expressed from a pTrcHisA subclone by addition of IPTG (1 mM, ThermoFisher Scientific). E. coli BL21cells were lysed by freeze-thaw in lysis buffer (10 triton X, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8) with protease inhibitors (AEBSF-HCl 100 mM, aprotinin 80 M, bestatin 5 mM, E-64 1.5 mM, leupeptin 2 mM, pepstatin A 1 mM, Sigma or Fermentas). Protein concentrations in all assays were determined with Bradford reagent 79. For the verification of p40 identity via western analyses, bacterial proteins were separated (SDS-PAGE, 5 stacking and 12 resolving), transferred to membrane (nitrocellulose, HyBond, Amersham Life Science), and blocked (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1  Tween 20, 5 nonfat dry milk, 3 bovine serum albumin (1 hr, 25C)). Primary antibodies used were anti-p40 (1:1000) or anti-6X-His (1:1000; 12 hr, 4C). Alkaline-phosphatase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2,500; 1 hour, 25C), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3 -indolyphosphate (BCIP, Amresco), and nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT, Biotium) solutions in NaCl-Tris-MgCl 2 buffer (NTM, pH 9.5) were used for detection.Heavner et al. Page 12 Curr Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 September 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptFor p40 structural predictions, ab initio and template fragment assembly methods  80 65 were used along with N-terminal predictions from MODELLERs loop methods  8183. Structural optimizations were generated using ModRefiner  84. The most N- and C- terminal residues of p40 are predicted to be a signal peptide and transmembrane helix and were not modeled (Fig S1 C). Crystal structures ( http:www.rcsb.orgpdbhomehome.do ) similar to our in silico p40 model were identified using DaliLITE  85. Antibiotic treatment of LvTo cure Lv adults of the strain of Gram negative Wolbachia endosymbionts  34, three successive generations of Lv females were cultivated from infections of y w D. melanogaster egglays on fly food medium containing rifampicin at 0.75 mgg (see Fly and Wasp Strain sections, above, for husbandry and housing details). The next six generations of Lv wasps were cultivated on larvae raised on standard, antibiotic-free medium, to assure no direct drug effects. Isogenized control wasps did not receive antibiotic treatment and were otherwise reared the same way as experimental wasps. For PCR amplification of wasp genomic DNA, antibiotic-treated and control male and female wasps, no more than 1 week PE, were sorted into microfuge tubes and frozen at 20C. Genomic DNA template was amplified for the absence or presence of (a) Lv-specific gatB and coxA genes of Wolbachia , and (b) VLP protein genes (p40 and SmLgGTPase01) (see Analyses of genomic sequences, below, and KRT). Results from all PCR amplification experiments supported the conclusions in this study. Analyses of genomic sequences Total genomic DNA from Lh, antibiotic-treated Lv, and control wasps was obtained using a Qiagen DNA Blood and Tissue kit. Primer sequences are listed in KRT; the following notation is used: y  pyrimidines; r  purines; and k  T and G. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Details regarding experimental replicates are provided with each Method. As indicated in the Wasp infections, dissections, and imaging subsection, n in this study refers to the whole lymph gland of an animal (i.e., two lobes). More than 35 lymph glands from larvae of different genotypes yielded consistent results after wasp infection. Similarly, examination of numerous VLPs in each sample, as well as repetition of different EM protocols provided supporting information regarding VLP morphologies. Confidence in proteomics results is based on peptide characterizations of purified VLP preparations from two independent strains of Lh. The criteria of agreement between multiple, independent methods for identification and annotation of VLP proteins (both novel and previously characterized) were met. Confidence in quantitative bioinformatics results (e.g., E values for BLAST results and domain predictions, RMSDs for protein model analyses, p-values for enrichments) is based on the algorithms intrinsic to these methods and is described in the corresponding primary references. Where possible, more than one computational approach (supported by different algorithms and metaservers) was used to strengthen interpretation by avoiding biases arising from a single computational methodology. No additional statistical analyses or methods to determine assumption credibility andor sample size were conducted for this study.Heavner et al. Page 13 Curr Biol .
