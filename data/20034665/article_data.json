Keywords Cartilage repair; stem cell; bioreactor; biomechanics; growth factors INTRODUCTION Degenerative joint disease affects twenty million adults with an economic burden of over 40 billion per year in the US1. Once damaged, adult human articular cartilage has a limited capacity for intrinsic repair2 and hence injuries can lead to progressive damage, joint degeneration, pain, and disability. Cell-based repair of small cartilage defects in the knee joint was first demonstrated clinically fifteen years ago 3. Many cartilage tissue engineering studies use chondrocytes as the cell source 4,5, however this approach is challenged by limited supply of chondrocytes, their limited regenerative potential due to age, disease, de-differentiation during in vitro expansion, and the morbidity caused by chondrocyte harvest6. Therefore, other studies use mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as the cell source7,8, as these stem cells can be safely harvested by marrow biopsy, readily expanded in vitro , and selectively differentiated into chondrocytes9. Clinical translation of tissue engineered cartilage is currently limited by inadequate construct structure, mechanical function, and integration2,10 Currently, most tissue engineered constructs for articular cartilage repair possess cartilage-mimetic material properties only after long-term ( e.g., 1 to 6 month) in vitro culture 5,11,12 . This lack of early construct mechanical function implies a need for new tissue engineering technologies such as scaffolds and bioreactors13,14. For example, the stiffness and strength of previously used scaffolds were several orders of magnitude below normal articular cartilage, particularly in tension12,15, 16. Likewise, mechanical properties of engineered cartilage produced using these scaffolds and hMSC were at least one order of magnitude below values reported for normal cartilage despite prolonged in vitro culture17,18. The goal of the present study was to produce mechanically functional tissue engineered cartilage from adult hMSC and three-dimensionally (3D) woven PCL scaffolds in 21 days in vitro . Effects of (i) scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven PCL), (ii) culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor) and (iii) medium composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum) on construct mechanical, biochemical, and molecular properties were quantified. A 3D weaving method19 was applied to multi-filament PCL yarn to createValonen et al. Page 2 Biomaterials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptscaffolds with cartilage-mimetic mechanical properties. The PCL was selected because it is a FDA-approved, biocompatible material 20,21  that supports chondrogenesis 22 and degrades slowly ( i.e. less than 5 degradation at 2 years, as measured by mass loss) into by-products that are entirely cleared from the body23,24. The 3D woven PCL scaffolds were seeded with hMSC mixed with Matrigel such that gel entrapment enhanced cell seeding efficiency25 and also helped maintain spherical cell morphology for promotion of chondrogenesis26. The hMSC-PCL constructs were cultured either in static dishes or in an oscillatory bioreactor that provided bi-directional percolation of culture medium directly through the construct27. Bioreactors were studied because these devices are known to enable functional tissue engineering due to combined effects of enhanced mass transport and mechanotransduction 14,2834 . Bi-directional rather than uni-directional perfusion was selected because the latter yielded different conditions at opposing construct upper and lower surfaces resulting in spatial concentration gradients and inhomogeneous tissue development35,36. Three different culture media were tested as follows. Differentiation medium 1 (DM1) containing serum and chondrogenic additives (TGF- , ITS Premix, dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, proline, and non-essential amino acids) was selected based on our previous work8,17, 37. Differentiation medium 2 (DM2) containing chondrogenic additives but not serum was selected based on reports that serum inhibited chondrogenesis by synoviocytes38,39 and caused hypertrophy of chondrocytes40. Control medium (CM) without chondrogenic additives was tested to assess spontaneous chondrogenic differentiation in hMSC-PCL constructs. MATERIALS AND METHODS All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise specified. Poly(-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds A custom-built loom19 was used to weave PCL multi-filament yarns (24 m diameter per filament; 44 filamentsyarn, Grilon KE-60, EMSGriltech, Domat, Switzerland) in three orthogonal directions (x-warp, y-weft, and a vertical z-direction) (Figure 1A). A loosely woven scaffold was made with widely spaced warp yarns (8 yarnscm), closely spaced weft yarns (20 yarnscm) and two z-layers between each warp yarn (Figure 1B). A tightly woven scaffold was made with closely spaced warp and weft yarns (24 and 20 yarnscm, respectively) and one z- layer between each warp yarn. (Figure 1C). These weaving parameters, in conjunction with fiber size and the density of PCL (1.145 gcm3)41, determined scaffold porosity and pore dimensions. The loosely woven scaffold had porosity of 68  0.3, approximate pore dimensions of 850 m 1100 m  100 m, and approximate thickness of 0.9 mm. The tightly woven scaffold had porosity of 61  0.2 , approximate pore dimensions of 330 m  260 m  100 m and approximate thickness of 1.3 mm. Prior to cell culture, scaffolds were immersed in 4N NaOH for 18 h, thoroughly rinsed in de-ionized water, dried, ethylene oxide sterilized, and punched into 7 mm diameter discs using dermal punches (Acuderm Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL). Human mesenchymal stem cells The hMSCs were derived from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy middle-aged adult male at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University. Informed consent was obtained, and an Institutional Review Board-approved aspiration procedure was used42. Briefly, the bone marrow sample was washed with Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM-LG, Gibco) supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serumValonen et al. Page 3 Biomaterials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript(FBS) from a selected lot9. The sample was centrifuged at 460 g on a pre-formed Percoll density gradient (1.073 gmL) to isolate the mononucleated cells. These cells were resuspended in serum-supplemented medium and seeded at a density of 1.8105 cellscm2 in 10 cm diameter plates. Non-adherent cells were removed after four days by changing the medium. For the remainder of the cell expansion phase, the medium was additionally supplemented with 10 ng mL of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-basic (rhFGF-2, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ)43, and was replaced twice per week. The primary culture was trypsinized after approximately two weeks, and then cryopreserved using Gibco Freezing medium. Tissue engineered constructs The hMSC were thawed and expanded by approximately 10-fold during a single passage in which cells were plated at 5,500 cellscm2 and cultured in DMEM-LG supplemented with 10 FBS, 10 ngmL of rhFGF-2, and 1 penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone. Medium was completely replaced every 23 days for 7 days. Multi-potentiality was verified for the expanded hMSC by inducing differentiation into the chondrogenic lineage in pellet cultures of passage 2 (P2) cells44, and into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages in monolayer culture45. The PCL scaffolds (a total of n 1520 per group, in three independent studies) were seeded with P2 hMSC by mixing cells in growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) while working at 4C, and pipetting the cell-gel mixture evenly onto both surfaces of the PCL scaffold. Each 7 mm diameter, 0.9 mm thick loosely woven scaffold was seeded with a cell pellet (1 million cells in 10 uL) mixed with 25 L of Matrigel, whereas each 7 mm diameter, 1.3 mm thick tightly woven scaffold was seeded with a similar cell pellet mixed with 35 L of Matrigel. Freshly seeded constructs were placed in 24-well plates (one construct per well), placed in a 37C in a humidified, 5 CO 2room air incubator for 30 min to allow Matrigel gelation, and then 1 mL of medium was added to each well. After 24 h, constructs were transferred either into 6-well plates (one construct per well containing 9 mL of medium) and cultured statically, or into bioreactor chambers as previously described27 . Briefly, each construct allocated to the bioreactor group was placed in a custom- built poly(dimethyl-siloxane) (PDMS) chamber that was connected to a loop of gas-permeable silicone rubber tubing (132 inch wall thickness, Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). Each loop was then mounted on a supporting disc, and medium (9 mL) was added, such that the construct was submerged in medium in the lower portion of the loop and a gas bubble was present in the upper portion of the loop27. Multiple loops were mounted on an incubator-compatible base that slowly oscillated the chamber about an arc of 160. Importantly, bioreactor oscillation directly applied bi-directional medium percolation and mechanical stimulation to their upper and lower surfaces of the discoid constructs. Three different medium compositions (DM1, DM2 and CM) were studied. Differentiation medium 1 (DM1) was DMEM-HG supplemented with 10 FBS, 10 ngmL hTGF -3 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 1 ITS Premix (BD Biosciences), 107 M dexamethasone (Sigma), 50 mgL ascorbic acid, 0.4 mM proline, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, 100 UmL penicillin, 100 UmL streptomycin, and 0.25 gmL of fungizone. Differentiation medium 2 (DM2) was identical to DM1 except without FBS. Control medium (CM) was identical to DM1 except without chondrogenic additives (TGF -3, ITS Premix, and dexamethasone). Media were replaced at a rate of 50 every 34 days, and constructs were harvested after 1, 7, 14, and 21 days. Mechanical testing Confined compression tests 46 were performed on 3 mm diameter cylindrical test specimens cored from the centers of 21-day constructs or acellular (initial) scaffolds using an ELF-3200 materials testing system (Bose-Enduratec, Framingham, MA). Specimens (n  56 per group)Valonen et al. Page 4 Biomaterials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptplaced in a 3 mm diameter confining chamber within a bath of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and compressive loads were applied using a solid piston against a rigid porous platen (porosity of 50, pore size of 50100 m). Following equilibration of a 10 gf tare load, a step compressive load of 30 gf was applied to the sample and allowed to equilibrate for 2000s. Aggregate modulus (H A) and hydraulic permeability (k) were determined numerically by matching the solution for axial strain ( z) to the experimental data for all creep tests using a two-parameter, nonlinear least-squares regression procedure 47,48 . Unconfined compression tests were done by applying strains, , of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16 to the specimens (n  56 per group) in a PBS bath after equilibration of a 2 tare strain. Strain steps were held constant for 900s which allowed the specimens to relax to an equilibrium level. Youngs modulus was determined by linear regression on the resulting equilibrium stress-strain plot. Histology and immunohistochemistry Histological analyses were performed after specimens (n  2 constructs per time point per group) were fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for 24 h at 4C, post fixed in 70 ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned both en-face and in cross-section. Sections 5 m thick were stained with safranin-Ofast green for proteoglycans. For immunohistochemical analysis, 20 m thick sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. To efficiently expose epitopes, the sections were incubated with 700 UmL bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) and 2 UmL pronase XIV (Sigma) for 1 h at 37C. Double immunostaining for collagen type I (mouse monoclonal antibody, ab6308; Abcam Inc. Cambridge, MA) and collagen type II (mouse monoclonal anitibody, CIICI; Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) was performed using an AvidinBiotin kit (Vector lab, Burlingame, CA). Control sections were incubated with PBS1 bovine serum albumin (Sigma) without primary antibody. Biochemical analyses Standard assays for DNA, ortho-hydroxyproline (OHP, an index of total collagen content), and GAG (an index of proteoglycan content) were performed (n  34 bisected constructs per time point per group). Values obtained for all 1-day constructs produced from tightly woven PCL scaffolds in DM1, DM2, and CM groups were pooled, averaged, and used as a basis for comparison for subsequent (7, 14, and 21-day) constructs produced from tightly woven scaffolds. After measuring wet weight, constructs were diced and digested in papain for 12 h at 60C. DNA was measured using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). GAG was measured using the Blyscan sulphated GAG assay (Biocolor, Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland). To measure total collagen, papain digests were hydrolyzed in HCl at 110C overnight, dried in a desiccating chamber, reconstituted in acetate- citrate buffer, filtered through activated charcoal, and OHP was quantified by Ehrlichs reaction 49. Briefly, hydrolysates were oxidized with chloramine-T, treated with dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, read at 540 nm against a trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline standard curve, and total collagen was calculated by using a ratio of 10 g of collagen per 1 g of 4- hydroxyproline. The conversion factor of 10 was selected since immunohistochemical staining showed that type II collagen represented virtually all of the collagen present in the constructs 50,51. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) The presence of two cartilage biomarkers were tested: Sox-9, one of the earliest markers for MSC differentiation towards the chondrocytic lineage, preceding the activation of collagen II 52, and collagen type II, a chondrocyte related gene. Collagen type I provided a marker for undifferentiated MSCs, and GAPDH provided an intrinsic control 53. Total RNA was isolated from hMSCs prior to and after culture on PCL scaffolds (n  34 bisected constructs per group per time point) using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. DNase treated RNA was used to make firstValonen et al. Page 5 Biomaterials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 March 1.

The cDNA was amplified in a iCycler Thermal Cycler 582BR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using primer sequences given in Table 1. The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94C; 30 cycles of (30 s at 94C, 45s at 58C, 1min at 72C), and 5 min at 72C. The PCR products were analyzed by means of 2 agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium bromide (E-Gel 2, Invitrogen). Statistical analysis Data were calculated as mean  standard error and analyzed using multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with Tukeys post hoc test using Statistica (v. 7, Tulsa, OK, USA). Values of p 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS Effects of scaffold structure Scaffold structure did not have any significant effect on the amounts of DNA, total collagen, or GAG in constructs cultured statically for 21 days in DM1 (Table 2, Group A vs. B). In contrast, scaffold structure significantly impacted aggregate modulus (H A) and Youngs modulus (E) of initial (acellular) scaffolds and cultured constructs (Figure 2). Acellular loosely woven scaffolds exhibited lower (p0.05) mechanical properties (H A of 0.18  0.011 MPa and E of 0.042  0.004 MPa) than acellular tightly woven scaffolds (H A of 0.46  0.049 MPa and E of 0.27  0.017 MPa). Likewise, 21-day constructs based on loosely woven scaffolds exhibited lower (p0.05) mechanical properties (H A of 0.16  0.006 MPa and E of 0.064  0.004 MPa) than constructs based on tightly woven scaffolds (H A of 0.37  0.030 MPa and E of 0.41  0.023 MPa) (Figure 2). As compared to acellular scaffolds, the 21-day constructs exhibited similar aggregate modulus and higher ( p0.05) Youngs modulus. Effects of culture vessel Aggregate modulus of 21-day constructs based on tightly woven PCL and cultured in bioreactors was higher ( p0.05 ) than that measured for otherwise similar constructs cultured statically (Figure 2, Table 2). Construct amounts of DNA, total collagen, and GAG increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel and medium composition. DNA and GAG contents were similar in 21-day constructs cultured in bioreactors and statically (Figures 3A and 3C). Total collagen content was 1.5-fold higher ( p  0.05) in bioreactor compared to static cultures (Figure 3B; Table 2, Group B vs. C). Bioreactors yielded more homogeneous tissue development than static cultures based on qualitative histological appearance of cross-sections (Figure 4, row I). Chondrogenesis was demonstrated histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline-like matrix that immunostained strongly and homogeneously positive for collagen type II. Bioreactors yielded constructs in which Coll-II immunostaining was more pronounced than static cultures (Figure 4, row IV). Immunostaining for Col-I was minimal under all conditions tested. The RT-PCR analysis showed type of culture vessel did not affect the temporal expression of mRNAs for collagen type II (Figure 5A), Sox-9 (Figure 5B), collagen type I (not shown) and GAPDH (not shown). Effects of medium composition DNA content was 1.4-fold higher (p0.05) in 21-day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3A, Table 2, Group B vs. D). Also, total collagen content was 1.8-fold higher (p0.05 ) in 21-day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3B). Conversely, GAG content was lower (42 as high, p0.05 ) in 21-day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3C). Likewise, the GAGDNA ratio was lower (30 as high, p0.05 ) in 21- day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Table 2). Culture in DM2 yielded moreValonen et al. Page 6 Biomaterials .

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptchondrogenic differentiation of hMSC than DM1, based on histological appearance of cells and ECM (more rounded chondrocytes; more homogeneously positive matrix staining for GAG and Coll-II, Figure 4, rows III and IV). Culture in DM2 yielded earlier expression of collagen type II mRNA (Figure 5A) such that this biomarker was present by day 7 in contrast to DM1. Constructs cultured in CM contained substantially lower amounts collagen and GAG compared to DM1 (Table 2, Group B vs. E). Chondrogenic differentiation was virtually absent in constructs cultured in CM with respect to rounded cell shape, matrix staining for GAG and collagen type II, and measured GAG and collagen contents (Figure 3 and Figure 4). DISCUSSION The findings of this study demonstrate the ability to produce functional tissue engineered cartilage starting from hMSC and a tightly woven PCL scaffold within 21 days in vitro . Importantly, aggregate and Youngs moduli of hMSC-PCL constructs cultured statically and in bioreactors (Table 2, Groups B and C), approached the values reported for normal articular cartilage (H A of 0.1 to 2.0 MPa; E of 0.4 to 0.8 MPa)5456. Youngs modulus was higher for 21-day constructs than initial acellular scaffolds, which may be due to accumulation of cell- derived cartilaginous extracellular matrix within the 3D woven scaffold and associated increase in shear modulus. These effects would be expected to reduce relative PCL yarn movement and cross-sectional shape distortion during compressive testing and have a more pronounced effect during mechanical testing in the unconfined configuration ( i.e., where scaffolds are not laterally constrained) than the confined configuration, thereby affecting E more than H A. Although short term maintenance of mechanical properties of constructs and scaffolds was demonstrated, further studies of constructs and acellular scaffolds are warranted to assess mechanical properties over longer time periods. Long-term maintenance can be reasonably expected due to the slow biodegradation of PCL23,24 in concert with continued accumulation of cell- derived cartilaginous matrix. Efficient hMSC seeding and cartilaginous matrix deposition were observed for loosely and tightly woven PCL scaffolds, and can be attributed to the combination of Matrigel-enhanced cell entrapment25 and large, homogenously distributed pores in the scaffold ( i.e. in-plane pores of 250 to 1000 m, Figure 1). Consistently, scaffolds with 250 to 500m pores were found to enhance GAG secretion as compared to smaller pores57, and 380 to 405 m pores were found suitable for chondrocyte proliferation58. Culture in an oscillating bioreactor yielded constructs with higher aggregate modulus, higher total collagen content, and more homogeneous tissue development, especially at the upper and lower surfaces than otherwise identical static cultures (Figure 2Figure 4). Constructs from the oscillating bioreactor exhibited strongly positive immunostaining for Coll-II and virtually negative staining for Coll- I, although collagen type II as a fraction of the total collagen was not explicitly measured. We previously showed that constructs from rotating bioreactors contained more total and type II collagen than statically cultured controls 12, and in these constructs Coll-II represented 92 to 99  of the total collagen 51,59 . Consistently, others showed hydrodynamic shear increased total collagen, type II collagen, and tensile modulus of multi-layered chondrocyte sheets60, and bi-directional perfusion yielded more homogeneous tissue engineered cartilage than uni- directional perfusion35,36. Culture medium composition significantly impacted construct amounts of DNA and GAG, intensity of safranin-O staining and Coll-II immunostaining, and the temporal profile of chondrogenic differentiation by hMSC. Specifically, chondrogenic additives without serum (DM2) yielded constructs with higher GAG, higher GAGDNA ratio, earlier expression of collagen II mRNA, and more homogenous immunostaining for Coll-II as compared to chondrogenic additives with serum (DM1) (Figure 3Figure 5). Consistently, serum was recently reported to inhibit chondrogenic differentiation of synoviocytes38,39, and thisValonen et al. Page 7 Biomaterials . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptfinding was attributed to an enhanced proliferation of the cells that hindered their differentiation capacity. Interestingly, the GAGDNA ratio measured in the present study at culture day 21 exceeded the GAGDNA ratios previously reported after prolonged in vitro cultivation17, 39,61. CONCLUSION In this work, a 3D-woven PCL scaffold combined with adult human stem cells yielded mechanically functional tissue engineered cartilage constructs within only 21 days in vitro . Scaffold structure significantly impacted construct aggregate and Youngs moduli ( i.e., tightly woven scaffolds yielded constructs with higher moduli than more loosely woven scaffolds). Importantly, compressive moduli of 21-day constructs based on tightly woven scaffolds approached values reported for normal articular cartilage. Production of constructs with robust mechanical properties was accelerated by culture in oscillating bioreactors as compared to static dishes ( i.e., the bioreactor yielded constructs with higher H A, higher total collagen content, more immunostaining for collagen type II, and more spatially homogenous tissue development). Chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC was observed only if culture medium was supplemented with chondrogenic additives (TGF , ITS Premix), and was accelerated if this medium did not contain serum ( i.e., lack of serum yielded constructs with higher GAG content, higher GAGDNA ratio, earlier expression of collagen type II mRNA, and more pronounced matrix staining for GAG and collagen type II).
