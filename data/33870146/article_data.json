Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceight-associated experi-ments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and genequantication steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressedgenes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data sub-mitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database.We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipelinein order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceight-relevant da- tasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with thedata available in GeneLab. INTRODUCTION Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition,spaceight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceight fac-tors andor confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO 2concentration, light cycle, and water availability, a ll of which can have effects on an organisms health and gene expression proles during spaceight ( Rutter et al., 2020 ). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool se- lection on results is an active eld of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters ( Williams et al., 2016 ), read aligner ( Yang et al., 2015 ), quantication tool ( Teng et al., 2016 ), and differential expression detection algorithm ( Costa-Silva et al. 2017 ) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardize d analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets ( ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020 ;Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012 ).1Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA 2Logyx, LLC, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA 3Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA 4Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA 5The Bionetics Corporation, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA 6Institute for Global Food Security (IGFS)  School ofBiological Sciences, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK 7Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA 8MRC Versus Arthritis Centre for Musculoskeletal AgeingResearch, Royal Derby Hospital, University of Nottingham  National Institute for Health Research Nottingham BiomedicalResearch Centre, Derby DE22 3DT, UK 9Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, Department of Biomedical Engineering, RensselaerPolytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180, USA 10Departments of Pathology, and of Biomedical Data Continued iScience 24, 102361, April 23, 2021 This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http:creativecommons.orglicensesby4.0 ).1ll OPEN ACCESSThe NASA GeneLab database ( https:genelab-data.ndc.nasa.govgenelabprojects )w a sc r e a t e da sa central repository for spaceight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experimentsthat prole transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceight condition s. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty data- sets with RNA-se quencing data ( Table S1 ). These datasets include Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit y), Arabidopsis thaliana (model higher plant), Oryzias latipes (Japanese rice sh), Helix lucorum (land snail), Brassica rapa (Fast Plant), Eruca vesicaria (arugulaedible plant), Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid), Ceratopteris richardii (aquatic fern), and the bacte- rium, Bacillus subtilis from experiments performed during true spaceight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceight-analog studies,such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies ( Berrios et al., 2020 ). NASAs GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40 years of archivedNASA Life Sciences data ( Scott et al., 2020 ). One of the rst steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets i mpact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data a re harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientic community and held its rst Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most com-mon types of spaceight datasets: transcription proling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic s oftware tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools. The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step ofthe consensus pipeline so users can download and use these intermediate data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceight environment,independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and pro- cessed datasets to the public allows biologists and ot hers to more easily interpret these data and contrib- utes signicantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceight on terrestrial organisms. Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computationannotation ( Figure 1 A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) ( Andrews, 2010 ;Ewels et al., 2016 ), read trimming (TrimGalore) ( Krueger 2019 ), mapping (STAR) ( Dobin et al., 2013 ), quantication (RSEM) ( Li and Dewey 2011 ), and differential gene expression calculationannotation (DESeq2) ( Love et al. 2014 )(Figure 1 B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and les produced by the RCP for each RNA- seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download. RESULTS Data pre-processing: quality control and trimming There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the rst of which is data preprocessing ( Figure 2 A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ les from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software ( Andrews, 2010 )(Figure 2 B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality,including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequencecontent, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distribu- tions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content. The FastQC program is run on each individual sample  le. However, reviewing the FastQC results for each sample le can be tedious and time consuming. Experiments typically have many sample les (biologicalScience, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA 11Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, WA99164, USA 12Center for Computational Biology  Bioinformatics, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093,USA 13Phylos Bioscience, Portland, OR 97214, USA 14NASA Postdoctoral Program, Universities SpaceResearch Association, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA 15Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA 16Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas Margarita Salas (CSIC), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain 17Center for Pediatric Bone Biology and TranslationalResearch, Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, 2222 Welborn St., Dallas, TX 75219, USA 18Los Alamos National Laboratory, BioscienceDivision, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA 19Exobiology Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA 94035, USA 20Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, Seattle, WA 98154, USA 21Department of Medicine, University of California SanDiego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA 22Department of Radiation Medicine, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA 23Department of Neurobiology and Pharmacology, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30310, USA 24Department of Genetics, Stanford University School ofMedicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA 25Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA 26NGM Biopharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA 27National Jewish Health, Center for Genes,Environment, and Health,ll OPEN ACCESS 2 iScience 24, 102361, April 23, 2021iScienc e Articleandor technical replicates) for multiple experimental conditions (spaceight, ground control, etc.). For this reason, we also use the MultiQC package ( Ewels et al., 2016 )(Figure 2 C) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from FastQC across all experiment samples. After performing quality control on the raw FASTQ data, reads are trimmed using TrimGalore ( Krueger 2019 ) to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step ( Figure 2 D). TrimGalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt pro- gram ( Martin 2011 ) for read trimming. TrimGalore was selected for the RCP due to its simplied command line interface, thorough output of trimming metrics, and ability to automatically detect adapters.

After trimming, the quality control programs, FastQCand MultiQC, are again run on the trimmed FASTQ les for viewing the quality control metrics of the reads that will be used for data processing. Once the data have been preprocessed, the sequenced reads are ready for mapping and quantication. Data processing: read mapping and sample quantication In the data processing step ( Figure 1 ; Step 2A), the trimmed reads are rst aligned to the reference genome (Figure 3 A) with STAR, a splice-aware aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 ).

Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.ll OPEN ACCESS 4 iScience 24, 102361, April 23, 2021iScienc e Articlestep is to create indexed genome les ( Figure 3 B). These les are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome le. This step requires reference FASTA andGTF les ( Table S2 ). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in con- trola pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 2 20concentration range (Jiang et al., 2011 ). If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF les are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF les, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed refer- ence genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome ( Figure 3 C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally beA B C Figure 3. Data processing (pip eline step 2A): read mapping (A) Data processing pipeline. Trimmed reads are mapped to their reference genome and transcriptome with STAR.

STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a sep arate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantication of splice sites, STAR is run in two-pass mode. Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynam-ically generated reference to improve the quantication of splice isoforms ( Dobin et al., 2013 ). Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out les) for further analysis of differential splicing. The second part of processing is quantifying the number of reads mapped to each annotated transcript and gene ( Figure 1 A; Step 2B, Figure 4 A). For this task, the RCP uses RSEM ( Li and Dewey 2011 ). The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distin-guish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will mapto multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases ( Figure 4 A). The rst phase uses the reference genome and GTF les (with or without ERCC as appropriate) ( Table S2 ) to prepare indexed genome les ( Figure 4 B). The second phase uses the indexed les and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene ( Figure 4 C). There are two output les generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differentialgene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression b u ta r en o tu s e dd u r i n gd i f f e r e n t i a lg e n ee x p r e s s i o nc a l c u l a t i o ni nt h eR C P .O n c et h eR S E Mc o u n t l e sa r e generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes.

Thus, we wouldhave been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG. We elected to adopt a mapping-based approach rather than rapidly quantifying the reads via a k-mer- based counting algorithm, pseudo-aligners, or a quasi-mapping method that utilizes RNA-seq inference procedures such as Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 )o rS a l m o n( Patro et al., 2017 ) despite their speed advantages. This is because alignment-free quantication tools do not accurately quantify low-abundant and smallRNAs especially when biolog ical variation is present ( Wu et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, alignment of reads al- lows for additional analyses beyond transcript and gene quantication such as measurement of gene body coverage and detection of novel transcripts. There are several alignment-based mapping tools ava ilable and each has advantages and disadvantages. An alignment tool that is sensitive to splice-isoforms is critical to accurately identify how expression of splice-isoforms is affected by the spaceight environment. DNA-specic aligners such as BWA ( Li and Dur- bin 2009 ) and Bowtie ( Langmead et al., 2009 ) cannot handle intron-sized gaps and thus an RNA-seq-spe- cic aligner is needed ( Baruzzo et al., 2017 ). In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specic data, applicability to a va riety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efcient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments. Severalstudies have been conducted to compare the wide variety of available RNA-seq specic alignment tools, and of these, the STAR aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indi- cated criteria ( Baruzzo et al., 2017 ;Schaarschmidt et al., 2020 ;Raplee et al. 2019 ). Differential gene expression calculations and addition of gene annotations Once reads have been mapped and quan tied, differential expression analysis is performed using the DESeq2 R package ( Figure 1 ;S t e p3 , Figure 5 A). Unlike the previous steps, a custom R script (GeneLab_DG- E_wERCC.R or GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R) ( Data S1 and S2) is used to run DESeq2; to create both unnor- malized and normalized counts tables; and to generate a differential gene expression (DGE) output table containing normalized counts for each sample, DGE results, and gene annotations ( Figure 5 B). The Gen- eLab DGE R script also creates computer-readable tab les that are used by the GeneLab visualization portal to generate various plots so users can easily view and b egin interpreting the processed data. These scriptsll OPEN ACCESS 6 iScience 24, 102361, April 23, 2021iScienc e Articleare provided in the NASA GeneLab_Da ta_Processing Github repository ( https:github.comnasa GeneLab_Data_Processing ). In the following sections we descri be each step of these scripts in order. The GeneLab DGE R script requires three inputs: the quantied count data from the previous (RSEM) step; sample metadata from the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) tables in the ISA.zip le (provided in theGeneLab repository with each dataset) ( Sansone et al., 2012 ;Rocca-Serra et al., 2010 ); and the organ- isms.csv le ( Table S3 ) ,w h i c hi su s e dt os p e c i f yt h eo r g a n i s mu s e di nt h es t u d ya n dr e l e v a n tg e n eRSEM Prepare Reference Parameters rsem-prepare-reference --gtf pathtoannotationgtffile  pathtogenomefastafile  pathtoRSEMgenomedirectoryRSEM_ref_prefix Input data files .fasta (genome sequence) .gtf (genome annotation) Note that for analyzing samples with ERCC spike-in, the genome FASTA and GTF files should have the ERCC FASTA and GTF files appended to them.

Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1 ) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2 ). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must bedened. Each script starts by dening the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv le so that it matches the abbreviations used i n the PANTHER database ( Mi et al. 2013 ;Thomas 2003 ) for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip le are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata for matting, groups for comparison are dened based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which species the groups that will be compared during DGE anal-ysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceightversus ground and ground versus spaceight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientic questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data les from each sample are listedand re-ordered (to match the order the samples appe ar in the metadata), then imported with the R pack- age, tximport ( Soneson et al., 2015 ), and sample names are assigned.

For datasets that contain samples with ERCC spike-in, we use the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script ( Data S1). To reduce the possibility of skewing the data during DESeq2 normalization ( McIntyre et al., 2011 ;Risso et al., 2011 ;Conesa et al., 2016 ;Law et al., 2016 ), all genes that have a sum of less than 10 counts across all samples are removed. The cutoff value of 10 is a best practice recommended by the DESeq2 tutorial onBioconductor. These ltered data are then prepared for normalization and DGE analysis with DESeq2. Because there is no consensus for whether or not ERCC-normalization improves the accuracy of the results (Risso et al., 2014 ), the GeneLab project and its AWG members decided to perform the DGE analysis both with and without ERCC-normalization (for datas ets with samples containing ERCC spike-in). To enable DESeq2 analysis with and without considering ERCC reads, the DESeqDataSet object is used to create a DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads. Because all samples must contain ERCC spike-in for ERCC-normalization, the DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads is used to identify and remove any samples that do not contain ERCC reads. Next, a DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads is created by removing rows containing ERCC reads. These data are then used for DESeq2analysis. For DESeq2 analysis with ERCC-normalization ( Data S2 ), the size factor object of the non-ERCC data is re- placed with group B ERCC size factors for re-scaling in the rst DESeq2 step. Group B ERCC genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. Therefore, only group B ERCC genes are used for gener- ating the size factors for re-scaling duirng ERCC-normalization. For DESeq2 analysis without ERCC-normal-ization, the DESeq2 default algorithm is applied to the DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCCreads. The unnormalized and DESeq2-normalize d count data as well as the sample table are then outputted as CSV les. The Unnormalized_Counts.csv, Normalized_Counts.csv, and ERCC_Normali- zed_Counts.csv les for each RNA-seq dataset are a vailable in the GeneLab Data Repository; the Sam- pleTable.csv le is used internally for verifying and validating the processed data prior to publication. There are two types of hypothesis tests that can be run with DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression and allows for comparison across all groups, and the Wald test, in which the estimated standard error of a log2 fold change is used to compare differences between two groups. The DGE step of the RCP performs both of these analyses. Afternormalization, the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data (both ERCC- andnonERCC-normalized data) to generate the F statistic p value, which is similar to an ANOVA p value and reveals genes that are changed in any number of combinations of all factors dened in the experiment. To prepare for building a genepathwa y annotation database, the STRINGdb ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 )a n d PANTHER.db ( Thomas 2003 ) libraries are loaded, and the organism s.csv le is read and used to indicate the Bioconductor AnnotationData Package needed ( Huber et al., 2015 ;Gentleman et al., 2004 ). The current gene annotation database for the organism specied at the beginning of the R script is then loaded. Next, DGE tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise DGE results, and current gene annotations as well as computer-readable DGE tables (that will be used for visualization) are created rst with nonERCC-normalized data and then with ERCC-normalized data. For pairwise DGE analysis, rst normalized count data are used to create two output tables: one that is used to create the human-readableDGE output table provided to users with processed data for each dataset and the other respective com-puter-readable DGE output table that contains additional columns and is used to visualize the data. Next, normalized count data are iterated through Wald Tests to generate pairwise comparisons of all groups based on the contrasts matrix that was generated during metadata formatting. The pairwiseDGE analysis results are then added as columns to both DGE output tables. Then an annotation database is built by rst dening th e keytype, which indicates the primary type of annotation used (for most GeneLab datasets this is ENSEMBL). The keytype is then used to map to anno- tations in the organism-specic Bioconductor AnnotationData Package, and the following annotation col- umns are added to the annotation database: SYMB OL, GENENAME, ENSEMBL (if not the primary),ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 24, 102361, April 23, 2021 9iScienc e ArticleREFSEQ, and ENTREZID. STRING and GOSLIM annotation columns are also added to the annotation data- base using the STRINGdb and PANTHER.db R packages, respectively. All of the aforementioned annota- tion columns are added to the annotation database to enable users to perform downstream analyses without having to map gene IDs themselves. Once the annotation database is complete, additional calcu-lations are performed on the normalized count data before assembling the nal DGE output tables. Means and standard deviations of normalized count d ata for each gene across all samples, and for sam- ples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the DGE output tables.A column containing the F statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added to the DGE output tables. The following columns are added only to the computer-readable DGE output table (used for visualization): a column to indicate whether each gene (or pathway) is up- or downregulated for eachpairwise comparison, a column to indicate genes that are differentially expressed using a p value cutoff of0.1 and another column using a p value cutoff of 0.05, a column indicating the log2 of the p value for each pairwise comparison and another column indicating the log2 of the adjusted p value, both ofwhich are used to create Volcano plots. After all columns are added to the DGE tables, both the human- and computer-readable DGE tables are combined with the current annotation database to create the complete human- and computer-readable DGE tables. An example of the complete human readableD G Et a b l e sp r o v i d e dw i t hp r o c e s s e dR N A s e qd a t a s e t si nt h eG e n e L a bD a t aR e p o s i t o r yi ss h o w ni nTables 1 and 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) is al so performed on the normalized count data and used to create PCA plots for the GeneLab data visu alization portal. DGE analysis of datasets without ERCC spike-in is performed exactly the same way as the nonERCC-normalized approach described above, except that no ERCC reads have to be remov ed from the DESeqDataSet object prior to DESeq analysis. Both the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R and the GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R scripts produce the following output les: Unnormalized_Counts.csv (), Normalized_Counts.csv (), SampleTable.csv (), contrasts.csv (), differential_expression.csv (), visualization_output_table.csv (), visualization_PCA_table.csv () ( Fig- ure 5 B). The GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script will also produce the following additional output les: ERCC_rawCounts_unltered.csv (), ERCC_rawCounts_ltered.csv (), ERCCnorm_contrasts.csv (), ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv (), ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv (), visualization_output_ table_ERCCnorm.csv (), visualization_PCA_table_ERCCnorm.csv () ( Tables 1 and 2). To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data from each step of the pipeline, downstream analyses were performedusing processed data from select samples from RNAseq datasetshosted on GeneLab. One of the advantages of providing expression data of all samples in each dataset as well as all possible pairwise DGE comparisons is to allow users the exibility to pick and choose which samples and which comparisons they would like to focus on. Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercisedthisexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasetssamples that met a specic set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals own in space and respective ground controlsamples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to eval- uate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expres-sion.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv les from these two da- tasets were used for downstream analyses.Table 1.

The rst 7 columns of the differential ge ne expres- sion output table contain gene IDs and annotations (for remainder of columns, refer to Table 2 ).ll OPEN ACCESS 10 iScience 24, 102361, April 23, 2021iScienc e ArticlePrior to downstream analysis, the processed data les were ltered so that only samples that met the criteria listed above were included. Because GLDS-168 contains samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and RR-3 missions and only the RR-1 mission met o ur rst criteria of using the C57BL6 mouse strain, RR-3 samples were removed from the process data les. GLDS-168 processed data les were subsequentlyltered to remove all samples, except spaceight (F LT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, whichincluded a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after C2430 days of spaceight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of C2460 days before being sacriced aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceight animals described). Theformer set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processeddata les were ltered to remove all other samples. I n addition, because the downstream analyses focused on the differences between FLT and GC samples in these two datasets, all other comparisons were removed from the differential_expr ession.csv and ERCCnorm_different ial_expression.csv les prior to analysis. The ltered processed data les (availa b l ei nM e n d e l e yD a t a ,M e n d e l e yD a t a : https:doi.org10.17632 fv3kd6h7k4.1 ) were then used to create Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots ( Figures 6 A, 6B, S1A, and S1B), heatmaps containing the top 30 most signica nt FLT versus GC differentially expressed (and an- notated) genes (adj. p value 0.05 and log2FC  1) ( Figures 6 C, 6D, S1C, and S1D), and to evaluate FLT versus GC gene ontology (GO) differences using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) analysis ( Tables 3 and S5). These results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression be- tween these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceight that are consistent across spaceight experiments. DISCUSSION The differentially expressed genes calculated by the RCP can be further explored with a variety of tools de- signed for higher-order analysis. For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein andor metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab work-ing group members include WebGestalt ( Liao et al., 2019 ), STRING ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 ), GSEA ( Subra- manian et al., 2005 ), PIANO ( Varemo et al. 2013 ), Reactome ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 ), and ToppFun ( Chen et al., 2009 ). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019 ). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. The RCP has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ERCC RNA spike-in mixa set of 96 polyadenylated RNAs that can be used during differential gene expression calcu- lation to normalize read counts across samples ( Munro et al., 2014 ). However, the use of normalizationTable 2. Differential gene expre ssion output tabl estatistics Norm. expr.

For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the G eneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing Figure 6.

Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume thatmost genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements be- tween libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. A high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes deter- mined by the RCP. However, conducting experiments in spaceight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. Therefore, it is important to note that at least three biologicalreplicates are required for the pipeline, specically for DESeq2, to perform its statistical methods. How-ever, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR) ( Schurch et al., 2016 ). Finally, RNA-seq datasets hosted on GeneLab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized (raw) counts are obtained, the step right before DESeq2 is used forDGE calculation. More advanced RCP users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. For this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. The rst is in the output from STAR, mapping output is also pro- vided in genomic coordinates. This is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the referencetranscriptome. For example, this may be used to nd novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. The second part of the pipeline with alternative output les is RSEM. This also provides transcript-level counts that can be used t o investigate differential isoform expression. More- over, intermediate les are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that theynd useful. The GeneLab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. As discussed in this article, the RCP is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the AWG is still debating the best approach for cross-dataset comparisons bet ween microarrays. GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacic Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing ( Roberts et al. 2013 ) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) nanopore sequencing ( Jain et al., 2016 ). Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specically designed for the intricacies o f long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads ( Castro-Wallace et al., 2017 ). However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantagesfor RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identication of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE. To conclude, the RCP is specically designed for RNA-seq data from short-read sequencers and has been developed in order to encourage and facilitate ana lysis of spaceight multi -omic data. The creation of the RCP by a large community of scientists (GeneLab AWG: https:genelab.nasa.govawg )a n dt h e sharing of pipeline details in a peer-reviewed article provide analysis transparency and enable data reproducibility.Table 3.

In addition, the pipeline cannot compensate for poor library preparation technique or inadequate sample size. Sample preservation protocols between da-tasets need to also be evaluated, because variations in sample preservation protocol could lead to poorcorrelation between studies that are otherwise identical ( Lai Polo et al., 2020 ). The number of sequenced reads may also be a limiting factor in the usefulness and accuracy of the differentially expressed genes calculated by DESeq2 and, similarly, during splice isoform analysis. Note that this article does not discuss strategies and pipelines regarding older transcriptomics data in GeneLab (i.e. more than 100 microarray datasets), as it is much more challenging to provide meta-analysiswith microarrays, which are prone to strong batch effects and gene lists that are platform dependent. Future efforts of GeneLab and the AWG will address microarray pipelines. In the future, we will add functionality to process unique molecular identiers (UMIs) that can identify PCR duplicates using tools such as UMI tools ( Smith et al. 2017 ). This will allow PCR duplicates to be removed after mapping and before quantication. In addition, transcriptomic data will be integrated w ith proteomic and metabolomics data; this will help further understand the signicance of gene expression changes to metabolic tness in the spaceight environment.

Wyatt, LuisZea, Sylvain V. Costes, and Jonathan M. GalazkaSupplemental Information Transparent Methods The tools used in the consensus pipeline are documented in Supplemental Table 4: Pipeline Tools and Links Table S4: Pipeline Tools and Links, Related to Transparent Methods. Due to NASA security requirements, all software is updated monthly with security patching. Therefore, tool versions used to process each RNA-seq dataset hosted on the GeneLab Data Repository are provided in the RNA-seq protocol section and are also available along with exact processing scripts in the GeneLab Data Processing GitHub Repository (https:github.comnasaGeneLab_Data_ProcessingtreemasterRNAseqGLDS_Processing_Scripts). Specific commands, options, and flags for each tool used in the RCP are reported in the figures of the main text. Note that some packages listed here are dependencies of the packages used in the RCP. More information about such dependencies can be found in the tool documentation. This pipeline has been run on short-read RNA-seq data in the GeneLab database ( https:genelab-data.ndc.nasa.govgenelabprojects ) and is applied to new submissions to the database. Any updates to the software used in the pipeline will be noted in the Github repository GeneLab_Data_Processing (https:github.comnasaGeneLab_Data_Processing ). There are currently over 80 RNA -seq datasets available Table S1: GeneLab RNA-Seq Datasets, Related to Transparent Methods. Processed RNAseq data from GLDS-168 and GLDS-245 select samples were used to provide an example of the downstream analyses that can be done using data processed with the consensus pipeline presented here. Normalized counts and ERCC-normalized counts from the following GLDS-168 and GLDS-245 samples were used to generate the PCA plots shown in Figure 6A  6B and Supplemental Figure 1A  1B, respectively. Samples from GLDS-168 and GLDS-245 that were used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table 5 Table S5: Sample Names, Related to Figure 6 . Differential gene expression (DGE) data from FLT versus GC samples using (non-ERCC) normalized counts and ERCC-normalized counts data for each respective dataset were used to generate the heatmaps shown in Figure 6C  6D and Supplemental Figure 1C  1D, respectively. DGE data were filtered using an adjusted p value cutoff of  0.05 and log2FC cutoff of  1. The gene expression data were then sorted based on adjusted p values and the top 30 most differentially expressed and annotated genes were used to generate heatmaps with ggplot2 version 3.3.2 (Wickham, Navarro, and Pedersen 2016) . Note that for visualization purposes, sample names were shortened. Pairwise gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the (non-ERCC) normalized counts (Table 3) and ERCC-normalized counts Table S6 from select samples in GLDS-168 andGLDS-245 using the C5: Gene Ontology (GO) gene set (MSigDB v7.2) as described (Subramanian et al. 2005) . All comparisons were performed using the phenotype permutation. The ranked lists of genes were defined by the signal-to-noise metric and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the gene set. FDR  0.25 were considered significant for comparisons according to the authors recommendation. The data used to generate all PCA plots, heatmaps, and GSEA shown are provided on Mendeley ( http:dx.doi.org10.17632fv3kd6h7k4.1 ). Supplemental FiguresFigure S1 (Related to Figure 6).

Comparison of gene ontology in ERCC-normalized spaceflight versus ground control liver samples from GeneLab datasets.

For GO terms, the number on the left corresponds to GO terms enriched in FLT samples and the number on the right corresponds to GO terms enriched in GC samples.
