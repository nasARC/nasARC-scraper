For example, for humans the closed environment of space vehicles alongside enforced con nement, and the isolation inherent in the vast distances traveled all have important impacts on the functioning of the crew s physiology and psychology (Fig. 1). Many of these effects are being explored in Earth-based analogs, such as the Hawaii Space Analog and Simulation and the Scienti c International Research in Unique Terrestrial Station missions 1,2. However, some features of space are complex or impossible to simulate on the Earth s surface, requiring explora- tion through the relatively rare opportunity of a space ight experiment. For example, exposure to sustained microgravity andto the increased ionizing radiation in space are both beyond the experience of terrestrial biology, and currently almost impossible to mimic on the Earth s surface. Thus, their individual and combined effects on biology remain poorly understood, yet these are likely to be critical factors in how organisms respond to livingin space. A combination of the shielding effects of the atmosphere and the ability of the magnetosphere to de ect radiation around the planet means, that for most of Earth s history its organisms have been relatively protected from space radiation. Although terres- trial life does encounter natural background radiation fromgeological sources and UV radiation from the Sun, it is low by comparison to space, with an average annual dose equivalent per person in the US of around 6 mSv 3, depending on altitude and soil composition (e.g., the presence of minerals that produce radon gas). In deep space, the radiation exposures will be much higher and include highly ionizing single particles not normally found onEarth. Based on data from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) during its cruise phase from Earth to Mars and the measurements it made on theMartian surface, the crew on a 1000 day mission to Mars, assuming quiet periods of solar activity throughout, wouldreceive 360 mGy absorbed dose, much of it from highly ionizing galactic cosmic ray (GCR) ions 4,5. This is similar to several decades of absorbed background dose on Earth, but as noted, from a very different spectrum of radiation and delivered at a very different dose rate. All of these factors are likely to play into the precise effects this radiation exposure will have on the crew of such amission, making it complex to extrapolate from terrestrial models to the space ight environment. Indeed, the effects of exposure to space radiation have been shown to induce more deleterious effects in tissues than similar doses of ionizing radiation on Earth, with, e.g., as much as 40 times more biological effectiveness to induce Harderian gland cancers inmice 6.H o w e v e r ,i na d d i t i o nt oi n d u c i n gc a n c e r ,r a d i a t i o ne x p o s u r ei n mammals can lead to a wide array of cellular and microenvironment e f f e c t ss u c ha sc h r o n i ci n ammation, tissue degeneration and impaired nerve function (e.g., refs.7,8). Indeed, all organisms are subject to radiation effects, with animals, microbes, and plantsexperiencing a variety of radiation-induced cellular events ranging from DNA damage and oxidative stress to shifts in metabolism 9,10. Different species exhibit varying degrees of radiation tolerance andwithin a species radiation response is modulated by an individual s genetics 1114. For example, bacteria in the genus Deinococcus can survive radiation doses far in excess of those that would be lethal in humans15. Predicting such effects are further confounded by the inuence of the space ight environment, such as living in microgravity, which itself modulates an organism sr a d i a t i o n response (e.g., refs.1618). These complexities in potential biological effects coupled with the relatively limited opportunities to perform direct space ight experiments make assessing the risks of radiation exposure to crew members on extended, deep space missionsextremely dif cult 19,20. Yet, as the duration and distances of space ight missions increase, the question of how different organisms respond to the effects of increased space radiationexposure and the potential for interactions with, e.g., the micro- g r a v i t yo fs p a c e ight becomes increasingl y important to address. 1Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.2Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA, USA.3Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA.4Wyle Labs, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA, USA.5Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Microbial Sciences Building, Madison, WI, USA.email: dr.richard.barkergmail.com; sgilroywisc.eduwww.nature.comnpjmgrav Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA1234567890():,;To date, much biology-focused space ight experimentation has been published without its assoc iated radiation data and though radiation exposure has usually been recorded, it is often not readily accessible. This gap has been re cognized by the NASA GeneLab project, which acts as a repository for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from experiments own in space or exposed to simulated space stressors2123. Alongside the raw omics datasets, the GeneLab data repository organizes associated metadata into a publicly accessib le database called the GeneLab Data System (GLDS21,22). Mining of GeneLab s omics data then enables exploration of the network of molecular responses to space environments as a function of experimental factors described in the metadata. GeneLab has now aggregated much of the radiation metadata associated with its space ight-related datasets24.I no t h e r words, the GLDS now provides the raw materials of data and metadata for making broad inferences about radiation effects across multiple sets of space ight experiments and in different organisms. The GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) also enables access to these data by external web applications, with the aim of allowing the scienti c community to deploy custom tools to visualize and explore these data in ways complementary to the capabilities available in GeneLab s own data visualization portal. In the work presented here, we introduce one such custom visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App ( https:astrobiology.botany. wisc.eduastro-rad-bio-app ). Rad-Bio-App capitalizes on the FAIR- ness standards and rich data curation of the GLDS25to provide an interactive graphical interface through which investigators canvisualize, lter, and compare radiation dosimetry and other metadata across the GLDS. The reiterative ltering capabilities of Rad-Bio-App further allow the user to de ne datasets with potentially common radiation effects, or to explore interactions between radiation exposure and a variety of space-related experimental conditions. These datasets then provide targets for further in-depth analyses using a variety of bioinformatics- related tools. Overall design and goals of the Rad-Bio-App The overall goal of the Rad-Bio-App is to allow users to develop ltered, curated lists of omics datasets within the GeneLab data repository, that can then be explored for predicted radiation- related responses. Therefore, documenting the origin of such datais of paramount importance and is central to the Rad-Bio-App s data structure outlined in Fig. 2. Sources of these space ight datasets include experiments performed on the Space Shuttle, theInternational Space Station (ISS), satellites (including the Russian Bion and Foton) and the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Ground data are typically from experiments that use terrestrial radiation sources such as particle accelerators and gamma, x-ray, and neutron sources. We have also incorporated summary information from high altitude balloons on Earth 26and orbital and surface data from the Moon, from the journey from Earth to Mars and from the Martian surface by importing data from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)27, the RAD instrument of the Mars Science Laboratory4,5,28, the Lunar Lander Neutrons and Dosimetry (LND) experiment mounted on the Chang E 4 lunar lander2931 and aggregate data from the Apollo astronauts Radiation Survey Meters (RSM)32. CRaTER provides data on radiation in lunar orbit and LND for the lunar surface. The RAD measured radiation exposure while both in transit to Mars and on the Martian surface. Supplementary Table 1 presents a summary of these balloon, lunar and Mars-related data. When combined with the linked GeneLab metadata of features such as species, hardware, and radiation type, this data architecture allows the user to explore, lter, and compare the radiation environments experienced across many different types of space biology studies and even those of likely future missions. The resulting lists of GLDS datasets selected for speci c characteristics of radiation exposure, then offer the possibility of further interrogating the associated omics data within GeneLab, employing either GeneLab s visualization portal tools or other custom techniques (e.g., for plants, exploration within the TOAST database33). Such approaches allow the researcher to search for molecular ngerprints between experiments that are associated with common or different radiation exposures, and also ask how other factors within the experiment may be impacting these responses. The Rad-Bio-App should therefore help the scienti c community both explore how biology responds to ionizing radiation exposure in the context of space ight, and also help identify space radiation conditions currently not being simulated on the ground. It is important to note here that within the data visualization portal on the GeneLab website users can search for omics datasetsrelated to speci c radiation metadata classes: radiation type, energy, dose, and dose rate. Rad-Bio-App complements these capabilities by extending the range and details of the searchable radiation metadata, and providing an interactive ability to apply quantitative lters simultaneously across all datasets. To give one example of the utility of implementing such extended capabilities: for operational reasons related to the available radiation source, there is a great deal of data from ground-based studies on a number of different organisms exposed to iron ions at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Fig. 3). Thus, these datasets potentially provide a wealth of insight by comparing experiments with similar irradiation characteristics. A user who is expert in this area would know to search for this type of radiation exposure to aggregate this extensive set of results, a task addressable through GeneLab s visualization portal. Using the Rad-Bio-App, a biologist relatively new to the space radiation eld would quickly identify iron as a radiation type that is rich in datasets through simple exploration of the graphical representation of the aggregate terrestrial radiation data (Fig. 3). Further, they could rapidly de ne whether their species of interest lie within these datasets. Thus, Rad-Bio-App should also help to broaden access and usage of these kinds of data 23by allowing researchers who do not specialize in radiation biology to begin to incorporate potential radiation effects into their analyses and experimental designs. Fig. 1 Physical and biological factors affecting human space exploration and their associated stressors including isolation,long con nement in closed environments, microgravity, and ionizing radiation. These factors are likely to act both alone and in combination to impose effects on the crew in space.R. Barker et al. 2 npj Microgravity (2021) 15 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA1234567890():,;Fig. 2 Rad-Bio-App s data structure. Rad-Bio-App imports datasets from ground-based space radiation simulations, space ight experiments, the RAD detector of the Curiosity Rover, the CRaTER instrument on the lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the LRD of the Chang E 4 lunar lander, the RaD-X high altitude balloon and dosimetry from Apollo missions. These datasets are linked in a relational database within the Qlik datamanagement system. At the time of writing, the App contains data from 132 accessions, each with associated metadata including: Accession, GeneLab GLDS-Accession , Radiation Sub-Accession (individual GLDS accessions contain data from multiple treatments, which we de ne as sub-accessions and denote as GLDS., e.g., GLDS-93.1, GLDS-93.2 etc.), organism, analysis type (trancriptomics, genomics, metabolomics etc.), radiation type, particle charge, particle mass, radiation source, particle LET (keVm), energy (MeV classi ed to ions, gamma-rays, or x- rays), minimal radiation group, total absorbed radiation dose (Gy), summary dose rate (Gyday), exposure duration, general radiation group,vehicle (for space ight experiments), sample location, (for space ight experiments), and dosimeter type.R. Barker et al. 3 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2021) 15 The characteristics of the radiation data within Rad-Bio-App Space radiation comprises a mix of particles and energies arising from the Sun and the background galactic cosmic radiation (GCR)that originates outside of the Solar System 34. Therefore, Rad-Bio- App provides ltering tools to help navigate some of these intricacies. Solar particles consist of an intense ux of mostly protons and electrons with energies up to about 100 keV, butsporadic solar particle events can accelerate these particles tohigher energies (about 1 10 MeV 35). GCR consists of protons and heavier ions ejected from supernovae and can be even moreenergetic (above 100 MeVnucleon). Nuclear or electromagneticinteractions of such primary radiation with other materials, such asthe hull or shielding within a spacecraft can also lead theproduction of secondary particles. These secondary particlesinclude protons, neutrons, and light charged fragments, whichcan themselves be highly penetrating and, as for solar particlesand GCR, biologically damaging 6. To help address this complexity in the spectrum of the types of radiation that may be present in anexperiment, the Rad-Bio-App allows ltering of the data for speci c energies and doses and, for the terrestrial studies with well-de ned radiation sources, by the radiation quality (e.g., alpha, Fe nucleus, proton, etc.). In relation to effects on biological systems, a further key characteristic of radiation is the energy it can deliver over adistance traveled (its Linear Energy Transfer, or LET, typicallyexpressed in kiloelectron volts per micrometer; keVm). Low LETradiation is loosely de ned to consist of particles with 10 keV m, such as protons and electrons, whereas high LET radiation is composed of energetic nuclei with greater penetrating power andconsequently a greater potential to damage biological mole-cules 36. However, even low LET radiation can still readily disrupt biological processes through effects such as DNA damage andoxidative stress 37,38. Therefore, the Rad-Bio-App allows ltering on the LET of the radiation quality when known.The dose vs. dose rate challenge One other major challenge in studying the effects of space radiation on biology is the dif culty of simulating the spectrum of space radiation conditions in the laboratory, whether on theground or in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This issue makes it important to place the inferences a researcher can draw from Rad-Bio-App- based analyses in this context. Particle accelerator facilities onEarth, such as the NSRL, can provide low absolute doses to try tomimic expected radiation exposure in space but generally thesehave to be delivered in an acute manner, i.e., at dose rates on the order of Gymin, compared to the typical rates of hundreds of Gyday that are experienced in Space. In addition, until recently,exposures in these ground-based experiments were limited to oneparticle type at one energy at a time, whereas, as discussed above,space radiation represents a complex mix of radiation types. Rad- Bio-App provides lters for dose rate and particle types, when known, to help place these space radiation analog experiments incontext. Fortunately, ground facilities, while still limited torelatively high dose rates, are developing more sophisticatedmixed eld capabilities that promise to more closely mimic the spectrum of particles eliciting space radiation effects. However, it remains a signi cant challenge to perform faithful space radiation- related analog experiments on the ground, and so it is critical toremember these issues when conducting Rad-Bio-App analyses. Orbiting spacecraft offer dose rates more appropriate for understanding space-related effects on biology, but again whenusing the Rad-Bio-App for comparisons between datasets it is important to be aware of the effects of the locale on the radiation environment. Thus, although particle types are generally notrecorded for experiments conducted in space ight (Rad-Bio-App classes these as Mixed radiation), the effects of shielding from the magnetosphere means that radiation exposures in LEO willlikely have a much higher proton contribution than will exploration missions traveling to the Moon and beyond. Future missions such as Artemis 39, Lunar Gateway40, and BioSentinel41 promise to provide data from biology operating well beyondthese confounding effects of LEO. Both the GeneLab data systemand Bio-Rad-App are designed to readily incorporate information from these new facilities and missions as they become available to help more faithfully align future analyses to the range of likelyspace radiation pro les. Architecture of the Rad-Bio-App exploration environment Rad-Bio-App is built using the Qlik database management software (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA).Radiation data have been aggregated from NASA s GeneLab data repository 21,23and data recorded by the RaD-X high-altitude balloon mission, CRaTER, the RAD, the LRD and on Apollomissions. These datasets and associated metadata were thenmanually curated and linked through the Qlik software engine toprovide a searchable relational database (Fig. 2). Qlik provides customizable interactive representations of datasets, allowing for their presentation as a simple graphical user interface built arounddata-centric dashboards. Data lters are incorporated allowing the user to rapidly narrow searches and comparisons by e.g.,organism, radiation type, or mission and these lters then spawn to all other datasets and analysis dashboards, allowing the user to reiteratively narrow their search and comparisons across thebreadth of all the data within Rad-Bio-App as described below. Navigating the Rad-Bio-App: dashboards Rad-Bio-App is navigated through an initial menu or index page that presents icons and brief descriptions linking to additional pages ordashboards, as shown in Fig. 4. Each dashboard simpli es the access to a particular kind of radiation data along with the visualization and ltering tools to be able to explore those datasets. Fig. 3 Datasets for terrestrial experiments exposing biology to different radiation types that are deposited at GeneLab and cross- referenced within the Rad-Bio-App. Shown inset is the distribution of species for the Fe datasets. Mixed LEO represents the varied arrayof space ight data. Output extracted from elements of Rad-Bio- App s graphical interface.R. Barker et al. 4 npj Microgravity (2021) 15 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASADashboard 1 lets the researcher nd datasets by radiation exposure level. Users land on a summary of the average radiationexposure each organism experienced during an experimentindexed to the relevant dataset within the GeneLab data repository.These radiation data can be further ltered on metadata factors such as radiation type, radiation source, and exposure levels. Dashboard 2 lets the user nd datasets by the type of radiation from different sources. One will notice in this dashboard that alarge number of datasets are classi ed as LEO experiments (e.g., ISS, Space Shuttle), whereas radiation data related to terrestrialexperimentation allows, e.g., selecting the particle of interest (e.g.,1 GeVn Fe). The Rad-Bio-App provides additional ltering of these datasets on features such as organism and the analytical approach used to assess biological response (e.g., transcriptomics, genomics,and proteomics). Dashboard 3 lets the user focus on experiments conducted in space, which typically have much lower dose rates than experimentson Earth and re ect chronic exposure lasting days to weeks. As such, the dashboard lands on a graph displaying radiation doses as afunction of duration. One can sub-select these space ight-related experiments by l t e r i n gf o r ,e . g . ,m i s s i o n ,d o s i m e t e r ,a n d ight hardware. It is important to note that, unlike terrestrial radiationexperiments that use de ned radiation sources, the precise kinds of particles responsible for the radiation exposure in most space ight experiments are not measured and so, as noted above, they aregrouped collectively as Mixed radiation exposures on this dash- board. Therefore, the lter for radiation source or group in dashboard 3 is based on the region of space, where themeasurement was taken (such as LEO) rather than speci cr a d i a t i o n type as available for the terrestrial studies in the previous dashboard. Dashboard 4 provides an example of a comparative analysis between maximum, minimum and average lunar orbit, lunar surface, Martian surface, and Earth-to-Mars transit radiation doses versus the wealth of space ight and terrestrial biological experiments available at NASA s GeneLab data repository. The long duration of data capture for these Moon-space and Mars-space measurements means that elements such as intense solarparticle events, when the Sun emits extremely high levels ofradiation for a short duration, can impact on average measure-ments. Therefore, in addition to maximum and minimum exposures, Rad-Bio-App presents several average exposure rates for the lunar and Martian datasets. These averages include bothvalues with high intensity stochastic events included andmeasurements drawn from periods, when these events did notoccur (summarized in Supplementary Table 1). For the Martiandata, we also present average measurements from the RAD sS i detector and the Si detector data corrected for radiationpenetration into water. This latter measurement provides a closer analog of how the radiation is likely interacting with biology than the Si detector s raw output. This correction relies upon a calculation from the Si detector s measurement using a dose conversion factor, and so should be taken as an approximation 5. Glossary Dashboard: Finally, the App also presents a glossary of terms on the main dashboard index page and mousing over thistable reveals a full screen expansion icon, allowing the glossaryto be seen on a single browser page. The homepage of the Fig. 4 Navigation within Rad-Bio-App is through dashboards accessed from a central menu page. Each data exploration dashboard allows for reiterative, interactive ltering on factors such as radiation type, mission, and space ight hardware and allows for both dynamic visualization of the lter effects and for export of the ltered data to a spreadsheet.R. Barker et al. 5 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2021) 15 Rad-Bio-App also links to a video tutorial, which leads potential users through accessing some of the basic functions of the App. Test case: understanding radiation biology on the lunar surface The Rad-Bio-App is designed to allow researchers rapid access to data on the radiation environment of a particular study and to make easy comparisons across datasets to reveal new insight. Asan example, we have used Rad-Bio-App to explore possible effectsof the radiation in the lunar environment. Thus, as the sights ofthe space ight community begin to widen to include crewed missions to the Moon and eventually Mars, it becomes crucial toask how radiation will affect biology under these conditions.However, to date, with the exception of the 27 Apollo astronautswho travelled to the Moon and the short duration of the seedlinggermination experiment in China s Chang E-4 mission 29,30,w ehave no data on the functioning of biology in the lunar environment. How then to make predictions about the radiationeffects to inform the future missions to this destination? Rad-Bio- App incorporates direct radiation measurements made by CRaTER as it orbits the Moon, from the Chang E-4 lander on the lunar surface and aggregate data from astronaut dosimetry on theApollo missions. Thus, Rad-Bio-App allows ltering the array of LEO space ight and terrestrial data from NASA s Genelab repository for radiation exposures lying close those expected forthe lunar environs. An example of this kind of analysis is shown inFigs. 5and 6, using Dashboard 4 of the Rad-Bio-App. For this analysis, we explored the lunar surface environment and so usedthe direct measurements of lunar surface radiation made byChang E 4 to ask, if there were datasets within the GeneLab data repository that might help inform on how biology would actunder these radiation conditions. Brie y, we took the average mixed lunar surface radiation dose rate from the LRD detector on Fig. 5 Example of use of Rad-Bio-App to de ne datasets within the GeneLab data repository mimicking a lunar surface exposure. The data within dashboard 4 of the Rad-Bio-App contains radiation data from Martian, lunar and space ight missions and ground-based radiation experiments. These data were ltered using radiation levels recorded on the lunar surface by the Chang e 4 lander, with limits set to span a 2-fold range around the average dose rate (0.55 mGyd). Results of this ltering were then exported to build a listing of space ight experiment datasets within the GeneLab data repository where their radiation exposure lies within this range of dose rates. Green numbers intable, datasets pre-processed by either the GeneLab uniform microarray or RNAseq analysis pipelines.R. Barker et al. 6 npj Microgravity (2021) 15 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAChang E-4 (0.55 mGyday) and set limits of 2x 0.5x (i.e., searching for 1.1 to 0.25 mGyday see Fig. 5step 2), assuming it would broadly cover a likely lunar radiation dose rate. This approach identi ed 32 experiments (Fig. 5, step 3), generating a table at the bottom of the dashboard which we downloaded by clicking on the download icon (down green arrow in Fig. 5, step 4). Rad-Bio-App further showed that the corresponding datasets span ten different organisms. Here, we capitalized on the synergy possible between the well-curated data repository at GeneLab and the rapid dataset surveys possible through Rad-Bio-App. Thus, interrogating the GeneLab data repository revealed gene expres- sion analysis was performed on ight samples versus a paired ground control in most of the studies identi ed in the above analysis. Rad-Bio-App also readily showed that the majority (15) of these studies were from mice, with analyses of whole genome gene expression performed using either microarray or RNAseqtechnologies. In addition, cross-referencing to the GeneLab visualization portal revealed that most of these datasets have been processed through GeneLab s uniform microarray or RNAseq software pipelines (Overbey et al.42). That is, these datasets have been pre-processed within the GeneLab data system using the same computational approaches, and the analyzed results on differential gene expression deposited and made publicly avail- able for download. Briey, for these analytical pipelines, the GeneLab analyses were implemented in the Galaxy software environment43,w i t ht h e microarray analysis using the RBioconductor software packageLimma44and RNA-seq using STAR (v2.7.1a45)a n dR S E M( v 1 . 3 . 146). Further descriptions of the processing and links to the analytical codes used, along with the deposited analyzed datasets are available on the Genelab website22. Application of the same analytical steps f o re a c hd a t a s e ta l l o w sf o rm u c hm o r er o b u s tc o m p a r i s o n sb e t w e e n studies, and the free access to the deposited results greatly speeds and simpli es subsequent exploration. These analyses then provided us with target datasets within the GeneLab data repository to explore for common molecular signatures from biology experiencing radiation dose rates similar towhat we might predict on future missions to the Moon. One must note here that comparing microarray and RNAseq datasets can be complex to perform and interpret due to potential artifacts generated by mixing results fr om these different analytical technologies (e.g., ref.47). Therefore, to increase the robustness of our further analyses, we focused on ve RNAseq datasets derived from the same mission: Rodent Research 6 (RR6)48. These RR6 datasets were from ve different tissues: dorsal skin, thymus, spleen, colon, and lung, respectively (i.e., GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, and 248) and they were processed using the GeneLab RNAseq pipeline42. These datasets had multiple contro ls: tissues were either collected from sacri ced animals and then preserved (i.e., euthanasia), versus where the whole animal was rst frozen (to be dissected later by t h a w i n g )a tt h es a m et i m ea sc a r c a s s e sp r e s e r v e di ns p a c eb y astronauts (i.e., carcass). Another factor differentiating various controls were animals sacri ced just before the mission (i.e., basal control) versus animals sacri ced on the ground at the same time as Fig. 6 Analysis of radiation responsive mouse genes showing altered expression in space ight. a Log 2-fold change of differentially expressed genes ( ight vs ground or ight vs. basal) from mouse RNAseq datasets identi ed from Fig. 5(GLDS 243, 244, 246, 247, 248) were cross-referenced to genes annotated as being radiation responsive in the RadAtlas database50.bOntology enrichment analysis performed using Metascape51. Ground control is sample harvested synchronously with ight samples, basal control are samples harvested immediately prior to ight.R. Barker et al. 7 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2021) 15 in space (i.e., ground control GC). Such experimental factors were recently described in detail and their impact on gene expression discussed49.T h e s e ve different tissues provided ten ight-to-basal- control and veight-to-GC comparisons within the pre-processed datasets deposited at GeneLab, and so we downloaded the geneexpression data for these 15 comparisons from the GeneLab data repository for further analysis. We next interrogated the RadAtlas50, a tool that provides an aggregation of gene expression pro les of radiation-associated and radiation-responsive genes drawn from the ground-based literature. We downloaded the aggregated data from the RadAtlas and asked, which of the genes identi ed as transcriptionally responsive to radiation in that tool also showed transcriptional changes in themouse space ight RNAseq datasets described above (Supplemen- tary Data 1). We then ltered this list to ask, of these genes, which of them showed agreement in either induction or repression inspace ight to greater than 2-fold in at least four of the mouse datasets. To increase the rigor of this ltering, we set the further criterion that no dataset showed a con icting response. i.e., if four or more datasets showed induction of a particular gene, none ofthe other datasets also showed repression at the 2-fold cutoff (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 1). This thresholding allowed us to identify putative shared radiation response genes whilst ltering out those showing small or inconsistent responses. We then usedthe gene network annotation and analysis tool Metascape 51to visualize the functional groupings (ontologies) associated with these sets of genes (Fig. 6b). This list showed enrichment in features ranging from T-cell apoptosis, to DNA repair and the regulation of the cell cycle, providing targets for future exploration of possible radiation effects in the space ight environment through e.g., targeted ight experimentation. CONCLUSIONS To conclude, we have introduced a data mining visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App, enabling the rapid identi cation of omics datasets deposited in the NASA GeneLab data repository, which are relevant for a speci c space ight radiation scenario (e.g., trip to Mars or on the lunar surface) or speci c characteristics of radiation exposure. Testing this tool on a scenario of a mission on the Moon, we identi ed a series of experiments conducted on the ISS with similar radiation pro les. Because the Rad-Bio-App links to GeneLab datasets, it was then straightforward to extract processed gene expression tables from GeneLab to identify common pathways that may be modi ed by, in this case, the lunar surface radiation environment. As more researchers enterdatasets into GeneLab related to space ight and radiation exposure that explore the effects of e.g., species, genetics, gender, and age, the Rad-Bio-App should become an increasingly power-ful tool to help accelerate assessment of the effects of Spaceradiation environments on living entities.
