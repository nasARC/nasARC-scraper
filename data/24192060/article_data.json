BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241Background Bacteria can sense changes in their surroundings and modulate their gene expression and physiology to adaptto a range of environmental conditions. A unique con- dition that bacteria encounter during spaceflight is sig- nificantly reduced gravity, known as microgravity 1,2.Many studies have shown that the microgravity environ- ment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial physiology, including increased growth rate, antibioticresistance, and virulence 3. The effects of microgravity on final cell density have been described for several bac- terial species, including Escherichia coli 4-9, Bacillus subtilis 10,11, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi- murium (hereafter referred to as Salmonella ) 12,13. A number of these studies have shown increased final celldensity during spaceflight, while others have not observed significant differences between spaceflight and normal gravity conditions 14. Interestingly, independent studiesof the same species have also yielded differing results, where some examining E. coli during spaceflight have reported increased final cell density 5,8, and others havereported no differences relative to normal gravity controls 4,6. Some studies have been repeated on multiple shuttle missions and yielded consistent results 13,15, suggestingthat these differences are likely not due to issues with experimental design or reproducibility. As such, we hypo- thesize that these discrepancies may be attributed to dif-ferences in media and culture conditions, in addition to differences in how individual species respond to the microgravity environment. Benoit and Klaus have suggested that differences in motility may be responsible for some of these inconsist- ent observations 14. They hypothesize non-motile bac-teria have an advantage under spaceflight conditions due to a lack of cell settling and the resulting increases in local nutrient availability in the well-mixed environment,while motile cells are able to move actively towards nu- trients under both normal and microgravity conditions 14. Indeed, a previous spaceflight experiment, con-ducted by Thvenet et al., found that growth in micro- gravity increased the final cell density of a non-motile E. coli mutant lacking motB relative to normal gravity, while no differences were observed with the motile par- ent 9. However, further studies are needed to examinewhether motility plays a universal role in affecting mi- crobial growth in microgravity. Recent studies have also indicated that media conditions can modulate how microgravity affects bacterial physiology 15-17. Salmonella cultured in Lennox broth (LB) during spaceflight exhibited increased virulence in a murine modelof infection compared to controls where Salmonella was grown on Earth. However, the use of M9 media or the addition of the inorganic ion components of M9 to LB wasobserved to mitigate the enhanced virulence of Salmonellainduced during spaceflight 15 . A set of follow-up experi- ments tested the individual components of M9 and showed that the addition of phosphate alone to LBcould prevent the increase in acid tolerance observed when Salmonella is grown in low shear modeled micro- gravity (LSMMG) 15. In addition to phosphate, oxygen availability may also influence how bacteria grow and respond to the spa- ceflight environment. For example, oxygen is known toaffect many aspects of the growth and physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a facultative anaerobe, includ- ing growth, motility, and biofilm formation 18-20.P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and was attributed to the spaceflight infection of an astro- naut during Apollo 13 21,22. We recently examinedbiofilm formation by P. aeruginosa PA14, a virulent clinical isolate 23, and shown that differences in bio- film biomass observed between spaceflight and normalgravity can be minimized when oxygen availability is in- creased 24. Modeling efforts have suggested that oxy- gen transfer rates may be decreased under LSMMGconditions compared to normal gravity conditions 16, and a number of genes involved in anaerobic metabol- ism were found to be up-regulated when P. aeruginosa PAO1, a less virulent laboratory reference strain 25,26, was grown during spaceflight 17. These findings indi- cate that oxygen availability may influence bacterial re-sponses to spaceflight, and highlight the interplay between changes in the environment due to the direct or indirect effects of microgravity, such as reduced oxy-gen transport, and changes in microbial physiology. However, previous studies have not examined changes in the response of planktonic cells to the spaceflight en-v i r o n m e n tw h e no x y g e na v a i l a b i l i t yi sv a r i e d . The methods used to investigate microbial growth during spaceflight may also be responsible for some ofthe differences. To date, the measurement of bacterial cell density has most often been conducted after samples were returned to Earth due to constraints imposed bythe nature of such spaceflight experiments 27. The two methods of storing planktonic samples of bacteria grown during spaceflight prior to analysis used most frequently are the addition of a fixative to the culture 6,9,28 and the storage of live samples at low temperatures 4,5. Inthe present study, we assess the use of two methods for measuring microbial cell concentrations following growth during spaceflight: plate counting of live samples and flow cytometry (FCM) of fixed samples. Plate count- ing has the advantage of allowing the measurement of viable cell numbers. FCM is a fast and precise methodto count cells 29. Furthermore, this method is able to directly count hundreds of thousands of cells in a single sample, thereby facilitating the generation of statisticallymeaningful results.Kim et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 Page 2 of 10 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241We have investigated the effects of phosphate concen- tration, carbon source, oxygen availability and swimming motility on the final cell density of P. aeruginosa PA14 grown during spaceflight. Here, we demonstrate that the final cell density of P. aeruginosa is increased during spaceflight when culture conditions limit the availabilityof substrates required for growth. Specifically, growth during spaceflight led to an increase in final cell density when P. aeruginosa was cultured under low phosphate and low oxygen conditions. Increased availability of either phosphate or oxygen was observed to minimize the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density. Thesefindings indicate that effects of gravity on final cell dens- ity can be modulated by the availability of growth- limiting substrates. Results Two assays of final cell density show inconsistent measurements of spaceflight and normal gravity cultures grown in specialized hardware To examine how spaceflight affects final cell density, P. aeruginosa PA14 was grown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS-135 in specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA). FPAs have beenused extensively to culture microbes during spaceflight 8,13,15,17,24,30. As shown (Additional file 1: Figure S1), FPAs are glass barrels with a bevel on the side. Rubberstoppers are added to form compartments and the bevel enables mixing of the fluids from the different compart- ments via a plunging action. The first compartment wasloaded with modified artificial urine media (mAUM), which was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of bacterial growth31,32. Understanding how microbes grow in urine aboard a spacecraft or space station may be important for minimizing the potential for both future infections andmicrobial-based failures of the essential water and waste purification systems. Further, because mAUM is a chem- ically defined medium, it can be easily manipulated to testeffects of specific compounds on final cell density. The second compartment was loaded with cells used forinoculation stored in PBS. For fixed samples, a third com- partment was filled with a 9 wv paraformaldehyde solu- tion in PBS. Cultures were grown following the experiment time- line shown in Figure 1. Prior to inoculation, the FPAs were stored at 8C. Following inoculation, cells were cul-tured at 37C for 72 h. A subset of the cultures were fixed with paraformaldehyde immediately following the 72 h culture period and all cultures were subsequentlyincubated at 8C for approximately 48 h. This 48 h period corresponds to the time required for the shuttle to return to Earth, and storage at 8C during this periodminimized additional cell growth of viable cultures and increased the stability of the fixed samples 6,33. Plate counting was conducted immediately following shuttlelanding to determine the number of viable cells in the live samples. The paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were stained with DAPI and cell numbers were determined byflow cytometry (FCM). While we anticipated data from plate counting and FCM measurements of final cell concentration wouldyield similar results and reinforce each other, our ana- lysis showed very different results from the two methods under a number of conditions. This discrepancy betweenthe two methods was most pronounced when cells were cultured in mAUM containing 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). In mAUMg, FCM data indicated that growth duringspaceflight led to increased cell numbers compared to normal gravity, while plate counting data showed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflightand normal gravity (Figure 2). However, when the phos- phate concentration was increased from 5 to 50 mM (mAUMg-high Pi), FCM and plate counting data exhib-ited similar trends (Figure 2). In order to resolve the discrepancies between plate counting data and FCM data, we conducted additionalground-based experiments where we focused on the effects of storing cells at 8C following cell growth. Post- growth storage was targeted because bacterial storage atlow temperatures is known to affect bacterial physiology and viability 34,35. Although the FCM samples were Figure 1 Timeline of spaceflight experiments. Four days before Shuttle launch (L-4): Media were loaded into FPAs. L-3: Inocula were loaded.

BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 Page 3 of 10 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241also stored at 8C for 48 h following cell growth, we note that the paraformaldehyde fixative was added prior to lowering the incubator temperature. To test the role ofpost-growth storage conditions on cell viability, we com- pared final cell concentrations obtained when cells were plated immediately following growth, or after post-growth storage at 48 h at 8C. The same timeline and temperature profile from the spaceflight experiments (Figure 1) was followed. As shown in Figure 3, resultsfrom both plate counting and FCM showed that P. aeru- ginosa cultured in mAUMg exhibited a 7- to 9-fold de- crease in cell numbers following storage at 8C for 48 h(p 0.01, two-way ANOVA). Our results indicate that measurements of cell numbers following storage at low temperatures post-growth may not accurately representthe amount of growth that occurred in the FPAs, and differences in final cell densities observed between spaceflight samples and ground controls may be con-founded by differences in death rates. Because it is not currently feasible to plate count directly following the growth period during spaceflight, FCM measurements ofcells fixed immediately following growth provide more reliable information with respect to how much biomass was formed during the growth period. Hereafter, we willdescribe only the results obtained by FCM of samples fixed immediately after the growth period. Phosphate availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density P. aeruginosa grown in mAUM during spaceflight exhib- ited a modest, but significant, 1.5-fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls ( p0.01, one-tailed t-test) (Figure 4(a)). We also measured final celldensities in mAUM where the concentration of phosphate was increased from 5 mM, which is the concentration found in normal human urine 32, to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). In the case of mAUM-high Pi, no difference in the final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure 4(a)). In addition to phosphate, we also examined the effect of carbon source on the response of P. aeruginosa to the spaceflight environment. Changing carbon source isknown to affect P. aeruginosa metabolism and growth rate 36-38. To assess the effect of carbon source on P. aeruginosa growth during spaceflight, we substituted the 2 mM citrate found in mAUM with 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). As shown in Figure 4(a), P. aeruginosa grown in mAUMg during spaceflight showed a 4-fold increase Figure 2 Comparison of plate counting and FCM measurements of microbial growth during spaceflight. Wild-type P. aeruginosa was cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight (gray bars) conditions in mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. (a)The number of viable cells in unfixed samples was measured by plate counting. (b)The number of cells in fixed samples was measured by flow cytometry (FCM).

Figure 3 Post-growth storage of samples at 8C for 48 h decreases final cell density. Wild-type P. aeruginosa was cultured in mAUMg containing 5 mM phosphate at 37C for 72 h. Final celldensity was measured immediately following growth ( ) or following post-growth storage at 8C for 48 h () by plate counting (black bars) or FCM (gray bars). For FCM samples, fixative was added immediatelyfollowing growth ( ) or after post-growth storage at 8C for 48 h (), and cells were stored at 4C prior to staining and assessing cell numbers. Diamonds indicate results from two-way ANOVA: p0.01. Error bars, SD; N  3.Kim et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 Page 4 of 10 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p0.05, one-tailed t-test). Similar to mAUM-high Pi, no difference between final cell densities in spaceflightand normal gravity cultures was observed when the phosphate concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUMg-high Pi) (Figure 4(a)). These results show thatwhile substituting citrate with glucose does not affect the final cell density of P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight, altering phosphate concentration does affectfinal cell density ( p0.01, two-way ANOVA), and that there is an interaction between the microgravity environ- ment and phosphate concentration, as factors affectingfinal cell density, that is statistically significant ( p0.05, two-way ANOVA). This finding indicates that increasing phosphate availability can minimize the effect of space-flight on final cell density of P. aeruginosa . Oxygen availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density We hypothesized that the effects of spaceflight on final cell density might differ between anaerobic and aerobicconditions. To test this hypothesis, we substituted the solid inserts used in the experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that allow the movement of gases via a gas-permeable membrane. GE inserts have been used previously to increase the oxygen availabilityand promote aerobic growth in FPAs 13,15,17,39. Unlike cultures grown with solid inserts (Figure 4(a)), P. aeruginosa cultured in mAUM with GE inserts showed no difference in final cell density between normal gravity and spaceflight regardless of phosphate concentra- tion (Figure 4(b)). Similar results were obtained for sam-ples with GE inserts cultured in mAUMg and either 5 or 50 mM phosphate (Figure 4(b)). These results indicate that, similar to phosphate, increased oxygen availabilitycan reduce the effects of spaceflight on final cell density.Role of swimming motility on spaceflight final cell density We also examined the effects of spaceflight on a motilitymutant, motABCD, which lacks the motor proteins re- quired for flagella-mediated swimming 40. In mAUMg, motABCD cultured during spaceflight showed a 3-fold increase in final cell density compared to its normalgravity counterpart ( p 0.05, one-tailed t-test), while in mAUMg-high Pi there was no difference in final cell density (Figure 4(a)). We also cultured motABCD with GE inserts and observed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity controls, regardless of phosphate availability (Figure 4(b)). Overall,we did not observe any significant differences between the final cell density of wild-type P. aeruginosa and the non-motile mutant under any of our experimental con-ditions ( p0.05, three-way ANOVA; factors: gravity, phosphate, motility). Microscopy of planktonic cells does not show aggregation of P. aeruginosa PA14 Increases in aggregation and clumping of planktonic cells have been observed for Salmonella grown during spaceflight 13 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in LSMMG 41. To assess whether spaceflight conditionsinduced cellular aggregation in our spaceflight experi- ments, we observed the fixed P. aeruginosa PA14 plank- tonic cells by differential interference contrast (DIC)microscopy. Interestingly, no clumps or aggregates with more than 3 cells were observed following growth in mAUM with 5 or 50 mM phosphate during spaceflightor on Earth (Figure 5), or under any of the other media conditions tested (data not shown). Discussion We have shown that, within the constraints of our spaceflight experiments, FCM of fixed cells provides Figure 4 Effect of spaceflight on final cell density of P. aeruginosa .Wild-type P. aeruginosa and a motility mutant ( motABCD) were cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight conditions (gray bars) in FPAs with (a)solid inserts or (b)GE inserts. Cells were cultured in mAUM or mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. F inal cell density was measured by FCM. Effect of phosphate on final cell density is significant in FPAs with solid inse rts two-way ANOVA, p 0.01. Effect of gravity on final cell density is significant in 5 mM phosphate conditions in FPAs with solid inserts two-way ANOVA, p 0.01. Statistical differences between spaceflight and nor mal gravity for each experimental condition was analyzed by one-tailed t-test:  p 0.01;  p 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N  3.Kim et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 Page 5 of 10 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241more reliable measurements of final cell numbers of planktonic cells grown in FPAs during spaceflight and on Earth. Although fixing the cells prevents one fromdistinguishing between live and dead populations, the ef- fects of post-growth storage at 8C on cell viability indi- cate that the viability of cells during post-growth storageshould be assessed on Earth prior to spaceflight studies, and suggest that the use of viable cell measurements should be avoided when possible. Further, a recent studyhas shown that changes in growth rate that occur when Micrococcus luteus is cultured in simulated microgravity conditions can be lost within 7 h of exposure to normalgravity 42. Changes in resistance to oxidative stress were similarly lost within 2 h after Staphylococcus aur- euscells were removed from LSMMG conditions 43. Of course, for certain spaceflight studies, such as those assessing changes in virulence or antibiotic resistance,the use of viable cells is essential. Interestingly, the observa- tion that Salmonella virulence is increased following growth during spaceflight 13, which has been confirmedby both additional spaceflight a nd simulated microgravity experiments 15, indicates that at least some of the physio- logical changes that occur during spaceflight are main-tained when the samples are returned to Earth and assayed or used immediately. In the Salmonella virulence studies, Wilson and co-workers sto red cells in fresh media at ambient temperature follow ing growth during spaceflight13,15. In our experiments we did not use this approach in order to avoid increases in cell number due to the additional media. Together th ese results highlight the care- ful, nuanced approach that must be taken in order to con- duct spaceflight experiments that provide results that truly reflect how the cells grow and adapt to the spaceflightenvironment. We have systematically studied the effects of space- flight on the final cell density of P. aeruginosa, assessing factors known to affect bacterial growth such as phos- phate and oxygen availability, carbon source and motil- ity. We have demonstrated that differences between finalcell density of P. aeruginosa cultured during spaceflight and on Earth are dependent on nutrient and oxygen availability. Specifically, spaceflight increased the final cell density of P. aeruginosa when it was grown with low phos- phate and low oxygen availability. When either phosphateor oxygen availability was increased, no difference between normal gravity and spaceflight was observed. Similar to previous observations that increasing phos- phate concentration or supplementing media with the inorganic ion components of M9 media, which includes phosphate, can minimize the effects of spaceflight orLSMMG on virulence and acid tolerance of Salmonella 15, we observed that increasing the phosphate concen- tration from 5 to 50 mM in the artificial urine media mini-mized the differences between spaceflight and normal Figure 5 Absence of aggregation by planktonic cells grown in FPAs.

BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 Page 6 of 10 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241gravity final cell densities of P. aeruginosa .B e r r y et al. , have also shown that phosphate uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased when cultured during spaceflight 44 . Taken together, these findings may indicate that phosphate plays a key role in microbial responses to spaceflight conditions. However, additional studies are needed to de-termine whether phosphate is acting simply as a growth- limiting nutrient, or if the effect is more specific. While cells grown with 5 mM phosphate are not likely to bestarved for this essential nutrient, increasing phosphate concentration has been shown to increase the growth rate ofP. aeruginosa 45. We also observed that using GE inserts minimized differences between final cell concentra- tions following growth under normal and microgravity. Similarly, Wilson et al. , did not observe any difference in final cell concentration between spaceflight and normal gravity when Salmonella was cultured in FPAs with GE inserts, as measured by FCM 13,15,17. While we ob-served that the use of GE inserts was advantageous for bacteria grown in normal gravity, no additional increases were observed for spaceflight cultures when the solid in-serts were replaced with the GE inserts. This may be at- tributed to a lower oxygen transfer rate in microgravity, as described previously for LSMMG 16. Indeed, studies ofP. aeruginosa PAO1 gene expression have indicated that growth in FPAs is likely microaerophilic or anaerobic even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradi-ents within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions 17. We have recently ob- served that the use of GE inserts also minimized differ-ences in P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm growth between normal and spaceflight conditions 24. In that case, we did see increases in biofilm biomass in spaceflight sampleswith GE inserts. However, the proximity of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts ensured that any additional oxygen was delivered directly to the growing biofilm cells.Overall, these findings highlight the role that environmen- tal conditions and nutrient availability have on modulating how microbes respond to the spaceflight environment. While motile bacteria have been predicted to be less affected by the indirect effects of gravity on Earth, such as cell settling, due to their ability to self-propel 14, we did not observe any difference between the final cell densities of motile and non-motile P. aeruginosa . This is likely due to the fact that even motile P. aeruginosa do not swim constantly .Indeed, bacterial motility has been shown to vary during growth 46, where the proportionof cells actively swimming decrease as bacteria approach stationary phase 47. As such, the difference between our results and earlier experiments with E. coli 9 may be attributed to differences in the regulation of swim- ming motility between the two organisms under the conditions tested. Together, this suggests that while aconstantly swimming population of cells may mitigatethe role of gravity, the regulation of motility can lead even cells that are capable of swimming motility to be affected by gravity and to exploit the advantages of themicrogravity environment. Unlike P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultured under LSMMG, P. aeruginosa PA14 cultured during spaceflight did not form cellular aggregates in planktonic cultures. This ob- servation is likely due to differences in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are responsible for cellu-lar aggregation 48. Production of EPS in P. aeruginosa is known to be modulated by various environmental factors, including shear stress 49. The difference between theLSMMG results and our spaceflight results may be due to the fact that the spaceflight environment has far lower shear than LSMMG 17. It may also be due to differencesin EPS composition between P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14, where P. aeruginosa PA14 has Pel as a primary polysaccharide, P. aeruginosa PAO1 has Psl 50. Because similar aggregation has been observed with Salmonella grown during spaceflight 13 and S. aureus grown in LSMMG 43, further studies of how shear, nutrient avail-ability and genetics affect this behavior may provide add- itional insights into how different microbes respond to the spaceflight environment. Conclusions Our findings indicate that differences in P. aeruginosa final cell densities observed between spaceflight and nor- mal gravity are due to an interplay between changes in mixing and transport that occur under microgravity con-ditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. These results may improve our ability to predict how different microbes will respond to microgravity andhow combinations of environmental and genetic factors affect important behaviors, such as growth and viru- lence, both during spaceflight and on Earth. Here, wehave shown that the microgravity environment encoun- tered during spaceflight appears to allow cells to grow better with limited resources when compared to similarconditions on Earth. Considering the majority of bac- teria, including those that are found on spacecrafts and space stations, live in nutrient-limited environments, thisfinding highlights the need for ongoing studies of how these effects may affect crew health during long-term spaceflight. Methods Bacterial strains and culture media Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 23 and its isogenic mo- tility mutant, motABCD 40, were used for the current experiment. All strains were grown overnight at 37C withshaking at 225 rpm in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentrationKim et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 Page 7 of 10 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241of 6 x 106CFUmL. The modified artificial urine medium (mAUM) used in the present study is based on the medium previously described by Brooks et al., 31. To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50x; Sigma, cat : R7131) and L-glutamine solution (200 mM; Sigma, cat : G7513) weresubstituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentra- tion of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to minimize precipitation duringstorage at 8C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable some growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Higher concentrationsof sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. To test the effects of carbonsource, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). To assess the role of phosphate availability, we used either 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate, where mAUMand mAUMg include 5 mM phosphate and mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi contain 50 mM phosphate. The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0. Spaceflight and ground control cultures Spaceflight and ground control cultures of P. aeruginosa were prepared and grown in a fluid processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously 24. To load the FPA, a 13-mm diameter mixed cellulose ester membrane disc(Millipore) was first attached to a solid or a gas ex- change (GE) insert with autoclavable double-sided tape (3 M). Next, 2.5 mL of media and 0.5 mL of inoculumwere sequentially loaded into two compartments sepa- rated by a rubber stopper. Due to constraints imposed by the dimensions of the bevel, approximately 0.6 mL ofair remained in the compartment containing the media after loading. A third compartment, for FCM samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9 wv paraformaldehydein PBS. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. Eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP), which enablessimultaneous plunging of the rubber stoppers in each FPA, and were incubated in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) as described previ-ously 30. Cultures were grown following the experi- ment timeline shown in Figure 1. Before shuttle launch, all FPAs were loaded and stored at ambient temperaturefor at least 48 h to check for contamination. Samples were subsequently stored at 8C (L-1) until activation. Five days before shuttle landing, the media and ino-culum were combined and incubated at 37C for 72 h (activation). Two days before shuttle landing, the tem- perature was decreased to 8C and the FCM sampleswere fixed with paraformaldehyde (termination). Sam- ples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle land- ing and processed immediately. Ground controls wereconducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. The attached membranes were separated from the liquid phase, planktonic fractions.Characterization and analysis of biofilm growth on the membranes have been reported separately 24. Plate counting One mL of the planktonic fraction was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8 min to disperse anyclumps of cells. The planktonic fraction was serially di- luted with PBS. Samples were spot-plated on NB agar and incubated at 37C for 18 h prior to counting. Sample preparation and flow cytometric analysis Bacterial cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were washedwith PBS and stained with 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies) for 2 h at room temperature ac- cording to the manufacturer s instructions. Stained sam- ples were diluted to approximately 5 x 10 59x1 06CFU mL with PBS. Cell numbers were measured using a FAC- SAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a407 nm laser. To calculate the concentration of cells from FCM recorded events, liquid counting beads (BD Biosci- ences) were used following the manufacturer s instruction. Briefly, 50 L of the liquid counting beads was added to 1 mL of each diluted sample. The beads were detected by FCM in a separate region that does not overlap with thecells. The number of events in the cell region was re- corded until one thousand events in the bead region were detected. The concentration of cells in each sample wascalculated using the following equation. Conc :of cells of events in cell region of events in bead region xof beads test test volumexdilution factor Effects of post-growth storage on viable cell counts and FCM data The experiments were performed using FPAs following the same timeline and temperature profile as described inFigure 1. FPAs were incubated at 37C for 72 h. Samples were either processed immediately or stored at 8C for 48 h. To process samples, 1 mL of culture was enumer-ated by plate counting and a second 1 mL fraction was fixed with paraformaldehyde and enumerated by FCM.

Statistical compari-son of the number of cells between normal gravity and spaceflight for each different condition was conducted using a one-tailed Student s t-test. When assessing com- binations of two factors (post-growth storage and the microgravity environment, or phosphate concentration in media and microgravity) or three factors (motility,phosphate concentration in media, and microgravity), the effects of each factor and their interaction were assessed by two or three-way ANOVA with post-hocTukey tests using PASW Statistics18 (SPSS Inc.). Statis- tical significance was defined as p 0.05. Additional file Additional file 1: Figure S1. Illustration of fluid processing apparatus (FPA).

        "conclusion": "s: These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on E arth. Considering that the maj ority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings hig hlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.

BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241Background Bacteria can sense changes in their surroundings and modulate their gene expression and physiology to adaptto a range of environmental conditions. A unique con- dition that bacteria encounter during spaceflight is sig- nificantly reduced gravity, known as microgravity 1,2.Many studies have shown that the microgravity environ- ment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial physiology, including increased growth rate, antibioticresistance, and virulence 3. The effects of microgravity on final cell density have been described for several bac- terial species, including Escherichia coli 4-9, Bacillus subtilis 10,11, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi- murium (hereafter referred to as Salmonella ) 12,13. A number of these studies have shown increased final celldensity during spaceflight, while others have not observed significant differences between spaceflight and normal gravity conditions 14. Interestingly, independent studiesof the same species have also yielded differing results, where some examining E. coli during spaceflight have reported increased final cell density 5,8, and others havereported no differences relative to normal gravity controls 4,6. Some studies have been repeated on multiple shuttle missions and yielded consistent results 13,15, suggestingthat these differences are likely not due to issues with experimental design or reproducibility. As such, we hypo- thesize that these discrepancies may be attributed to dif-ferences in media and culture conditions, in addition to differences in how individual species respond to the microgravity environment. Benoit and Klaus have suggested that differences in motility may be responsible for some of these inconsist- ent observations 14. They hypothesize non-motile bac-teria have an advantage under spaceflight conditions due to a lack of cell settling and the resulting increases in local nutrient availability in the well-mixed environment,while motile cells are able to move actively towards nu- trients under both normal and microgravity conditions 14. Indeed, a previous spaceflight experiment, con-ducted by Thvenet et al., found that growth in micro- gravity increased the final cell density of a non-motile E. coli mutant lacking motB relative to normal gravity, while no differences were observed with the motile par- ent 9. However, further studies are needed to examinewhether motility plays a universal role in affecting mi- crobial growth in microgravity. Recent studies have also indicated that media conditions can modulate how microgravity affects bacterial physiology 15-17. Salmonella cultured in Lennox broth (LB) during spaceflight exhibited increased virulence in a murine modelof infection compared to controls where Salmonella was grown on Earth. However, the use of M9 media or the addition of the inorganic ion components of M9 to LB wasobserved to mitigate the enhanced virulence of Salmonellainduced during spaceflight 15 . A set of follow-up experi- ments tested the individual components of M9 and showed that the addition of phosphate alone to LBcould prevent the increase in acid tolerance observed when Salmonella is grown in low shear modeled micro- gravity (LSMMG) 15. In addition to phosphate, oxygen availability may also influence how bacteria grow and respond to the spa- ceflight environment. For example, oxygen is known toaffect many aspects of the growth and physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a facultative anaerobe, includ- ing growth, motility, and biofilm formation 18-20.P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and was attributed to the spaceflight infection of an astro- naut during Apollo 13 21,22. We recently examinedbiofilm formation by P. aeruginosa PA14, a virulent clinical isolate 23, and shown that differences in bio- film biomass observed between spaceflight and normalgravity can be minimized when oxygen availability is in- creased 24. Modeling efforts have suggested that oxy- gen transfer rates may be decreased under LSMMGconditions compared to normal gravity conditions 16, and a number of genes involved in anaerobic metabol- ism were found to be up-regulated when P. aeruginosa PAO1, a less virulent laboratory reference strain 25,26, was grown during spaceflight 17. These findings indi- cate that oxygen availability may influence bacterial re-sponses to spaceflight, and highlight the interplay between changes in the environment due to the direct or indirect effects of microgravity, such as reduced oxy-gen transport, and changes in microbial physiology. However, previous studies have not examined changes in the response of planktonic cells to the spaceflight en-v i r o n m e n tw h e no x y g e na v a i l a b i l i t yi sv a r i e d . The methods used to investigate microbial growth during spaceflight may also be responsible for some ofthe differences. To date, the measurement of bacterial cell density has most often been conducted after samples were returned to Earth due to constraints imposed bythe nature of such spaceflight experiments 27. The two methods of storing planktonic samples of bacteria grown during spaceflight prior to analysis used most frequently are the addition of a fixative to the culture 6,9,28 and the storage of live samples at low temperatures 4,5. Inthe present study, we assess the use of two methods for measuring microbial cell concentrations following growth during spaceflight: plate counting of live samples and flow cytometry (FCM) of fixed samples. Plate count- ing has the advantage of allowing the measurement of viable cell numbers. FCM is a fast and precise methodto count cells 29. Furthermore, this method is able to directly count hundreds of thousands of cells in a single sample, thereby facilitating the generation of statisticallymeaningful results.Kim et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:241 Page 2 of 10 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-218013241We have investigated the effects of phosphate concen- tration, carbon source, oxygen availability and swimming motility on the final cell density of P. aeruginosa PA14 grown during spaceflight. Here, we demonstrate that the final cell density of P. aeruginosa is increased during spaceflight when culture conditions limit the availabilityof substrates required for growth. Specifically, growth during spaceflight led to an increase in final cell density when P. aeruginosa was cultured under low phosphate and low oxygen conditions. Increased availability of either phosphate or oxygen was observed to minimize the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density. Thesefindings indicate that effects of gravity on final cell dens- ity can be modulated by the availability of growth- limiting substrates.",
