Introduction Most multicellular organisms have specialized or- gans, structures, cells, and signaling pathways dedi- cated to sensing their environment, such as the gravity-sensingcolumella cells found in the plant root tip (Sato et al., 2015). However, the ability to sense and physiologically adapt to a new environment is not limited to organisms with specialized cellsand organs; undifferentiated plant cells lacking specialization engage a complex response when exposed to an environment without gravity (Paul et al., 2012). Yet the fundamental ques- tion of how an undifferentiated cell senses gravity remainsunanswered. Microgravity experimentation, enabled by the International Space Station (ISS), can essentially remove the effects of this ubiquitous force that affects all life on Earth andprovide unique experimental information about gravity-sensingmechanisms and gravity-based processes, while also describing the physiological changes needed to survive in spaceight (Reaet al., 2016; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Understanding the events of physiological adaptation in undifferentiated cells in spaceight advances fundamental knowledge about how cellsrecognize the gravity stimulus and provides insight as to how gravity-associated signal transduction occurs within a single cell. Both types of insight enhance our ability to prepare forlong-term space exploration. Even though undifferentiated cells and single-celled or- ganisms lack specialized organs for gravity sensing, they areindeed able to detect changes in gravity and are affected by thespaceight environment. In the microgravity of spaceight, cells adapt by making changes to their metabolism that are guided by, and reected in, differential gene expression whencompared to living on the ground (Salmi and Roux, 2008; Paul 1Horticultural Science Department, Program in Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. 2Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. 3Present address: Moftt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.ASTROBIOLOGY Volume 17, Number 11, 2017Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089ast.2016.1538 1077et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Further, undifferentiated cells survive and multiply in space, implying that cells manage to reestablish a favorable physiological equilibrium in micro-gravity (Paul et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Individual cells can sense and respond to changes in their gravity environment, but the mechanism by which these signals are received and then transduced is poorly understood. Our work with the re-sponse of plants and undifferentiated cell cultures to space- ight revealed a number of potential molecular constituents that may be involved in gravisensing and adaptation tospaceight environments. The approach in the present study was to examine patterns of gene expression in undifferentiated cell lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) developed from wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and from Col-0 plantsdecient in a known gravity-sensing gene: Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1 ). Several reasons contributed to the selection of Arg1 for closer study. Central to the decision was the evidence that Arg1 functions in the early events in gravitropic signal transduction in plant roots (Sedbrook et al., 1998; Blancaor, 2013). During root gravistimulation, ARG1 helps guide the relocalization of membrane-bound auxin efux carrier pro- teinssuch as PIN2 and PIN3to the basal side of the sta-tocytes, which contributes to the establishment of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root cap (Abas et al., 2006; Harrison and Masson, 2008b; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). Although this process has not been demonstrated in non-statocyte cells, ARG1 seems to be well positioned for a role in response to gravity in undifferentiated cells as well. Sev- eral additional characteristics made Arg1 a particularly in- teresting subject with regard to undifferentiated cells. Arg1 is expressed throughout the entire plant; it is not a root-specic gene. Further, ARG1 is not localized to plastids and does notappear to be dependent on mechanisms related to amyloplast movement in specialized cells, such as is typied by PGM, another protein linked to gravitropism (Guan et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009; Morita and Nakamura, 2012). Since specialized cells are absent in the cell cultures, the apparent ability of ARG1 to contribute to gravity sensing without these specializations reinforced its candidacy. In addition, ARG1 islocalized throughout the endosomalsecretory pathway, en- abling it to interact with both vesicular trafcking and inte- gral membrane proteins (Boonsirichai et al., 2003). ARG1 localization cycles along the endomembrane system between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009); thus ARG1 could play a role in gravisensing based on its association with internal cellular structures in the undifferentiated cells. The highly conserved Jdomain at ARG1s N-terminus, a structural hallmark of proteins involved in stress response and signaltransduction (Caplan et al., 1993; Kimura et al., 1995), also supports a gravisignaling role for ARG1 in the cell. The J- domain proteins typically function as molecular co-chaperonesby interacting with HSC70 (Young et al., 2003), and the ARG1HSC70 connection has been made in the TOC complex on the outer chloroplast membrane, where it plays a role inprotein transfer (Jouhet and Gray, 2009; Su and Li, 2010). HSC70 isoform HSP70 is induced by spaceight in several plant systems (reviewed in Schu leret al., 2015), including undifferentiated cells (Paul et al., 2012; Zupanska et al., 2013), strengthening the connection of HSC70 chaperones with gravity sensing and signal transduction. In addition to a Jdo-main, ARG1 also contains a coiled-coil region in its C-terminus that likely enhances its ability to interact with actin in the cytoskeleton (Sedbrook et al., 1999; Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Harrison and Masson, 2008a). The cytoskeleton is central tomany models of single-cell gravity sensing (Ingber, 1999; Vorselen et al., 2014), and actin has been specically impli- cated in gravisensing (Kamada et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2015). Thus ARG1s extensive role in targeted protein distribution, signal transduction, and interaction with cytoskeleton makes it a strong candidate for a role in gravity responses in undiffer-entiated cells. Cell lines from wild-type (WT) Col-0 and an ARG1 knock-out (ARG1 KO) in the same Col-0 background werelaunched to the ISS for the CEL experiment, which was acomponent of the Biological Research In Canisters-17 (BRIC-17) payload. The experiments described here com- pare samples xed in orbit after growth in space to com-parable samples grown in precisely the same hardware on the ground. The focus of the experiment was to evaluate the overall effect of the spaceight environment on these cells. The objective of these experiments was to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of undifferentiated cells to the spaceight environment and, in particular, testthe effect of removing Arg1 , a gene we hypothesized would be a gene of importance to the adaptive process. The utili- zation of this mutant also revealed genes important tospaceight adaptation that would not normally be recog-nized, as they are not differentially regulated by spaceight in WT cells. In the case of these genes, the level at which they are expressed on the ground in WT cells is the levelthat is also required in the physiological adaptation to spaceight, so no differential expression is seen between ground and spaceight in WT cells. However, if the ex-pression levels on the ground are altered for these genes, as can be found in a mutant cell line such as ARG1 KO, then the expression levels must be adjusted to the normal WTlevels to enable spaceight adaptation. Thus the alteredexpression level of these genes is irrelevant for the ground adaptation but is important for the spaceight adaptation. The results of the spaceight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding of ARG1s role in adjusting to this novel environment and have also enabled us to look further into the adaptive process engaged by cells lacking specic, differ-entiated cells and organs for environmental sensing. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Concept of operations and comparison approach When a cell transitions from Earth to orbit, it responds and begins to adjust its metabolism to the stimuli offered bythe new environment. In this experiment, the patterns of gene expression established after 10 days of growth in the BRIC hardware were used to illuminate the strategies un-differentiated cells used to physiologically adapt to the spaceight environment. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part approach. First, differentiallyexpressed genes were identied between cells grown in the two environments: spaceight and the comparable ground controls. The genes identied in this vertical comparisonreected physiological adaptation to the spaceight environ- ment within each genotype. Second, differentially expressed genes were identied between wild-type (WT) and arg11078 ZUPANSKA ET AL.mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes. The genes identied in this horizontal genotype comparison showed the impact of removing ARG1 from metabolic processes in both the normalground control environment as well as in the spaceight en-vironment. Comparing gene expression patterns revealed potential roles for ARG1 in both environments. An overview is shown in Fig. 1 and details of the approach provided below. This rst analytical approach involves the typical com- parison of the gene expression proles of spaceight-grown cells to the ground controls for each of the two cell lines,thereby characterizing the physiological adaptation of each genotype to spaceight (red box in Fig. 1A and red arrows in 1B). Genes identied in WT cells contribute to understandingwhich cellular processes were sensitive to microgravity andspaceight. If physiological adaptation to spaceight depends entirely on functional Arg1 , then the ARG1 KO cell line would be in severe decline, and the spaceight-to-groundgene expression proles would reect that stress. If ARG1 is not involved in physiological adaptation to spaceight, then the spaceight-to-ground gene expression proles fromARG1 KO cells would be largely the same as WT. However if ARG1 functions simply as part of the pathways engaged by spaceight, then the pattern of genes differentially expressedto adapt to spaceight will differ between WT and the knock- out cell line but retain some degree of overlap. The second analytical approach involves the comparison of gene expression proles between WT and ARG1 KO cellsboth on the ground and during spaceight (green and blue box of Fig. 1A and green and blue arrows of 1B). This approach reveals gene expression differences in the cells adapted toeither environment with a disabled Arg1 gene. Since ARG1 has a role in typical cell maintenance, it was likely that thegene expression proles of ARG1 KO cell culture would differ from WT in the ground environment, as a knock-out cell line would adapt its metabolism to compensate for the absence ofthe important gene. Since the gene expression patterns on theground will likely affect the nature of adaptation to spaceight, it is important to compare the gene expression proles between the two genotypes of the ground controls (green box of Fig. 1Aand green arrows of 1B). Finally, every individual gene engaged in the WT phys- iological adaptation to spaceight experiment was examinedin the ARG1 KO cells to determine whether the gene was similarly expressed or changed in the knock-out line. If a gene was changed in the same way in both genotypes, thenwe concluded it was Arg1 independent. However, if a gene was not engaged in the ARG1 KO cells, or was engaged in a different manner than in the WT cells, then the expression of that gene in the WT adaptation to spaceight was deter-mined to be dependent upon ARG1 function. 2.1.1. The CEL experiment of BRIC-17. The CEL ex- periment setup and organization was a modication of a pre- vious Arabidopsis cell culture experiment in BRIC-16 (Paul et al., 2012). The CEL BRIC-17 experiment was launched on board the Dragon capsule of the SpaceX-2 Commercial Re- supply Service (CRS) mission to the ISS on 1 March 2013. The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceightsamples) were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri DishFixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the BRIC hardware. The BRIC hardware remains stationary after it is de- stowed from the Dragon Capsule and deployed to the ISS. TheBRIC hardware does not have a centrifuge component, nor is it compatible with the limited centrifuge facilities on the ISS, ARG1 KO WTDataset: SPACE- FLIGHT ARG1 KO WTFLT ARG1 KO F : FArg WtFLT WT GC ARG1 KO GC WT G : GArg WtF : GArg ArgF : GWt WtGENES EXPRESSION BETWEEN GENOTYPES WITHIN SPACEFLIGHT GENES EXPRESSION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN GENOTYPE GENES EXPRESSION BETWEEN GENOTYPES WITHIN GROUNDenvironments Dataset: GROUND CONTROL environments genotypes genotypesAB FIG. 1.

Additional hardware details and BRIC illustrations can be found in Paul et al. (2012). The experiment made a direct comparison of spaceight-grown cells to those grown ascontrols on the ground for the purpose of exploring the com- plete range of effects that spaceight presents to plant cells, which includes but is not limited to the effects of microgravity. Two BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC-17 payload. Each chamber housed ve PDFUs, each PDFU holding one 60 mm Petri plate. In eachBRIC container there were two plates with WT cells and three plates with knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRIC containers onthe ground in the International Space Station EnvironmentalSimulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as ground controls. The ground controls were initiated with a 48 h delay so that the precise temperature environment ofthe ISS could be recreated for the ground controls in the ISSES chamber. Cells were xed on the ISS with RNAlater C212 (Ambion) on the 10 thday on orbit, and the ground controls were xed 48 h later. RNAlater xation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri plate. Twenty fourhours after xation, the entire BRIC was moved to the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), where it resided until cold stowage transport back to Earth within theDragon capsule. After returning to Earth, the samples werereclaimed at KSC and then transported to the University of Florida laboratories. As described below, the total RNA was extracted from spaceight samples and corresponding groundcontrol samples and subjected to microarrays. Although the BRIC hardware has virtually no air circulation, no gas ex- change, and no light, that hardware conguration is not sub-stantially different from the normal growing conditions of the undifferentiated tissue culture cells, which are typically grown in sealed Petri plates in the dark (Johnson et al., 2015). 2.2. Tissue culture cell lines Arabidopsis callus cultures were established de novo from well-established plant lines available through The Arabi- dopsis Information Resource (TAIR, www.arabidopsis.org) and are indicated below. Each cell line was initiated si-multaneously approximately 6 months before launch. Cells derived from hypocotyls were grown and maintained on plates with solid media containing MS salts (4.33 gL), 3sucrose (30 gL), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000 solution), 2,4-D (0.3 mLL), 0.5 agar (5 gL) and kinetin (0.2 mgL) until dedifferentiated into callus. The callus cells were thentransferred to the standard liquid media containing MS salts(4.33 gL), 3 sucrose (30 gL), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000 solution) and 2,4-D (0.5 mLL) and maintained in a sterile continuous cell suspension culture. Two cell lineseach of Col-0 ecotype were the subject of this study: WT andarg1, the latter being a knock-out line generated from theARG1 T-DNA insertion (SALK_024542C). The arg1 cell line is referred to as ARG1 KO throughout. The SALK line was obtained through TAIR. The SALK mutant line (arg1-3 ) is characterized by a T-DNA insertion at position 952 (in an intron). Although the mutated gene can produce a truncated transcript, it is not functional, and arg1-3 is con- sidered a null allele (Gleeson et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013).2.3. Preparation of BRIC-17 CEL cell culture plates Liquid suspension cells growing in log phase were trans- ferred to solid media two and a half days prior to turning over the payload in preparation for launch. The liquid media was decanted, the material washed once with fresh liquid media,and then the sample was decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes,USA) that contained 6.5 mL nutrient agar media MS salts(4.33 gL), 3 sucrose (30 gL), MS vitamins, 2,4-D MES buffer (0.5 gL), 0.8 agar (8 gL). The cells were then dis- persed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulationswere conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar ow hood to ensure sterility of both the interior and exterior of the plates. Plates were put into a sterile Nalgene C212BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientic), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-Wrap C212autoclave wraps (Fisher), and then driven to KSC. The BRIC-17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) atKSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time. 2.4. RNA extractions Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy C212kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion usingan RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 2.5. Microarrays cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies, Inc.), and cDNA was labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies, Inc.). Am- plied and labeled cDNA (5 mgsample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabi- dopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 C176C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) with theHybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and theWashing Procedure FS450_0004. Scanning was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. For both spaceight and ground control, ve plates of WT and fourplates of ARG1 KO were analyzed as biological replicates. 2.5.1. Microarrays data analysis. Affymetrix Expres- sion Console Software (Version 1.3) was used to generate .CEL les for each RNA hybridization. All analysis was performed in R 3.0.0 and Bioconductor version 2.12 (RDevelopment Core Team, 2012). Background adjustment, summarization, and quantile normalization were performed using Limma package (Smyth, 2004). Normalization wasmade using the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 normalization algorithm(Hubbell et al., 2002). Data quality was assessed using the arrayQualityMetrics package and various QC charts (Density  Intensity plot, NUSE, RLE, and RNA Degradation Plot).Probes that had absent signals in all samples were removed. For each replicate array, each probe-set signal value from spaceight samples was compared to the probe-set signal1080 ZUPANSKA ET AL.value of ground control samples to give gene expression ra- tios. Differentially expressed genes were identied using the Limma package with a Benjamini and Hochberg false dis-covery rate multiple testing correction. Genes were consid-ered as differentially expressed with stringent criteria at p value 0.01, abs Fold Change 2(-1FC log2 1; labeled as log2 Fold Change) unless stated otherwise. The microarray data are publicly available from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of the National Center for Bio- technology Information (NCBI) data repository under ac-cession number GSE81442. 2.5.2. Comparison groups. The groups outlined in the concept of operations and comparisons were established andabbreviated with combination of two capital letters and a short version of the cell line name in superscript (Fig. 1B). Letters are as follows: G for ground control, F for spaceight;superscripts are Wt for WT cells, Arg for ARG1 KO cells. 2.6. Functional gene categorization, Gene Ontology annotations Gene function was annotated by associations of controlled vocabularies or keywords to data objects (Gene Ontology, GO). Multiple GO toolkits of this controlled vocabulary system were used to collect annotations of gene function.Various lists of gene names were created, and enrichment GOterms were searched after statistical tests from precalculated backgrounds. All three aspects of gene products (molecular function, biological process, and subcellular location) de-scribed by GO-controlled vocabularies were considered. A signicance level of 0.05 and ve genes as minimum number of mapping entries were implemented for the analysis pa-rameters in the following tools. AgriGO : An integrated web-based GO analysis toolkit for the agricultural community AgriGO was used (Du et al., 2010). AgriGO query criteria were as follows: Singular En-richment Analysis (SEA), Arabidopsis gene model (TAIR9) precomputed background, Fisher was selected as a statistical test method of choice with NOT-adjust multi-test adjustmentmethod, Signicance level was set at 0.01 or 0.05, Minimum number of mapping of entries was set at ve, Plant GO slim was selected from other GO types. The Benjamini-Hochbergadjusted pvalue (FDR) was calculated manually using R function on the signicant GO terms. For Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (PAGE), selected species was Ara- bidopsis thaliana , NOT-adjust was selected for multitest adjustment method, signicance level was set at 0.05, Mini- mum number of mapping of entries was set at 10, and PlantGO slim was selected from other GO types. AmiGO: If needed, the GO database was accessed through the AmiGO query tool. ATTED-II: ATTED-II database of coexpressed genes developed to identify functionally related genes in Arabi- dopsis was also used (Obayashi et al., 2009). Making gene function table function was implemented to retrieve orga-nized information on gene function (based on TAIR anno- tation) and subcellular localization (as predicted by TargetP and WOLF PSORT). gProler: A web-based toolset for functional proling of gene lists was used. Arabidopsis thaliana was a selected organism with most of the default options except theBenjamini-Hochberg FDR signicance threshold was se- lected (Reimand et al., 2007). 2.7. Real quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR The total RNA (850 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). One-tenth oftotal cDNA was used as a template for a single RT-qPCR run. RT-qPCR was carried out using TaqMan C212technology on the ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Applied Biosystems,Foster City, CA, USA). The TaqMan C212Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) reagent was used for the duplex RT-qPCR reaction with6FAM and VIC-dye labeled, TAMRA-quenched probes. Inall reactions the Ubq11 (At4g05050) served as an internal control. Each duplex PCR mixture contained 900 n Mtarget gene-specic forward and reverse primers each, 150 n M Ubq11 forward and reverse primers each, 250 n M6FAM labeled target gene-specic probe, and 250 n MVIC-labeled Ubq11 probe. Primers and probes were designed with Pri-mer Express software and supplied by Applied Biosystems. The primersprobes sequences shown as 5 3were as follows: Ubq11 (At4g05050) forward: AACTTGAGGA CGGCAGAACTTT, reverse: GTGATGGTCTTTCCGGTCAAA3, probe: VIC-CAGAAGGAGTCTACGCTTCATTT GGTCTTGC-TAMRA; Agp12 (At3g13520) forward: TCT CCGCCGTAGGAAACGT, reverse: AGCATCGGAAGTAGGACTTGGA, probe: 6FAM-CTGCGCAGACAGAG GCTCCGG-TAMRA; Skb1 (At4g31120) forward: TGA TACCTCAGAGGGACTGAATGAT, reverse: GCTTACTGTCATGCTCACAAAGAAG, probe: 6FAM-CCTGGGA GCTGTGGAATTCGTTTCG-TAMRA; HsfA2 (At2g26150) forward: GGTGTGCTTGTAGCTGAGGTAGTTAG, re-verse: TGCTCCATAGCTGCAACTTGA, probe: 6FAM- TTGAGGCAACAGCAACACAGCTCCA-TAMRA. Real quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction was performed as reported previously. Briey, thethermal cycling program consisted of 20 s at 95 C176C, followed by 40 cycles of 3 s at 95 C176C, and 30 s at 59 C176C. Reactions were quantied by threshold cycle, Ct. Primers and probe setswere rst subjected to validation experiments to test the efciency of the target and reference amplications. The Ct values for respective number of biological replicas of eachexperimental group (treated, control) were analyzed using 7500 Software v2.0.5 along with Microsoft Excel and the comparative CT( DDCT) method. The DCt was calculated as the difference between the threshold cycle value of a target gene and that of Ubq11 (endogenous control) in the same sample, while DDCt was calculated as the difference between theDCt value of a treated sample and that of the control (calibrator). The fold difference of the target gene expression in treated samples relative to control samples (calibrator) was calculated as 2( DDCt) and then log2-transformed. 3. Results Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, differentially ex-pressed genes were identied between the two environ- ments: spaceight cells and comparable ground controls, which reected the physio logical adaptation to theARG1 IN SPACEFLIGHT ADAPTATION 1081spaceight environment. Second, differentially expressed genes were identied between the two genotypes: WT and ARG1 KO cells, which provide a comparison of cell re-sponses in spaceight and on the ground. Figure 1A and 1Billustrates the matrix that was used to compare the two ge- notypes and two environmental conditions of this experi- ment: Ground Control WT ( G Wt), Ground Control ARG1 KO ( GArg), Spaceight WT ( FWt), and Spaceight ARG1 KO ( FArg). The specics of each comparison follow. 3.1. The Arg1 expression across samples The Arg1 transcript level in the ARG1 KO cells is sub- stantially lower (6.4-fold) than in WT cells; however, thisdifference did not register as statistically signicant. The average raw transcript of the Arg1 gene in the four biolog- ical replicates of the WT ground control cells is 307,whereas the average raw Arg1 transcript in the three bio- logical replicas of the ARG1 KO ground control cells is 48. The value from the ARG1 KO cells was derived from threereplicate values that were sufciently dissimilar (80, 11, 53) as to be scored as not statistically valid. There was virtually no difference in Arg1 transcript levels between the ground and the spaceight samples in eitherWT cells or ARG1 KO cells. The average raw transcript level of Arg1 in the four biological replicas of the WT spaceight cells was 313 compared to that expression in WTcells on the ground, 307 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supple- mentary Data are available at http:online.liebertpub.com doisuppl10.1089ast.2016.1538). The average raw Arg1 gene expression in the three biological replicas of the ARG1 KO spaceight cells was 25 compared to 48 in ARG1 KO cells on the ground. Although Arg1 transcription itself does not appear to be inuenced by the spaceight environment, the impact of re- moving a functional Arg1 gene has a dramatic effect on the expression patterns of many other genes (see following sections). 3.2. Differentially expressed genes in all four comparison groups 3.2.1. Alterations in the expression of 78 genes charac- terize the physiological adaptation of WT cells to spaceight FWt:GWt.The genes involved in physiological adaptation to the spaceight environment were identied for WT cells by comparing the gene expression proles in WT spaceight cells (FWt) to WT ground control cells (GWt) in the FWt: GWtgroup comparison (Fig. 1B). In that comparison 78 genes were signicantly differentially expressed between the two cell treatments at pvalue 0.01 and log2 Fold Change 1; 46 genes were upregulated, and 32 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2; Table S1 Gene list 78). The functional annotation of the genes of the FWt:GWt group comparison indicated that genes of the endomembrane system, Golgi apparatus, and plant-type cell wall were highly represented in the WT adaptation to spaceight. For instance, genes localized to Golgi apparatus were all upregulated in theWT spaceight cells compared to the ground counterparts (e.g., At3g18260 Reticulon family protein; At1g77510 PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2 protein disulde isomerase-like 1-2localized to the endomembrane system; At4g07960 CSLC12 cellulose-synthase-like C12 and At2g03760 ST1 sulpho- transferase 12; Table 1 GO 78; Table S1 Gene list 78). Thedefense response group was also highly represented among the Biological Process ontology (gProler, TAIR, AgriGO), with pathogencell wallassociated genes At3g43250,At2g44490 ( PEN2 ), and At2g03760 ( ST1) being upregulated. 3.2.2. Cells lacking functional Arg1 changed the expres- sion of 130 genes to adapt to spaceight, and those geneswere fundamentally different than those of WT cellsF Arg: GArg.The genes involved in physiological adaptation to the spaceight environment were identied for ARG1 KO cellsby comparing the gene expression proles in ARG1 KO spaceight cells (FArg) to ARG1 KO ground control cells (GArg) in the FArg:GArggroup comparison of (Fig. 1B). There were 130 genes signicantly differentially expressed between spaceight and ground control at pvalue 0.01 and log2 Fold Change 1; 68 genes were upregulated, and 62 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2; Table S2 Gene list 130). The functional annotation of the genes of the FArg:GArggroup comparison indicated that physi ological adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells relied on metabolic processes distinct from those usedin WT cells. Genes of the cell per iphery from the GO Cellular Components category, response to hormone and response to lipid, and xyloglucan metabolic process of the GO BiologicalProcesses, and transporter activity from the GO Molecular Function categories, were highly represented among the genes ARG1 KO cells differentially exp ressed to adapt to spaceight. For example, three genes of the cell wallrelated xyloglucanmetabolic processes (At1g68560 XYL1 alpha-xylosidase 1; At4g03210 XTH9 xyloglucan endotransglucosylasehydrolase 9 and At2g06850 XTH4 xyloglucan endotransglucosylasehydrolase 4) were substantially downregulated in spaceight ARG1 KO cells (Table S2 Gene list 130; Table 2 GO 130), whereas cell wallassociated genes were upregulated in WTcells. Genes encoding cellular t ransporters were generally up- regulated in ARG KO as compared to their ground counterparts cells; examples include At1g80510 Transmembrane amino acidtransporter family protein, At2g38330 MATE efux family:: G ArgF Arg G Arg : F WtGWtF Arg F Wt G Wt:127 37 5107 90 FIG. 2.

The 90 genes were differ-entially expressed due to the Arg1 mutation on the ground with approximately as many genes upregulated (39) as downregulated (51) (Fig. 2; Table S3 Gene list 90). Many genes with adjusted expression to the Arg1 mutation on the ground classied as plasma membrane, membrane, and cell periphery Cellular Component ontology (gProler). For instance, genes At2g44490 PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase super-family protein localized to the membrane and participating in the defense response and At4g40070 RINGU-box superfamily protein localized to the extracellular region were upregulated.On the other hand, genes At4g30660 Low temperature and saltresponsive, At2g36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic pro- tein, At3g26830 PAD3 PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 3 had substantially diminished expression level in ARG1 KO cells onthe ground than WT cells (Table 3 GO 90; Table S3 Gene list 90). The heterocycle metabolic process and organelle organi- zation were among the Biological Process ontology terms rep-resented by genes affected by Arg1 mutation on the ground. For instance, genes At5g39500 GNL1 GNOM-like 1 partici- pating in the ER body organization, endocytosis and the ret-rograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to ER, chromosomemaintenance genes At4g02060 PRL Minichromosome main- tenance (MCM235) family protein, and At5g48600 SMC3 structural maintenance of chromosome 3 had diminished ex-pression on the ground in ARG1 KO cells relative to WT cells. 3.2.4. Comparison of the gene expression proles between ARG1 KO and WT genotypes during spaceight shows unique genotype-specic expression patternsFArg:FWt.The genes differentially expressed between ARG1 KO cells andWT cells in the spaceight environment were identied by comparing the gene expression proles in ARG1 KO spaceight cells (FArg) to WT spaceight cells (FWt) in the FArg:FWtgroup comparison (Fig. 1B). There were 107 genes signicantly differentially expressed between ARG1 KO and WT cell samples in spaceight (Fig. 2). Nearly half the genes were upregulated in ARG1 KO cells in spaceightand half downregulated as compared to WT cells in spaceight (Table S4 Gene list 107). Many genes differentially e xpressed between the WT and ARG1 KO cells in spaceight were classied in GO Biological Processes ontology (gProler, AgriGO) as transport and estab- lishment of localization, developmental, and xyloglucan meta-bolic processes (Table 4 GO 107; Table S4 Gene list 107). Interestingly, the genes related to transport processes (At4g37640 ACA2 calcium ATPase 2, At2g01980 SOS1 so-dium proton exchanger, At5g49500 SRP54 Signal recognition particle, At5g03280 PIR2 NRAMP metal ion transporter, At4g35410 Clathrin adaptor complex, At2g26900 BASS2 So-dium Bile acid symporter, and At1g22710 SUT1 sucrose-protons y m p o r t e r2 )a l ls h o w e dm u c hr e d u c e de x p r e s s i o ni ns p a c e - ight in ARG1 KO cells as compared to WT cells. Similarly, all four genes associated with the xyloglucan metabolic process(At1g68560 XYL1 alpha-xylosidase 1, At4g03210 XTH9 xy- loglucan endotransglucosylasehydrolase 9, At1g11545 XTH8, and At2g06850 XTH4) were also signicantly diminished in thespaceight ARG1 KO cells compared to the spaceight WT cells. Finally, 14 genes out of 15 representing the transporter activity term of the Molecular Function ontology were alsounder-expressed in ARG1 KO spa ceight cells as compared to WT spaceight cells (Table S4 Gene list 107). 3.3. Physiological adaptation to spaceight of ARG1 KO cells is fundamentally different from WT cells comparing FWt:GWtto FArg:GArg Most of the genes engaged in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in ARG1 KO cells were fundamentally different thanthose engaged in WT cells. When the 130 genes differentially e x p r e s s e di nt h eFArg:GArggroup comparison were compared to the 78 genes differentially expressed in the FWt:GWtgroup comparison, only three genes changed in the exact same way: At3g08590 putative 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phos- phoglycerate mutase, At3g30843 hypothetical protein, andAt5g56270 transcription factor WRKY2 (Fig. 2, Table S1Gene list 78 and Table S2 Gene list 130). These three genes, therefore, constitute the only genes of the WT response that are totally independent of ARG1 function. The remaining 127genes of the ARG1 adaptation to the spaceight environment constitute an adaptation unique to the ARG1 KO genotype. 3.4. The gene expression patterns on the ground play a fundamental role in the gene expression patterns of spaceightcomparing GArg:GWt The information about the expression pattern of the 90 genes differentially expressed on the ground between theWT and ARG1 KO cells, GArg:GWt, was assessed in all other comparison groups: the physiological adaptation to spaceight in WT cells, FWt:GWt, the physiological ad- aptation to spaceight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg:GArg, and between genotypes in spaceight, FArg:FWt(Fig. 3). The 25 genes of the 90 (GArg:GWt) showed signicantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation tospaceight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg:GArg, but no signicant differential expression in WT cells, FWt:GWt( F i g .3 ,C a t e g o r y I). Thus the ARG1 KO cells corr ected the expression of those genes as they adapted to spaceight, apparently to reestablish the WT level of expression that is needed in that environment. These genes included, for example, At1g32950 (Subtilase genescommonly associated with plant defense and cell wall metabo-lism) and At2g36830 (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein) (Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3). The 12 genes out of 90 (G Arg:GWt) showed signicant differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in WT cells (FWt:GWt) but no signicant expres- sion in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in ARG1 KOcells (FArg:GArg) (Fig. 3, Category II). This genotype-based change in the ARG1 KO ground control cells resulted in theARG1 IN SPACEFLIGHT ADAPTATION 1091expression levels of these genes on the ground matching the WT expression levels in spaceight. There was a single gene (At2g40020, hypothetical histone-lysine N-methyltransferaseprotein) among these 12 with an unusual behavior, as it wasalso differentially expressed in spaceight between the two genotypes. However all 12 genes were considered to be ex- pressed in the ARG1 KO on the ground at the level required forthe WT physiological adaptation to spaceight. These genes included genes associated with the extracellular region ( e.g., At1g30600 Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 lipase; At1g13080 CYP71B2 cytochrome P450; At1g07380 ceramidase activity; At2g44490 PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein associated with plant defense and cell wallmetabolism; Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3). The 53 genes out of 90 (G Arg:GWt) showed no differ- ential expression in any other comparison group (Fig. 3, Category III). Thus, although the gene expression patternsbetween genotypes on the ground were different, both cell lines likely made only small adjustments to gene expression, which resulted in no change in expression levels when thetwo genotypes from spaceight were compared. Some of these genes represented plasma membrane and membrane related processes: At4g11850 PLDGAMMA1 phospholi-pase D gamma, At2g02170 Remorin family protein, At5g52440 HCF106 Bacterial sec-independent translocation protein mttAHcf1061 importing protein into chloroplastthylakoid membrane, At5g39500 GNL1 GNOM-like 1participating in the ER body organization, endocytosis andthe retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to ER (Table 5 GO Fig. 3; Table S5 Gene list Fig. 3). With the exception of At2g40020, none of the 90 genes that were differentially expressed between genotypes on theground (G Arg:GWt) showed differential expression between genotypes in the spaceight environment (FArg:FWt). 3.5. Corrected and compensated expression 3.5.1. Corrected expression: the patterns of the genes associated with spaceight physiological adaptation affected byArg1 mutationcomparing FArg:GArg,FWt:GWt, and FArg: FWt.Information about the differential expression of the 130 genes differentially expressed in the physiological ad- aptation to spaceight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg:GArg) was assessed in the physiological adaptation to spaceight ofWT cells (FWt:GWt) group comparison and in the space- ight genotype comparison group (FArg:FWt; Table S6 Gene list 102 CORRECTED Fig. 4A). Each of the 130genes was signicantly differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in ARG1 KO cells, FArg:GArgand could be also signicantly differentially expressed in other comparison groups. There were three genes out of 130 (FArg:GArg) that showed signicant differential expression in the physiolog- ical adaptation to spaceight of WT cells (FWt:GWt) group comparison and no differential expression in the spaceight genotype comparison group (FArg:FWt; Fig. 4, Category I).

These 102 genes represented genes typically associated with the cell periphery, endomembrane system and Golgi apparatus,plastid and chloroplast of the Cellular Component as well as the single-organism localization and transport and signaling of the Biological Process ontology terms. Particularly genes ofthe transmembrane transport of various moieties were highlyrepresented ( e.g., AT1G80510 Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein, AT2G38330 MATE efux family protein, AT2G36830 TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein,AT5G20280 SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F, AT3G 05030 NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2, and AT1G71050 HIPP20 Heavy metal transportdetoxication superfamilyprotein) (Table 6 GO Fig. 4A; Table S6 Gene list 102 COR- RECTED Fig. 4A). Genes associated with cell signaling were also found among these 102 genes (AT1G03060 SPI BeigeBEACH domain; WD domain, G-beta repeat protein, AT2G 43010 SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, AT3G20410 CPK9 calmodulin-domain protein kinase 9, AT3G16570RALF23 rapid alkalinization factor 23). There were 25 genes out of 130 (F Arg:GArg)t h a ts h o w e dn o signicant differential expression in the physiological adap- tation to spaceight of WT cells (FWt:GWt) group comparison and signicant differential expression in the spaceight ge- notype comparison group (FArg:FWt)( F i g .4C a t e g o r yI I I ) . Thus, these 25 genes are potentially genes of the genotype-specic strategy to adapt to the spaceight. Some of these genes encoded genes represented in the xyloglucan metabolic processes related to the cell wall remodeling: AT1G68560XYL1 alpha-xylosidase 1, AT4G03210 XTH9 xyloglucanendotransglucosylasehydrolase 9, AT2G06850 XTH4 xy- loglucan endotransglucosylasehydrolase 4 (Table 7 GO Fig. 4B; Table S6 Gene list 102 CORRECTED Fig. 4A). 3.5.2. Compensated adaptation, revealing adaptive strat- egies to spaceightcomparing FArg:FWt,FWt:GWt, and FArg:GArg.The information about the differential expression of the 107 genes differentially expressed in the spaceight ge-notype comparison group (FArg:FWt) was assessed in the physiological adaptation to spaceight of WT cells (FWt:GWt) group comparison and in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in ARG1 KO cells FArg:GArg(Fig. 4B; Table S7 Gene list 107 COMPENSATED Fig. 4B). Each of the 107 genes was signicantly differen tially expressed in the space- ight genotype comparison group FArg:FWtand could be also signicantly differentially expr essed in other comparison group, but this was not a required feature of the categorical response. There were 25 genes of 107 (FArg:FWt) that showed signi- cant differential expression in physiological adaptation to spaceight in the ARG1 KO cells FArg:GArggroup comparison (Fig. 4A Category IV and Fig. 4B Category I). There were 82 genes of 107 (FArg:FWt) that showed no signicantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in the ARG1 KO cells FArg:GArg (Fig. 4B Category II and III).FIG. 5.

Independent Group , Category I3 genes showed same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceight environment in both WT and ARG1 KO cells and showed no differential expression in either transcriptome. These genes showed differential expression in FWt:GWt, differential expression in FArg:GArg,n o differential expression in GArg:GWt, and no differential expression in FArg:FWt. Dependent Group , Category II12 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in WT but were voided during the physiological adaptation to the spaceight environment when Arg1 was mutated. These genes showed differential expression in FWt:GWt, no differential expression in FArg:GArg,n o differential expression in GArg:GWt, and differential expression in FArg:FWt. Dependent Group , Category III12 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in WT cells and differential expression in the ground transcriptome between ARG1 KO and WT, matching the WT spaceight expression level. These genes showed differential expression in FWt:GWt, no differential expression in FArg:GArg, differential expression in GArg:GWt, and no differential expression in FArg:FWt. Partially Dependent Group , Category IV51 genes showed differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceight in WT cells alone. These genes showed differential expression in FWt:GWt, no differential expression in FArg:GArg, no differential expression in GArg:GWt, and no differential expression in FArg:FWt.

The Category I, II, III, and IV of the respective dependence groups are same as dened in Fig. 5A. Dependent Group , Category Vgenes were differentially expressed one way in the WT spaceight-to- ground transcriptomes and the other way in the ARG1 KO spaceight-to-ground transcriptomes, and were also opposite in patterns between WT and ARG1 KO within environments. These genes showed differential expression in FWt:GWt, differential expression in FArg:GArg, differential expression in GArg:GWt, and differential expression in FArg:FWt. The column in gray font corresponds to Fig. 5A and the gene distribution at the pvalue 0.01. The columns in black font summarize the gene number distributions showed on the heat maps. Abbreviations: ND not detected; .02, .03, .04, .05 stringency criteria of the pvalue 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05, respectively.ARG1 IN SPACEFLIGHT ADAPTATION 1101Some of these 82 genes were associated with components of the extracellular region, cell wall, external encapsulating structure, cell periphery, plasma membrane, endomembranesystem, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus of the Cel-lular Compartment ontology terms (gProler). Also, cellular aromatic compound metabolic process, localization, and transmembrane transport were represented among the Bio-logical Process ontology terms. Two genes represented the cellular aromatic compound metabolic process (At4g37650 SHR GRAS family transcription factor and At3g20540 PolIBpolymerase gamma 1). Genes involved in sugar transport (e.g.,At1g77210 STP14 sugar transporter 14 and At2g43240 Nucleotide-sugar transporter family protein) and genes in-volved in vesicle-mediated transport ( e.g., At5g56230 PRA1.G2 prenylated RAB acceptor 1.G2 and At4g35410 Clathrin adaptor complex small-chain family protein) were representative of other transport processes (Table 7 GOFig. 4B; Table S7 Gene list 107 COMPENSATED Fig. 4B). With the exception of At2g40020 mentioned above, none of the 107 genes that were signicantly differentially ex-pressed in the spaceight genotype comparison group F Arg: FWtshowed signicant differential expression in the ground genotype comparison group GArg:GWt(Fig. 4B). 3.5.3. The Arg1 -dependent genes in the WT adaptive strategycomparing FWt:GWtand FArg:GArg.The 78 genes signicantly differentially expressed between theground and spaceight in WT cells established the base of genes needed to adapt to spaceight. Each gene of 78 FWt: GWtwas categorized into Arg1 -independent, Arg1 - dependent, or partially Arg1 -dependent. A gene was considered Arg1 independent if it showed the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptationto the spaceight environment in both WT and ARG1 KO cells; thus the same change in gene expression was observed in FWt:GWtand FArg:GArg(Fig. 5A). The expression of such a gene was adapted to the spaceight environment in the samefashion regardless of the Arg1 mutation. There were three genes where Arg1 seemed to have no role in the physiological adaptation (Fig. 5A Category I; Table S8 Gene list 78 DE-PENDENCE Fig. 5). A gene was considered Arg1 dependent if it did not show the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptationto the spaceight environment in ARG1 KO cells, F Arg:GArg, as it did in WT cells FWt:GWt(Fig. 5A). There were 24 genes exhibiting the Arg1 dependence (Fig. 5A Categories II, III, Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). These 24 Arg1 -dependent genes could be divided into two categories based on the source of the Arg1 dependency: Category II or III of Fig. 5A. Category II genes of Fig. 5Awere not differentially expressed in either the physiological adaptation to spaceight in ARG1 KO cells (FArg:GArg)o r ground genotype comparison (GArg:GWt), but showed differential expression in the spaceight genotype compar- ison (FArg:FWt). Thus, the absence of a functional Arg1 gene had the impact of rendering the adaptive-to-spaceightgenes unresponsive (Fig. 5A, Category II). The majority of those genes were associated with the endomembrane system and Golgi apparatus or the intracellular membrane-boundedorganelle and cell periphery and plasma membrane GO terms of the Cellular Component ontology ( e.g.,At3g49780, PSK4 phytosulfokine 4 precursor and At2g43240, Nucleotide-sugartransporter family protein) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). Ca- tegory III genes of Fig. 5A were not differentially expressed inthe physiological adaptation to spaceight in ARG1 KO cells(F Arg:GArg), were differentially expressed in ground genotype comparison (GArg:GWt), but showed no differential expression in spaceight genotype comparison (FArg:FWt). These genes were already altered on the ground in ARG1 KO cells to match the spaceight expression levels in WT (Fig. 5A, Category III). There were 12 genes showing such an expression pattern,some of which were associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism ( e.g., At1g30600, Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 alphabeta-Hydrolases superfamily protein andAt2g44490, PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein)(Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). There were 51 differentially expressed genes in F Wt:GWt that were not signicantly differentially expressed in any other comparison group (Fig. 5A, Category IV). These genes were considered Arg1 Partially Dependent as there was not enough statistical support to assign them to either the independent or dependent group. These 51 genes were primarily associated with the GO Biological Process of response to stimulus, withfew related to the response to light ( e.g., At3g08570 Phototropic-responsive NPH3 family protein, At5g63600 FLS5 avonol synthase 5, At1g76570 Chlorophyll A-Bbinding family protein or to high light stimulus At1g77510PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2) (Table 8 GO DEPENDENCE Fig. 5A; Table S8 Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. 5). The distribution of 78 genes signicantly differentially ex- pressed between the ground and spaceight in WT cells (F Wt: GWt) among the Independent, Dependent, and Partially De- pendent was established with increasingly relaxed pvalue stringency criteria from pvalue 0.01 through pvalue 0.05 without changing the stringency of the Fold Change criteria (-1FC log2 1) (Fig. 5B). The number of Independent genes increased from three through ve up to six genes. The Depen-dent genes not only increased in total numbers, but a new group of Dependent genes emerged. The three to four genes showed the new expression pattern such that they were coordinatelydifferentially expressed in WT spaceight adaptation (F Wt: GWt) and in the ground genotype comparison between WT and ARG1 KO cells (GArg:GWt) yet the opposite in the ARG1 KO spaceight adaptation (FArg:GArg) and in the spaceight ge- notype comparison between the WT and ARG1 KO cells (FArg: FWt) (Fig. 5B Category V). The biggest depletion of gene total number was in the Partially Dependent gene pool, from 51 genes at the pvalue 0.01, through 43, 37, 35, and 31 at the p value 0.05 (Fig. 5B Category IV). 3.6. The microarray data validation To validate the correctness of the signicance criteria applied in the microarray data analysis, the RT-qPCR was performed. For objectiveness, the target genes were selected from among the signicantly differentially expressed genesin the WT spaceight cells of the BRIC-16 experiment (Paul et al., 2012). The RT-qPCR results aligned with those of the microarray (Supplementary Fig. S2). Only one gene, theAgp12 , showed signicant under-expression in the space- ight ARG1 KO cells relative to their ground control counterparts as identied in the microarray data analysis and1102 ZUPANSKA ET AL.Table 8.GO Dependence Fig .5A The signicant GO terms assigned to the genes in Arg1-Independent, Arg1-Dependent , and Arg1-Partially Dependent categories based on gProler and AgriGO functional annotation.

The Agp12 gene target in all other comparison groups as well as the re- maining targets across all comparison groups showed nodifferential expression levels as measured by the means ofmicroarrays or RT-qPCR. The signicance stringency cri- teria applied throughout the microarray analysis seemingly prevent the false-positive or false-negative inclusion. 4. Discussion The gene Arg1 was found to have a dramatic inuence on the gene expression proles that dene physiological ad- aptation of cell cultures to spaceight. Like WT cells, the ARG1 KO cells thrived in the spaceight environment,suggesting that the presence of ARG1 is not absolutely re- quired for physiological adaptation to spaceight. However, the ARG1 has an essential role in dening the WT adapta-tion to spaceight. ARG1 KO cells adapted to spaceight byexpressing different genes, providing unique insight into the alternative pathways for physiological adaptation of undif- ferentiated cells to the spaceight. 4.1. WT adaptation to spaceight is highly dependent upon Arg1 There were 78 genes differentially expressed in WT when comparing spaceight to ground control. Those 78 genes comprise the obvious primary set of genes involved inspaceight physiological adaptation of WT cells. Only three of these 78 genes were similarly changed in ARG1 KO cells, suggesting that only these three were completely independentofArg1 (SeeIndependent group below and in Fig. 2, Fig. 4A Category I, Fig. 5A Category I). The remaining 75 genes are most likely reliant on Arg1 function. Twenty-four of these genes are denitively dependent upon Arg1 at the highest levels of analytical stringency (Categories II, III of Fig. 5A). The remaining 51 genes are likely to be dependent upon Arg1 but do not reach pvalue of 0.01 (Category IV of Fig. 5A); however, reducing the required pvalue level brings more genes from the Partially Dependent group into the clearly Dependent group (Fig. 5B). This result strongly suggests that Arg1 has a prominent role in generating a large part of what would be considered the proper spaceight gene expression prole for spaceight adaptation in WT cells. 4.2 Without functional Arg1, cells engage a unique gene expression strategy that further illuminates required elements of the WT spaceight adaptation ARG1 KO cells engaged vastly different genes to adapt to spaceight than did WT cells, suggesting that not only isArg1 function required for much of the WT adaptation to spaceight, but also that cells without Arg1 can compensate for the lack of Arg1 by changing the expression of a dif- ferent set of genes. This suggests that the genotype, and likely then physiological state, of the cell line on the ground profoundly affects the genes engaged in the physiologicaladaptation to the spaceight environment. The gene expression proles seen in the ground genotype comparisons suggested that WT and ARG1 KO cells have different gene expression requirements for the maintenanceof a healthy physiology in a normal terrestrial environment. The basis for engaging very different genes in the phys- iological adaptation to spaceight in the ARG1 KO can beexplained along two lines of reasoning. First, some genes involved in WT adaptation to spaceight were already changed to a spaceight-adapted level in ARG1 KO on theground and were therefore not needed to be differentiallyexpressed as the ARG1 KO adapted to spaceight (Fig. 3 Category II, 12 genes). These genes are Required in that they must be maintained at the WT spaceight level in orderfor these cells to adapt to spaceight. Second, some of the genes that showed differential expression on the ground between the ARG1 KO and WT cells were Corrected to match WT expression levels during the ARG1 KO physio- logical adaptation to spaceight (Fig. 3 Category I, 25 genes; the same 25 genes found in Fig. 4A Category II).These genes dene a new part of the overall landscape ofgenes involved in the physiological adaptation to space- ight: those which are needed to be at a certain level of expression in spaceight, but if that level is already presentin ground transcriptome, it is not necessary to alter expression patterns to achieve the spaceight transcriptome. However, if their expression on the ground is altered due to confoundingfactors, such as a mutant background or physiological stress, then expression levels would need to be corrected for space- ight transcriptome, thereby revealing essential genes thatwould otherwise be missed. An additional set of Corrected genes are those that are differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation tospaceight in ARG1 KO. The 77 genes from Category III(Fig. 4A) comprise such a group. As with the Category II genes in Fig. 4A, these genes were corrected to WT spaceight levels during the ARG1 KO adaptation tospaceight. Taken together, these 77 genes plus the afore- mentioned 25 reveal 102 genes that comprise a previously unappreciated part of the spaceight adaptation process. Some of the genes that showed differential expression in ARG1 KO cells in spaceight adaptation were also differ- entially expressed between ARG1 KO and WT cells inspaceight. These 25 genes apparently Compensated for the absence of a functional Arg1 both on the ground and during spaceight (25 labeled with an asterisk, Fig. 4A, Category IV). These genes would not be a part of the typicalWT spaceight response but are necessary in the ARG1 KO to adapt to spaceight. 4.3. The landscape of genes required for physiological adaptation to spaceight The landscape of the genetic requirements for spaceight adaptation is much more complex than is revealed by the genes that are changed in expression in WT cells adapted tospaceight. The complexity of the physiological adaptiveprocesses related to genotype is represented in the Venn diagram of Fig. 6. In the WT response 78 genes are changed in expression, leading to the conclusion that these are thegenes necessary for adaptation. ARG1 KO data suggest that this is an overly simple view of the adaptation requirements of WT cells. ARG1-mutant cells show that many geneswhose expression is altered on the ground by that genotype must be corrected to WT levels to adapt to spaceight. These observations suggest that adaptation of a cell line to spaceight is highly dependent on its physiological state, which is in turn guided by its genotype. The two cell lines in this study arrived at a different gene expression prole on1104 ZUPANSKA ET AL.orbit and changed expression of a different set of genes to get to that prole. Therefore, it is likely that there is no single gene expression prole that denes the spaceight-adapted state for Arabidopsis cells. Rather each cell type and genotype will have a largely unique-appearing change in gene expression proles in adapting to spaceight. 4.4. Biological implications of the gene expression proles The agriGO PAGE tool (http:systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn agriGOv2) was used to evaluate specically enriched bio- logical processes in each of the comparison sets (Fig. 7). In addition, the potential roles of individual genes comprising the differential expression groups of the landscape described above (Independent ,Dependent ,Required ,Corrected ,Compen- sated ;F i g .6 )w e r ee x a m i n e di nm o r ed e t a i l . The PAGE analysis revealed that although individual genes may differ in each expression set, those genes are largely representative of the same biological processes,suggesting different paths can be taken to arrive at the same destination. For instance, processing all 180 Important (Fig. 6) genes in PAGE indicated some variety in the bio-logical processes engaged in each spaceight-to-ground, and genotype-to-genotype, comparison. If the gene sets com- prising the subcategories on Important genes are processed(Independent ,Dependent ,Partially Dependent , and Corrected ; Fig. 6), there were no signicant differences inthe general biological processes used by the two genotypes to physiologically adapt to spaceight (middle panels Fig. 7). In other words, depending on the initial resourcesavailable in a cells metabolic tool box, slightly different routes of approach appear to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. A closer look at the genomicstrategies used by WT and ARG1 KO cells to navigate di-verse routes to a common goal revealed genes essential to spaceight adaptation, including genes that would be masked if we were to have simply essayed WT responsestrategies alone. Although there was not always a common functionally binding them together, in many cases, genes comprising each category dened above were often alignedin strategic roles. 4.4.1. Independent genes. The genes of this small cat- egory are tied together by potential roles in the detection and maintenance of cell polarity. The most highly induced of theIndependent genes is a WRKY2 (At5g56270) transcription factor known to play a major role in the establishment of cell polarity by regulating apicalbasal cell fate by activatingWOX8 (Jeong et al., 2016). Cell polarity is also tied to auxin transport (Gao et al., 2008), and if the pvalue is relaxed to a value 0.05 (see Fig. 5B), two of the three additional genes that become included are associated withauxinbrassinosteroid signaling pathways: At1g78860, a curculin-like family protein, and At4g22500, an auxin- induced gene of unknown function (GEO GDS744) (Huang2551 2433Compensated for the lack of Arg1 82 unique to ARG1 KO spaceflight102 Corrected to WT levels in ARG1 KO Changed WT Spaceflight180 genes Important for WT spaceflight adaptation 51Arg1 PartiallyDependent 24Arg1 Dependent 107 total: FLT ARG1 KO vs FLT WT130 total: FLT ARG1 KO vs GC ARG1 KO78 total: FLT WT vs GC WTArg1 Independent FIG. 6. The gene landscape for physiological adaptation to spaceight. At least 180genes are Important for spaceight adaptation. These genes were not differentially expressed in the spaceight transcriptomes between WT and ARG1 KO.Seventy-eight genes in WT and 130 in ARG1 KO were differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceight, thus also between spaceight and ground. Three of these genes were coordinately expressed in both genotypes; thus they were independent ofArg1 function. Of the 78 genes of the WT physiological adaptation to spaceight, 51were at least partially dependent , and 24were dependent onArg1 . There were 102 genes whose expression needed to be corrected to WT spaceight adaptation levels in the ARG1 KO cells. There were 107genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceight transcriptomes between ARG1 KO cells in spaceight and WT cells in spaceight; 25of these genes compensated for the lack of a functional Arg1 gene in the ARG1 KO cells and were part of the physiological adaptation to spaceight ARG1 KO cells alone (Fig. 4A Category IV and Fig. 4B, Category I indicated with ), 82of these genes compensated for the lack of a functional Arg1 gene in the ARG1 KO cells but were not a part of the physiological adaptation to spaceight.ARG1 IN SPACEFLIGHT ADAPTATION 1105Gene Group GO Term Ont No. Description 1 2 3 4 Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR GO:0009628 P 11 response abiotic stimulus 2.1 1.2 0.034 1.3 0.98 0.19 0.18 0.015 0.86 -0.76 -0.17 0.45 GO:0043412 P 12 macromolecule modif -1.6 -0.56 0.1 2 1.3 0.041 -3.1 -1.3 0.002 1.5 0.53 0.13 GO:0006464 P 11 protein modification -1.7 -0.63 0.083 1.8 1.2 0.07 -3 -1.3 0.003 1.5 0.55 0.13 GO:0016740 F 22 transferase activity -1.1 -0.19 0.27 1.8 0.97 0.068 -2.4 -0.77 0.018 1.5 0.41 0.14 Gene Group GO Term Ont No. Description 1 2 3 4 Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR 78: WT differential expression - Independent Dependent Partially Dependent Gene Group GO Term Ont No. Description 1 2 3 4 Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR 102: ARG1 KO differential expression - Corrected to WT Gene Group GO Term Ont No. Description 1 2 3 4 Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR Z-score Mean FDR GO:0044238 P 21 primary metab process 0.8 -0.21 0.43 -2.1 -1.1 0.036 -0.11 -0.13 0.91 -1.9 -1.1 0.053 GO:0044237 P 21 cellular metab process 0.84 -0.2 0.4 -2.5 -1.2 0.013 0.96 0.043 0.34 -1.8 -1 0.069 GO:0008152 P 27 metabolic process 1.4 -0.11 0.17 -2.5 -1.2 0.012 -0.28 -0.16 0.78 -2.5 -1.2 0.011 GO:0016787 F 15 hydrolase activity 1.7 0.06 0.099 -2.3 -1.3 0.023 -0.37 -0.19 0.71 -2.5 -1.6 0.012 GO:0003824 F 30 catalytic activity 1.8 -0.037 0.066 -2.4 -1.1 0.017 0.4 -0.06 0.69 -2.4 -1.1 0.016 GO:0016740 F 16 transferase activity 1.7 0.062 0.086 -2.9 -1.5 0.004 0.41 -0.037 0.68 -2.7 -1.6 0.008 GO:0044424 C 42 intracellular part 1.1 -0.21 0.26 -2 -0.91 0.043 0.56 -0.05 0.58 -1.7 -0.74 0.088 GO:0005622 C 42 intracellular 1.1 -0.21 0.26 -2 -0.91 0.043 0.56 -0.05 0.58 -1.7 -0.74 0.088 GO:0005737 C 35 cytoplasm 0.67 -0.27 0.5 -2.2 -1 0.028 0.95 0.006 0.34 -1.4 -0.7 0.15 GO:0044444 C 33 cytoplasmic part 0.92 -0.22 0.36 -2.6 -1.1 0.01 0.99 0.015 0.32 -1.8 -0.85 0.069GArg : GWt FC log2 FArg : FWt FC log2 107: ARG1 KO - Compensated in adaptation to spaceflightCM FWt : GWt FC log2 FArg : GArg FC log2 CM FWt : GWt FC log2 FArg : GArg FC log2 CM FWt : GWt FC log2 FArg : GArg FC log2GArg : GWt FC log2 FArg : FWt FC log2FArg : FWt FC log2 78  102180: Important to WT spaceflight homeostasis CM FWt : GWt FC log2 FArg : GArg FC log2 GArg : GWt FC log2 FArg : FWt FC log2GArg : GWt FC log2 FIG. 7.

The blank rows represent the null results obtained from individual analyses of the two components of the Gene Group 78 102180 Important to WT spaceight adaptation (78: Independent, Dependent, Partially Dependent) and (102: Corrected). Individual comparisons did not display a coordinated pattern of expression according to ontological ca tegories. 1106et al., 2013). Curculin-like genes have also been implicated in the regulatory network that establishes the adaxialabaxial surfaces in Arabidopsis (Reinhart et al., 2013), which also connects to the regulatory pathways that guide polarity inplant cells. 4.4.2. Dependent genes. There were 75 genes that were at least somewhat dependent on a functional Arg1 , many of which were transcription factors associated with the regu- lation of hormone signaling and cell proliferation. The twomost highly induced genes were transcription factors bZIP16 and APD1. Factor bZIP16 primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor of genes responsive to light, gib-berellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) (Hsieh et al., 2012), while RING-nger protein APD1 (ABERRANT POLLEN DEVELOPMENT1) is associated with pollen development and with signaling in the 9-Lipoxygenasepathway central to root development and pathogen defense (Qin et al., 2014; Walper et al., 2016). This latter role could connect it to another highly induced gene in this category:PSK4, which encodes a precursor to Phytosulfokine 4, one of a family of cell wall receptors that function in cell pro- liferation, expansion, and wound repair (Tameshige et al., 2015). Interestingly, PSK4 has been shown to promote callus growth in root explants and, further, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by subtilase SBT1, a gene whichis also induced in spaceight in ARG1 KO cells (Chevalieret al., 2005). The gene SRF5 appears to be a member of the STRUBBELIG family of transmembrane receptor-like ki- nases that contribute to the regulation of cell morphogenesisand proliferation (Chevalier et al., 2005). 4.4.3. Required genes. Among the Dependent genes there were also 12 genes differentially expressed between WT and ARG1 KO cells on the ground, which were further subcategorized as Required (Fig. 5A Category III); many of theRequired genes were associated with pathogen re- sponse. Among the highly induced were an uncharacterized lipase that has been associated with auxin signaling and pathogen response, a cytochrome450 (CYP71B2) that hasshown downregulation in response to pathogens, and PEN2, which encodes a glycosyl hydrolase that is essential for defense against powdery mildew in barley (Schenk et al., 2003; Cabrera et al., 2014). Likewise with the three upre- gulated genes encoding proteasesone encoding a Sub- tilase family protein that has a role in processing a cell wallpectin methylesterase, another was a member of the cysta- tinmonellin superfamily of proteases, a group which plays a role in pathogen resistance, and nally a ubiquitin-likeprotease (Senechal et al., 2014; van Wyk et al., 2014). A gene involved in sphingolipid metabolism (neutralalkaline non-lysosomal ceramidase) was also upregulated. Sphingo- lipids are a class of lipid signaling molecules that play a rolein the apoptotic processes associated with plant pathogen defense, which also ties this Required gene to defense- related metabolism (Berkey et al., 2012). There was one downregulated gene in this group of genes: an un- characterized Zinc knuckle (CCHC-type) family protein (At2g12880). A survey of GEO proles reveals thatAt2g12880 is highly overexpressed in Arabidopsis mutants of subunit 4 (CSN4) of the COP9 signalosome responsible for the regulation of auxin response (Huang et al., 2013).The abundance of pathogen response and cell wallrelated genes in this category suggests that Arg1 plays a role in cell wall remodeling even in the absence of other environmentalstimuli, a role that is consistent with ARG1s functionwithin the endomembrane delivery system. 4.4.4. Corrected genes. The 102 genes in the Cor- rected group (Fig. 4A, Categories II and III) represent a truly unique and fascinating category of genesthese are genes that, while required for spaceight adaptation, wouldnot have been revealed by a spaceight-to-ground compar- ison in WT cells. About a tenth of the 102 genes corrected to WT levels in the ARG1 KO cells in the spaceight tran-scriptome are associated with transport processes. Genesencoding proteins that play a role in the transport of amino acids (Transmembrane amino acid transporter family pro- tein), small molecules (MATE efux family protein, RSH2root hair specic 2), water (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast in- trinsic protein), sugar (SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F), metal ions (HMA5 heavy metal ATPase 5), and protons(NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2) all had expression adjusted to levels comparable to the spaceight tran- scriptome of WT cells. This is another instance where theassociation of ARG1 with intracellular vesicle trafcking (Boonsirichai et al., 2003) supports a role for ARG1 in spaceight adaptation, as cells lacking Arg1 show impair-ment in the intracellular transport among cell compartments.Further, the abundance of the transporter genes brought to the WT expression levels in the ARG1 KO spaceight transcriptome could suggest that the transmembrane trans-port processes may be affected by a reduced gravity envi- ronment and that a certain level of transporter gene expression is required to assure the efcient continuum oftheir performance. Genes associated with hormone-mediated signaling are also well represented among the genes that are corrected toWT levels in the ARG1 KO spaceight transcriptome. Ex-amples include WD domain, G-beta repeat protein gene, SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, and UNS2 Acyl- CoA N-acyltransferases (NAT) These genes are associatedprimarily with plant growth, cell expansion and architecture, and morphogenesis (Lehman et al., 1996; Schwab et al., 2003; Saedler et al., 2009; Nomoto et al., 2012), suggesting that the cell growth may need to be adjusted in spaceight and that a certain level expression of development-related genes may be required. 4.4.5. Compensated genes. There were 107 genes that appear to help compensate for the lack of Arg1 in cells (Fig. 4A Category IV; Fig. 4B). Together, these 107 genesdene the genotype-specic strategy employed by cells lacking an active Arg1 gene to physiologically adapt to the spaceight environment, and provide a link to the role ofArg1 in adapting to spaceight (Fig. 6). Genes associated with cell-wall metabolism gure prominently in this category. For example, genes partici-pating primarily in molecular grafting of xyloglucan chains such as At1g68560, alpha-xylosidase 1, and the two xyloglu- can endotransglucosylasehydr olases, XTH9 (At4g03210) and XTH4 (At2g06850), were signicantly downregulated in ARG1 KO in spaceight transcriptome compared to WT cells. This activity suggests that the process of splitting andorARG1 IN SPACEFLIGHT ADAPTATION 1107reconnection of the xyloglucan cross-links in the cell wall occurred in the spaceight in cells lacking Arg1 in a manner different from WT cells. Further, the repression of thesecell-wall remodeling genes indicates that cell-wall looseningprocesses and cell expansion were diminished in spaceight when Arg1 gene is absent. It is well documented that cell wall remodeling is a component of both spaceight adap-tation and as a response to hypergravity (Nedukha, 1997; Soga et al., 1999, 2002; Paul et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015). The synthesis and assembly of m any cell wall components are dependent on the Golgi apparatus and transport vesicles to the plasma membrane. Genes involved in intracellular transport were also highly represented in those differentially expressedin spaceight transcriptomes when Arg1 function was dis- abled. For instance, the genes as sociated with vesicle-mediated transport such as Prenylated RAB acceptor 1.G2 (At5g56230), SRP54 signal recognition particle (At5g49500) of the signalrecognition in the endoplasmic reticulum, SOS1 sodium proton exchanger (At2g01980) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, and a Clathrin adaptor complex protein (At4g35410)were all differentially expressed in the spaceight samples between ARG1 KO and WT cells. The endomembrane system, intracellular transport, and vesicle trafcking genes were also alarge part of the WT physiological adaptation to the spaceight environment, although the ind ividual representative genes differed from those engaged in the ARG1 KO cells. Thisnding reinforces the conclusion that these processes aresensitive to the reduced-gravity environment and that cells handle them differently depending on ARG1 availability. The importance of vesicle trafcking and intracellular transport hasalso been identied in ground s tudies that demonstrated mu- tants of a vacuolar membrane system genes exhibited agra- vitropic phenotypes (Kato et al., 2002; Surpin, 2014). In addition, ground studies have shown that chemical treatments that disrupt gravitropism cause aberrant endomembrane morphologies, particu larly of vacuoles, which underscores the link between the endomembrane system and gravitropism inplants (Surpin et al., 2005). If indeed ARG1 executes its role in the adaptation to spaceight microgravity through the en- domembrane system, then the link of the endomembranesystem to gravity sensing in the specialized cells of the plant root could be extended to include undifferentiated cells as well. Connecting ARG1 to gravity perception in undifferentiatedcells would imply a universal, cell-type independent tool for gravity sensing in plants. Another group of genes in this category associate with gravitropism on the ground through auxin signaling and cell polarity. POL, a Protein phosphatase 2C family protein (At2g46920) and the GRAS family transcription factorSGR7 (SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 7-At4g37650) showedsubstantially diminished expression level in the ARG1 KO spaceight transcriptome compared to WT cells. POL plays a role in establishing and maintaining the stem cell polarityand localization of auxin signaling (Gagne et al., 2008), and SRG7 is involved in radial organization of the root and shoot axial organs that are responsible for directing asym-metric cell division (Koizumi et al., 2012). The most pro- minent example of ARG1 engagement in establishing cell polarity occurs in root statocytes upon gravistimulation andis a basis for root gravitropism. In ground studies, ARG1 KO plants exhibit increased auxin accumulation in root tips, which then results in a strong defect in root gravitropism(Sedbrook et al., 1998). Although ARG1 protein is likely to play a role in enabling auxin redistribution in statocytes, ARG1s wide association with the endomembrane systemand cytoskeleton suggests a more diverse role in gravitysensing in plants, which is actually well aligned with the concept that ARG1 might be important to undifferentiated cells. ARG1 might mediate gravity signal transduction inundifferentiated cells by promoting the folding, targeting, or degradation of gravitropic regulators in the vicinity of the cytoskeletal network. The observation that the genes relatedto the gravity sensing and signaling were compensated in the ARG1 KO cells suggests that alternative systems to the ARG1 exist and were required for successful spaceightadaptation. 4.5. BRIC-16 This experiment is the second time that Arabidopsis cell cultures were sent into space. The rst cell culture experi- ment was launched to the ISS in 2010 on STS131 (BRIC-16)(Paul et al., 2012). These two BRIC cell culture experiments were substantially different in many aspects. First, the cells used in BRIC-16 and BRIC-17 were of different agesbefore launch, as dened by the amount of time grown on solid media after being transferred from liquid culture. The BRIC-16 cells spent an additional week on solid mediacompared to the BRIC-17 cells. Second, the BRIC-17 cul-tures were freshly established, while the BRIC-16 culture had been established as a culture line for years. When the new mutant (ARG1 KO) cell line was created, we simul-taneously created the comparable WT line to minimize physiological differences in the two BRIC-17 lines. And nally, besides the differences in the biological material,there were differences in the experimental prole of BRIC- 17 as compared to BRIC-16: the space vehicle used to launch to the ISS, the mission prole, and the days spent inmicrogravity (Table S9). The spaceight transcriptomes of the WT cells of BRIC- 16 and BRIC-17 CEL had only one differentially expressed gene in common (At5g62710, a protein kinase). However,the general patterns of gene expression in both experiments suggest they held many of the same strategies of physio- logical adaptation in common. In BRIC-16, although thelargest category of genes induced were heat-shock genes, among the next most highly differentially expressed genes were those associated with pathogen response, wounding,and cell wall remodeling; a pattern that is closely aligned with the current study (Paul et al., 2012). The WT cells used in both experiments were of identical genotype; thus themost likely explanation for the paucity of coordinately ex-pressed genes between the two spaceight experiments is that each cell line began their respective ights with a ground transcriptome prole that reected environmentaland developmental parameters unique to each experiment. The BRIC-16 cells may have already engaged a series of adaptive strategies that were not necessary in the WT cells ofBRIC-17; it is likely that the abundance of heat-shock and stress-response genes in the BRIC-16 spaceight tran- scriptome pattern was related to a more stressful ground statebefore launch. Thus, the age and stress level of the cell lines before launch make a substantial difference in how the cells respond to the spaceight environment. However, the1108 ZUPANSKA ET AL.very fact that they are different has provided valuable insight into the response that these cellsany cellshave to the novel environment of space. And yet, on this background,these cells also expressed and repressed the genes necessaryto engage in cell-wall remodeling processes that now seem to be a hallmark of spaceight physiological adaptation. 5. Conclusions The results presented here suggest that there is more to understanding spaceight adaptation than identifying genesthat are changed in expression as WT cells adjust to spaceight. There are also genes whose activity at certain levels is required for spaceight adaptation but whose ex-pression levels need not be changed from that which occurs on the ground. Those important but nonchanging genes are revealed by comparing expression patterns between WT andmutant lines. In a very real sense, limiting the list of genesrequired for spaceight adaptation to those that need to be changed only in WT cells can restrict insight into the full scope of the spaceight physiological adaptation process. TheArg1 gene appears to have a major role in spaceight adaptation of cultured cells, perhaps through gravity sens- ing, in these nonspecialized, undifferentiated cells. Themajor ARG1 role seems to relate to its association with the endomembrane system, mediation of the proper localiza- tiontargeting or activity of proteins at the plasma membraneor at organelles of the secretory pathway. These data imply that Arg1 also has a function in spaceight adaptation in differentiated cells within intact plants. Moreover, these datasuggest that the genotype, and therefore the physiologicalstate of a cell, can have a dramatic effect on the expression prole of genes needed for spaceight adaptation. These data also further reinforce the conclusions drawn from a growing body of plant spaceight literature that suggest that at least one underlying theme of the physio- logical adaptation of plants to the spaceight environment iscell-wall remodeling.

In particular the authors appreciate the need and desire of the community (and this paper) to remain dil- igent in the description of experimental results as comparingspaceight samples to ground control samples. Isolating the effects of microgravity from the general and combined effects of spaceight would require the utilization of high-qualitylong-arm centrifuges on orbit. Therefore, the authors strive to specically use the terms spaceight and ground as the terms for the major experimental contrasts in this study.Author Disclosure Statement No competing nancial interests exist.

        "introduction": "Most multicellular organisms have specialized or- gans, structures, cells, and signaling pathways dedi- cated to sensing their environment, such as the gravity-sensingcolumella cells found in the plant root tip (Sato et al., 2015). However, the ability to sense and physiologically adapt to a new environment is not limited to organisms with specialized cellsand organs; undifferentiated plant cells lacking specialization engage a complex response when exposed to an environment without gravity (Paul et al., 2012). Yet the fundamental ques- tion of how an undifferentiated cell senses gravity remainsunanswered. Microgravity experimentation, enabled by the International Space Station (ISS), can essentially remove the effects of this ubiquitous force that affects all life on Earth andprovide unique experimental information about gravity-sensingmechanisms and gravity-based processes, while also describing the physiological changes needed to survive in spaceight (Reaet al., 2016; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Understanding the events of physiological adaptation in undifferentiated cells in spaceight advances fundamental knowledge about how cellsrecognize the gravity stimulus and provides insight as to how gravity-associated signal transduction occurs within a single cell. Both types of insight enhance our ability to prepare forlong-term space exploration. Even though undifferentiated cells and single-celled or- ganisms lack specialized organs for gravity sensing, they areindeed able to detect changes in gravity and are affected by thespaceight environment. In the microgravity of spaceight, cells adapt by making changes to their metabolism that are guided by, and reected in, differential gene expression whencompared to living on the ground (Salmi and Roux, 2008; Paul 1Horticultural Science Department, Program in Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. 2Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. 3Present address: Moftt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.ASTROBIOLOGY Volume 17, Number 11, 2017Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089ast.2016.1538 1077et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Further, undifferentiated cells survive and multiply in space, implying that cells manage to reestablish a favorable physiological equilibrium in micro-gravity (Paul et al., 2012; Fengler et al., 2015). Individual cells can sense and respond to changes in their gravity environment, but the mechanism by which these signals are received and then transduced is poorly understood. Our work with the re-sponse of plants and undifferentiated cell cultures to space- ight revealed a number of potential molecular constituents that may be involved in gravisensing and adaptation tospaceight environments. The approach in the present study was to examine patterns of gene expression in undifferentiated cell lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) developed from wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and from Col-0 plantsdecient in a known gravity-sensing gene: Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1 ). Several reasons contributed to the selection of Arg1 for closer study. Central to the decision was the evidence that Arg1 functions in the early events in gravitropic signal transduction in plant roots (Sedbrook et al., 1998; Blancaor, 2013). During root gravistimulation, ARG1 helps guide the relocalization of membrane-bound auxin efux carrier pro- teinssuch as PIN2 and PIN3to the basal side of the sta-tocytes, which contributes to the establishment of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root cap (Abas et al., 2006; Harrison and Masson, 2008b; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). Although this process has not been demonstrated in non-statocyte cells, ARG1 seems to be well positioned for a role in response to gravity in undifferentiated cells as well. Sev- eral additional characteristics made Arg1 a particularly in- teresting subject with regard to undifferentiated cells. Arg1 is expressed throughout the entire plant; it is not a root-specic gene. Further, ARG1 is not localized to plastids and does notappear to be dependent on mechanisms related to amyloplast movement in specialized cells, such as is typied by PGM, another protein linked to gravitropism (Guan et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009; Morita and Nakamura, 2012). Since specialized cells are absent in the cell cultures, the apparent ability of ARG1 to contribute to gravity sensing without these specializations reinforced its candidacy. In addition, ARG1 islocalized throughout the endosomalsecretory pathway, en- abling it to interact with both vesicular trafcking and inte- gral membrane proteins (Boonsirichai et al., 2003). ARG1 localization cycles along the endomembrane system between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Stanga et al., 2009); thus ARG1 could play a role in gravisensing based on its association with internal cellular structures in the undifferentiated cells. The highly conserved Jdomain at ARG1s N-terminus, a structural hallmark of proteins involved in stress response and signaltransduction (Caplan et al., 1993; Kimura et al., 1995), also supports a gravisignaling role for ARG1 in the cell. The J- domain proteins typically function as molecular co-chaperonesby interacting with HSC70 (Young et al., 2003), and the ARG1HSC70 connection has been made in the TOC complex on the outer chloroplast membrane, where it plays a role inprotein transfer (Jouhet and Gray, 2009; Su and Li, 2010). HSC70 isoform HSP70 is induced by spaceight in several plant systems (reviewed in Schu leret al., 2015), including undifferentiated cells (Paul et al., 2012; Zupanska et al., 2013), strengthening the connection of HSC70 chaperones with gravity sensing and signal transduction. In addition to a Jdo-main, ARG1 also contains a coiled-coil region in its C-terminus that likely enhances its ability to interact with actin in the cytoskeleton (Sedbrook et al., 1999; Boonsirichai et al., 2003; Harrison and Masson, 2008a). The cytoskeleton is central tomany models of single-cell gravity sensing (Ingber, 1999; Vorselen et al., 2014), and actin has been specically impli- cated in gravisensing (Kamada et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2015). Thus ARG1s extensive role in targeted protein distribution, signal transduction, and interaction with cytoskeleton makes it a strong candidate for a role in gravity responses in undiffer-entiated cells. Cell lines from wild-type (WT) Col-0 and an ARG1 knock-out (ARG1 KO) in the same Col-0 background werelaunched to the ISS for the CEL experiment, which was acomponent of the Biological Research In Canisters-17 (BRIC-17) payload. The experiments described here com- pare samples xed in orbit after growth in space to com-parable samples grown in precisely the same hardware on the ground. The focus of the experiment was to evaluate the overall effect of the spaceight environment on these cells. The objective of these experiments was to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of undifferentiated cells to the spaceight environment and, in particular, testthe effect of removing Arg1 , a gene we hypothesized would be a gene of importance to the adaptive process. The utili- zation of this mutant also revealed genes important tospaceight adaptation that would not normally be recog-nized, as they are not differentially regulated by spaceight in WT cells. In the case of these genes, the level at which they are expressed on the ground in WT cells is the levelthat is also required in the physiological adaptation to spaceight, so no differential expression is seen between ground and spaceight in WT cells. However, if the ex-pression levels on the ground are altered for these genes, as can be found in a mutant cell line such as ARG1 KO, then the expression levels must be adjusted to the normal WTlevels to enable spaceight adaptation. Thus the alteredexpression level of these genes is irrelevant for the ground adaptation but is important for the spaceight adaptation. The results of the spaceight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding of ARG1s role in adjusting to this novel environment and have also enabled us to look further into the adaptive process engaged by cells lacking specic, differ-entiated cells and organs for environmental sensing. 2.

        "conclusion": "s The results presented here suggest that there is more to understanding spaceight adaptation than identifying genesthat are changed in expression as WT cells adjust to spaceight. There are also genes whose activity at certain levels is required for spaceight adaptation but whose ex-pression levels need not be changed from that which occurs on the ground. Those important but nonchanging genes are revealed by comparing expression patterns between WT andmutant lines. In a very real sense, limiting the list of genesrequired for spaceight adaptation to those that need to be changed only in WT cells can restrict insight into the full scope of the spaceight physiological adaptation process. TheArg1 gene appears to have a major role in spaceight adaptation of cultured cells, perhaps through gravity sens- ing, in these nonspecialized, undifferentiated cells. Themajor ARG1 role seems to relate to its association with the endomembrane system, mediation of the proper localiza- tiontargeting or activity of proteins at the plasma membraneor at organelles of the secretory pathway. These data imply that Arg1 also has a function in spaceight adaptation in differentiated cells within intact plants. Moreover, these datasuggest that the genotype, and therefore the physiologicalstate of a cell, can have a dramatic effect on the expression prole of genes needed for spaceight adaptation. These data also further reinforce the conclusions drawn from a growing body of plant spaceight literature that suggest that at least one underlying theme of the physio- logical adaptation of plants to the spaceight environment iscell-wall remodeling.

We would like to acknowledge Lisa David for technical assistance and Lawrence Rasmussen for preighttechnical help with the tissue culture cell lines that were used in the BRIC-17 CEL experiment. The authors also wish to acknowledge the large and vari- ous inputs from the community of scientists pushing themolecular biology frontiers of spaceight science. That community includes the reviewers of this manuscript, who helped the authors clarify complex issues of presentation andinterpretation. In particular the authors appreciate the need and desire of the community (and this paper) to remain dil- igent in the description of experimental results as comparingspaceight samples to ground control samples. Isolating the effects of microgravity from the general and combined effects of spaceight would require the utilization of high-qualitylong-arm centrifuges on orbit. Therefore, the authors strive to specically use the terms spaceight and ground as the terms for the major experimental contrasts in this study.Author Disclosure Statement No competing nancial interests exist.
