Microbiome (2017) 5:62 DOI 10.1186s40168-017-0280-8Background Planning future space explorations, involving potential hu- man missions to Mars, would require constructing a safe closed habitat 1, 2. An inflatable lunarMars analog habi- tat (ILMAH) is a unique, simulated closed environment (isolated by HEPA filtration) that can be utilized to over- come challenges associated with both technical and scien- tific issues 3. Because the ILMAH mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and is treated as a proto- type habitat for future space explorations, microbiological characteristics of such a closed environment is of high interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration (NASA). The environmentally controlled ILMAH is an easily accessible system that enables samples to be collected and analyzed at multiple times at relatively low cost. Understanding the microbiome of a closed system and its association with human inhabitation will help to assess the correlation between human health and micro- biome of the habitat as well as the influence of micro- organism on the habitat deterioration 4 6. The highly specialized structure of the simulated ILMAH keeps its inhabitants in isolation from the outside environment. Except for the exchange of the air between outdoor and indoor environments via an advanced envir- onmental control system, the ILMAH mimics the ISS and other future habitats of human explorers on the other planets 3. This unique feature of the ILMAH allows ob- serving the changes in the microbiome during human oc- cupation. The bacteriome of the ILMAH was recently reported 7, as in the case of most of the studies reporting on bacterial microbiomes 8. The molecular fungal diver- sity of Japanese Experimental Module Kibo, on the ISS, revealed abundance of fungi associated with astronauts, but succession of viable fungal population in their habitat was not addressed 9. The skin fungal microbiota of 10 Japanese astronauts showed temporal changes before, dur- ing, and after their stay on the ISS. The molecular fungal diversity associated with various body parts was reduced during the spaceflight when compared to pre-flight data. However, the ratio of Malassezia genetic signatures to all fungal gene copies (including dead fungal cells) increased during their stay at the ISS but the viability of these fungi was not confirmed 10. This is the first report that thor- oughly characterizes the mycobiome of a simulated habi- tat meant for the future human habitats on other planets. Utilization of next generation sequencing (NGS) tech- niques enables more in-depth analysis of indoor micro- biomes 11. Many studies focus on the bacterial microbiome of intensive care units 8, 12 14, pharma- ceutical clean rooms 15 17, or tissue banks 18 since their microbial composition has an impact on human health and life. Nosocomial infections acquired in hospi- tals and other health care facilities remain the sixth lead- ing cause of death in the hospitals in USA 19, 20.Nosocomial infections are mostly caused by various fungal species that belong to the Candida genus and filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus 2123. Therefore, it re- mains important to screen future closed habitats for the presence of opportunistic pathogens that can affect health of immunocompromised astronauts. So far, majority of the indoor microbiome studies have focused on the bac- terial microbiome without analyzing the mycobiome. In addition, those few studies that characterized fungi of in- door environments focused on culture-based populations 2427. In those cases, where new molecular techniques were implemented 28 31 viable fungi were not differen- tiated from the total population (viable and dead) 32. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illu- mina sequencing coupled with the propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment used in this study can determine the viable mycobiome. Fungi are extremophiles that can survive harsh condi- tions such as low nutrient 33, desiccation 34, high low temperatures 35, 36, acidicalkaline 37, 38, radi- ation 39, 40, and other environments 41, 42. Fungal species not only have been isolated from all known envi- ronments on Earth, including barren lands like deserts, caves, or nuclear accident sites, but also are known to be difficult to eradicate from other types of environments including indoor and closed spaces 8, 36, 42, 43. Characterizing and understanding possible changes to, and succession of, fungal species in the ILMAH is of high importance since some of the fungi are extremophiles that are not only potentially hazardous to inhabitants but also can deteriorate the habitat itself 25, 44, 45. It was previ- ously reported that people spending a significant amount of time indoors might suffer from so called sick building syndrome (SBS). SBS is characterized by health- and comfort-related syndromes (e.g., headache, tiredness) that ease after leaving a building. Fatigue and discomfort might be caused not only by physical characteristics of the closed system (humidity, temperature, lighting) but also by bio- logical contamination from both bacteria and fungi 46, 47. Fungal pathogens presence in indoor areas might pose health hazards for people exhibiting immuno- deficiency 48. Pathogenic fungi produce a range of sec- ondary metabolites (SMs) that influence their virulence (e.g., melanins, siderophores, or species-specific toxins), induce allergies, and cause diseases (e.g., aspergillosis, can- didiasis, or cryptococcosis) 48, 49. Prolonged stays in closed habitats (e.g., ILMAH, ISS, etc.) might be stressful for inhabitants and lead to a decrease in immune re- sponse; therefore, assessing the presence of any opportun- istic pathogens is vital 50. Previous reports on the mycobiome in NASA clean rooms and on the ISS documented NGS results from sam- ples collected from various locations, but none of the studies focused on the analysis of the microbial successionBlachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 2 of 16of systematically collected samples 28, 32. The bacterial and archaeal microbiome succession of the ILMAH using NGS has been carried out 7. This is the first report char- acterizing the succession of fungi in a simulated closed system meant for human habitation on other planets util- izing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular tech- niques. In addition, attempts were made during this study to elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of the fungal population and diversity in a closed human habitat. Methods The ILMAH habitat The physical characteristics of the ILMAH, along with de- tailed sampling procedures and periodicity, were previously described 7. In brief, the ILMAH is located in Grand Forks, ND (47.9222 N, 97.0734 W) and has dimensions of 1 2mb y1 0mb y2 . 5m .I tc o n t a i n sas l e e p i n gc o m p a r t - ment, kitchen, toilet, and laboratory area. The ILMAH has its own ventilation system that pressurizes the habitat, pro- vides breathing air for the crew, and removes unwanted material from the air stream. The ILMAH uses a blower that takes ambient air for pressurization and breathing air provision. It provides a positive pressure at 1 PSID (pressure differential) abov e normal atmosphere inside the habitat. The ambient air is pressurized by an industrial fan and sent to a standard HEPA flat panel particulate filter (Bryant GAPBBCAR2025, Honeywell, Morris Plains, NJ). This filter is replaced before each mission lasting up to 30 days. Maintenance personnel changes the filter from the outside. Since the humidity inside the habitat is not re- moved, water vapor during the months when the analog missions takes place range from 35 to 55. Three student crews inhabited the ILMAH for 30 days. During that period of time, there was no exchange be- tween the interior and exterior environment except pumping the air filtered via ILMAH s advanced control- ling system 3. In addition, students did not leave the ILMAH at any time for 30 days, and nothing came in or out, including food, people, water, or any supplies, ex- cept filtered air. Surface samples were collected consecu- tively during four sampling events (day 0 T 0, day 13 T13, day 20 T 20, and day 30 T 30) from eight desig- nated sampling locations. Prior to inhabitation, the ILMAH surfaces were cleaned with 10 bleach and dur- ing the experiment period, it was cleaned weekly with antibacterial wipes. Sampling materials and procedure Samples were collected using biological sampling kits (BiSKits, Quicksilver Analytics Inc., Abingdon, MD) pre- viously documented as an efficient sampling device for surfaces 51. All the BiSKits were prepared following the procedure described elsewhere 7, 51. Briefly, the sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) provided by thedistributor was discarded from the bottle and replaced with 15 mL of sterile UltraPure DNA free PBS (MoBio Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, CA). Each BiSKit was rinsed once with PBS that was later collected into a sterile 15- mL falcon tube and kept at 4 C as a background meas- ure for biological materials associated with macrofoam (sampling device control). This precautionary step was required to overcome, if encountered, microbial contam- ination associated with sampling devices and other pro- cessing reagents. BiSKits prepared as described above were then packed into sterile zip lock bags and shipped at 4 C to the University of North Dakota where they were kept at 4 C till the experiment was carried out (within 2 to 3 days). The ILMAH architecture was previously described 7 (see Additional file 1: Figure SF1, Fig. 1). Surface sam- ples were collected from eight locations at four consecu- tive samplings: day 0 (prior to inhabitation), day 13, day 20, and day 30 during the inhabitation and right before ending the experiment. Originally, sampling activities were scheduled at regular intervals days 0, 10, 20, and 30 of human occupation; however, day 10 sampling scheduled on Thursday was delayed to day 13 (Sunday) to avoid risk related to shipping the samples over the weekend. The work schedule of the ILMAH crew mem- bers was regulated and is detailed in Additional file 2. Each location (surface area 1 m2) was sampled with one BiSKit in three directions following the same steps, hori- zontally from the left to the right, vertically from the bottom to the top, and diagonally from the right bottom corner to the left upper corner. After sampling, the sam- pled BiSKit device was extracted with sterile PBS and sampling fluids were collected in sterile 50-mL falcon tubes. Each BiSKit was washed and extracted twice with the sterile PBS giving approximately 45 mL of uncon- centrated sample. Likewise, the BiSKit left open in the sampling area for the time necessary for sampling one Fig. 1 Picture of the closed habitat from outsideBlachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 3 of 16location was treated as a field control; the unopened BiSKit was treated as a sampling device (BiSKit) control. Collected samples along with the controls were stored at 4 C and sent overnight to JPL via cold shipping for fur- ther analysis. Sample processing for the microbiological analyses was started within 24 h from the sample collection. Sample processing The extruded liquid samples from the BiSKit sampler (45 mL per sample) were concentrated using an Inno- vaPrep Concentrating Pipette (Innova Prep LLC, Drexel, MO) to a final volume of 4 mL. Appropriate aliquots of concentrated samples were further used for cultiva- tion (200 L) and molecular analyses (3 mL). a) Cultivable fungal burden and diversity For cultivation assay, samples were serially diluted by 10 and 100 times. One hundred microliters of each dilution was pour plated in duplicates on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and grown at room temperature (25 C). Colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation, and cultiv- able fungal population was calculated per square meter of the sampling area. Simultaneously, up to 5 colonies exhibiting different morphologies were picked and stored as stab cultures in one-tenth semi-solid PDA medium. Cultivable isolates were identified using primers ITS 1F (5 -CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3 ) and Tw13 (5 -GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG-3 )t h a tt a r g e ts m a l l and large subunit rRNA gene-coding regions of the small and large ribosomal subunit, including the in- ternal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2  52,53. DNA was extracted using freezing ( 80 C) and thaw- ing (80 C) cycle of fungal suspension in PBS for 15 min. This process was repeated 3 times. In some cases when DNA was not extracted by the freezing- thawing method, a PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio) was used according to manufacturer si n - structions. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 C for 30 s, 58 C for 30 s, 72 C for 2 min, and final elongation at 72 C for 10 min. Amplified products were visualized by gel electrophoresis. PCR products were then enzymati- cally purified by using 40 IU of Exonuclease I ( E. coli 20,000 IUmL New England BioLabs, Inc. Ipswich, MA) and 8 IU of Antarctic Phosphatase (5,000 IU mL, New England BioLabs, Inc.) per 20 La m p l i f i c a - tion product. Heat reactions were carried out in a thermocycler as follows: 37 C for 30 min, 80 C for 15 min. Traditional Sanger sequencing was performed at Macrogen (Rockville, MD). The sequences were merged using DNAStar (Madison, WI), identifiedusing UNITE fungal database  54, and aligned using ClustalW. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6.06-mac applying neighbor-joining method 55. Sequences from one representative of each strain and corresponding type strain were used to create the phylogenetic tree. b) DNA extraction The concentrated environmental samples (3 mL) were split into two equal parts. One half of the sample (1.5 mL) was treated with 12.5 Lo f2m M PMA dye (Biotum, Inc., Hayward, CA), and the other half was left untreated. The final concentration of PMA in each treated sample was 25 M. After PMA addition, both treated and untreated samples were kept in the dark for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently exposed to light in the PHaST Blue-Photo activation system for tubes (GenIUL, S.L, Terrassa, Spain) for 15 min. PMA- treated samples represent viable microorganisms whereas the non-PMA-treated samples represent the total number of viable and dead microorganisms 56. After photo activation, each sample was split into two aliquots of 0.75 mL each. One aliquot of each sample was subjected to bead beating for 60 s at 5 ms on the Fastprep-24 bead-beating instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA). The solution after bead beating was combined with not bead-beated ali- quots (1.5 mL), and then used for DNA extraction using the Maxwell-16 MDx automated system follow- ing manufacturer s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Purified DNA was eluted into a final volume of 50L of Ultra Pure molecular water and divided into 4 aliquots that were stored at 80 C. c) Molecular fungal community analysis using Illumina sequencing To determine fungal populations, a two-step amplifi- cation process was applied prior to MiSeq Illumina sequencing at Research and Testing Laboratory (RTL, Lubbock, TX). The forward primer was con- structed with the Illumina i5 sequencing primer (5-TCG TCG GCA GCG TCA GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA CAG-3 ) and the ITS1F primer (5 - CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3 )57. The reverse primer was constructed with the Illu- mina i7 sequencing primer (5 -GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG ACA G- 3) and the ITS2aR primer (5 -GCT GCG TTC TTC ATC GAT GC-3 )58. Amplifications were performed in 25 L reactions with Qiagen Hot- Star Taq master mix (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA), 1L of each 5 Mp r i m e r ,a n d1 L of template. Reactions were performed on ABI Veriti thermo- cyclers (Applied Biosytems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following thermal profile: 95 C for 5 min,Blachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 4 of 16then 25 cycles of 94 C for 30 s, 54 C for 40 s, 72 C for 1 min, followed by one cycle of 72 C for 10 min and 4 C hold. Products from the first stage amplification were added to a second PCR based on qualitatively determined concentrations. Primers for the second PCR were designed based on the Illumina Nextera PCR primers as follows: Forward AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC TAC AC i5index TCG TCG GCA GCG TC and Reverse CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT i7index GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG. The second stage amplification was run the same as the first stage except for 10 cycles. Amplification products were visualized with eGels (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Products were then pooled equimolar, and each pool was size selected in two rounds using Agencourt AMPure XP (BeckmanCoulter, Indianapolis, IN) in a 0.7 ratio for both rounds. Size-selected pools were then quantified using the Quibit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies) and loaded on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) 2  300 flow cell at 10 pM. d) Bioinformatic and statistical analysis of fungal cultivable counts and Illumina sequences To assess the difference between fungal abundances in cultivable sample categories (based on time and location), the following univariate statistical analyses were carried out ( https:www.r-project.org ). The normal distribution of the populations was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and as most were not normally distributed ( pvalue 0.05), we used a Kruskal-Wallis test coupled to a Dunn s test (https:cran.r-project.orgwebpackagesdunn.test index.html ) to investigate differences in the tested populations. Resulting pvalues were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction  59. A total of 8,426,774 raw paired reads were processed with mothur v.1.36.1  60. The 250 bp paired reads were merged by aligning the reads and correcting discordant base calls by requiring one of the base calls to have a Phred quality score at least 6 points higher than the other. Sequences shorter than 200 bp, having more than 8 homopolymers or containing ambiguous base pairs were excluded from the dataset. Subsequently, reads were pre- clustered  61 by combining low-abundant se- quences that differed by 3 or less bases of a more abundant sequence. Chimeric sequences in each sample were identified by UCHIME  62 and also excluded from the dataset. Reads were classified using the ribosomal database project (RDP) classifier II 63 implementation of mothur and UNITE fungal rDNA database  54. Non-fungal sequences weresubsequently removed. ITSx was used to exclude non-ITS sequences from the dataset prior to cluster- ing unaligned sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a distance of 0.03  64u s i n g mother v.1.36.1. The nearest neighbor (single-linkage) algorithm was used for this. OTUs were classified by using the consensus taxonomy of all sequences assigned  60. An in-house R-script employing the libraries vegan, ape, gplots, mgcv, and GUniFrac was used to compare the fungal Illumina data (Additional file 3)65,66. Each dataset consisting of the OTU abundances per sample was rarefied 1000 times to the lowest number of reads, and an average Bray-Curtis distance was calculated. This distance was then utilized to calculate nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) or principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), PERMANOVA (Adonis test), and multi-response permutation pro- cedure (MRPP). In addition, the OTU abundances per sample of each dataset were sum normalized and used to employ either an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Spearman rank correlation on the statistically signifi- cant changing parameters and to generate a heat map (pvalue 0.05). The change of diversity was measured via the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. OTUs that were unclassified at phylum level were removed. Heat maps were presented at family level. Results Cultivable fungal burden and diversity The culture-based fungal abundance of the ILMAH was estimated for each sampling location with colony-forming unit (CFU) values ranging from below detection limit (BDL) to 104CFUm2(Additional file 4: Table ST1a). The highest abundance of the cultivable fungi was observed during the first sampling (T 0) followed by 1 log decrease in CFU during consecutive sampling events (T 13,T20,T30) for each living compartment. High fungal population was noticed in samples collected at T 0(Fig. 2A). When statisti- cally treated, the change in fungal abundance within dif- ferent time points was significant (T 0T20p 0.008 and T0T30p 0.0125) (Additional file 5: Table ST2a). The cultivable fungal population for the lab area was higher than observed in other compartments (Fig. 2B, Additional file 4: Table ST1b). A statistically significant difference was observed between the lab area and the bedroom ( p 0.0021) (Additional file 5: Table ST2b). One hundred seventeen cultivable isolates were col- lected and identified targeting the ITS region. Screening sequences against the UNITE fungal database enabled identification of 32 species (Fig. 3). Among the cultivable isolates, only five strains had similarity lower than 97 that did not allow identification to the species level. All of the identified species but one HydnopolyporusBlachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 5 of 16fimbriatus belong to the Ascomycota division (Fig. 3). The most abundant cultivable species were Cladosporium cladosporioides (16), Epicoccum nigrum (15), Aspergillus tubingensis (13), Aspergillus fumigatus (8), Alternaria tenuissima (7), and Pennicillium brevicompactum (7).P. brevicompactum was the only, out of the most commonly identified species, that was not present at multiple time points but only at T 13sampling (Fig. 3). Abundance of C. cladosporioides colonies increased during the ILMAH occupation whereas the abundance of E. nigrum, A. tubin- gensis ,a n d A. tenuissima decreased. Another commonly isolated species, A. fumigatus , was not isolated during the last sampling event. Neither field nor sampling device controls showed cultivable isolates. Viable and total mycobiome (iTag Illumina-based analysis) The fungal richness of PMA-treated (viable) samples de- creased when compared to untreated samples (dead and alive). In PMA-untreated samples, 98 families were de- tected, whereas OTUs belonging to 41 of these families were not viable. Moreover, both PMA-treated and PMA- untreated samples differed sig nificantly in community rela- tionships (NMDS analysis in Fig. 4, Adonis pvalue  0.006 and MRPP, significance of delta  0.002; A 0.0419) and their Shannon diversity index indicated a significant reduc- tion (paired Ttestp 0.0000012) in viable fungal diversity. Observed differences in the P MA-treated (Fig. 4a, c) and PMA-untreated samples (Fig. 4b, d) indicate that untreated samples are overestimating th e observed fungi. This obser- vation was further confirmed when alpha diversity of cultiv- able, viable, and total mycobiome was plotted over time (Fig. 5). In this research communication, only viable myco- biome was considered and discussed in detail. Illumina- based reads of sampling device and field controls showed negligible signal from DNA c ontamination and hence not included in the following analysis. Viable fungal community structure The most abundant phylum that dominated the viable mycobiome of the ILMAH was Ascomycota (90 of all characterized OTUs) followed by Basidiomycota and un- classified fungi (4 and 5, respectively). Incidence of the fungal OTUs at the family level for various time points and locations are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The dominant Pleosporaceae (75 of all OTUs) along with unclassified fungi (5) and Davidiel- laceae (4) constituted 84 of all OTUs present in PMA-treated samples (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 6). A closer look into the genus level of Pleosporaceae family indicated the domination of Epicoccum (92.95 of all OTUs) and Alternaria (6.8) sequences. The dominant fungal OTUs in the ILMAH biome correspond with the most frequently isolated cultivable fungi (Figs. 3 and 6).a b Fig. 2 Statistical analysis of cultivable fungal diversity detected through the 30-day habitation period at all the locations based on colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. To assess the difference between fungal abundances in cultivable sample categories (based on time A and location B), we applied the following univariate statistics. The normal distribution of the populations were tested using Shapiro- Wilk normality test, and as most of them were not normally distributed (pvalue 0.05), we used a Kruskal-Wallis test coupled to a Dunn st e s t to investigate differences in the tested populations. Resulting pvalues were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. ACFU counts before crew occupation T 0awere statistically different from CFU counts at T 20and T 30b, but no statistical difference was observed between T 0and T 13counts ab. Additionally, no statistical differences were observed between any other time points. BCFU counts in the bedroom a, differed significantly from the CFU counts in lab b, but no statistical differences were observed between bedroom and kitchen or toilet ab. No statistical differences were observed between any other locationsBlachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 6 of 16Differences in the fungal community between samples were analyzed by multivariate statistics using ordination analyses and Monte Carlo-based permutation tests. Viable fungal communities showed similar mycobiome profiles throughout the sampling period except from the samples collected at T 20, which were distinct (Fig. 4; Adonis p value  0.001 and MRPP , significance of delta  0.001 and A 0.1168, Additional file 6: Figure SF2 MRPP: chance corrected within-group agreement A: 0.1626, significance of delta 0.001; Adonis: delta  0.019). Interestingly, com- munity profiles were similar between samples collected before crew occupation (T 0) and at T 13and T 30(Add- itional file 7: Figure SF3; chance corrected within-group agreement A: 0.01802, significance of delta: 0.219, Adonis 0.228, Additional file 8: Table ST3).Observed differences in multivariate statistics led to the investigation of mycobiome changes on a single- OTU level. First, an Anova test carried out on samples that did not cluster with the rest (Fig. 4) showed pres- ence of representatives of Pleosporaceae ,Pleosporales , Saccharomycetales ,Tremellales , and Trichocomaceae families. Second, throughout the inhabitation, the level ofPleosporaceae showed significant fluctuation from 96 to 47 and 70 at T 0,T 20, and T 30, respectively (Fig. 7). Additionally, while Pleosporaceae presence de- creased to 47, a significant increase in the levels of Davidiellaceae (22), Dothioraceae (11), Saccharomy- cetales (8), and Trichocomaceae (8) was observed when compared to other time points (Fig. 6, Additional file 9: Table ST4). Interestingly, the presence of lessFig. 3 Cultivable fungal diversity detected through the 30-day habitation perio d at all the locations based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence s. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neigh bor-joining method (bootstrap 1000). In total, 117 isolates were collected 113 of which were succe ssfully sequenced (4 strains either did not show growth or did not respond to the seque ncing methods attempted). The numbering of the isolates is explained as follows: F  fungi, first number (0 4) will be the sample collection day (0  T 0,2T 13,3T 20,4T 30), second number (1 8) will be sampling location, and the third number (1 5) is the replicate number of the isolate. For example, F23-02 will be a fungal strain, isolated from T 20, at location number 3 and a second isolate. Frequency of isolates is given as a frequency bar after the name of fungus.

Further investigation of OTU abundances on the genus level revealed changes in OTU counts over the course of time. The numbers of OTUs identified as Epiccocum , Alternaria ,Pleosporales ,a n d Cryptococcus fluctuated from high abundance at T 0to significantly lower counts at T 20 and then counts increased again at T 30. OTUs identified asDavidiella increased throughout the occupation time whereas OTU counts for Aspergillus ,Aureobasidium ,a n d Candida were increasing over time (peak at T 20)w i t ha drastic decrease at T 30. Location wise before the ILMAH occupation, all compartments exhibited high abundance ofEpiccocum OTUs that decreased over time and againincreased at T 30.Alternaria OTUs were less abundant than the ones identified as Epiccocum genus. Nevertheless, they showed the same fluctuation pattern in all compart- ments but bedroom. While accumulation of Davidiella OTU counts was observed in bedroom and lab, the OTU counts in the bathroom did not differ between the T 0and T30. At the same time, accumulation of Davidiella OTUs was observed in the kitchen with the highest abundance during the T 20sampling event. To sum up, statistical analysis revealed differences in community structure between time points in particular between T 20and any other previous or following time point. Davidiellaceae ,Teratosphaeriaceae ,Tremellales_3 , Pleosporales , and Pleosporaceae families were shown toTable 1 Incidence of the fungal OTUs at the family level for various time points Fungal phylumFungal family Number of sequences T0 T13 T20 T30 Total Viable Total Viable Total Viable Total Viable Ascomycota Botryosphaeriales 115 31 1620 176 96 Capnodiales 2 185 121 61 4353 Chaetomiaceae 2415 1089 5533 1505 32981 Cucurbitariaceae 451 221 2298 750 1879 2272 1256 Davidiellaceae 2840 1423 42496 6099 129620 28495 55079 38510 Dothioraceae 32 104 510 289 12864 14785 4726 688 Hypocreaceae 174 68 2357 197 5510 3897 10952 Hypocreales 73 86 9247 402 8566 1 7989 5638 Leptosphaeriaceae 16 23 564 215 518 1 1639 1 Lophiostomataceae 56 43 56 1850 1 26 Microascaceae 326 27007 9 735 6 Montanulaceae 627 232 11273 621 22582 12697 77 Nectriaceae 82 121 2890 1287 8479 804 2242 49 Phaeosphaeriaceae 343 222 3551 105 6082 1 6969 30695 Pleosporaceae 295115 380533 273232 251840 172919 61791 648825 619794 Pleosporales 5202 3071 6876 4475 10056 13 12085 8859 Saccharomycetales 17 33 346 3 45461 10414 17840 2092 Sclerotiniaceae 52 16 355 1920 99 Teratosphaeriaceae 35 28 805 1 2 2 583 44749 Trichocomaceae 68 32 10496 3461 14625 10495 12147 518 Trichosphaeriales 3 122 1750 688 Unclassified 712 686 5082 640 4161 4450 6317 Basidiomycota Filobasidiaceae 1164 419 5997 8 11570 1925 2550 4425 Peniophoraceae 1 10916 Polyporales 1 1339 Sporidiobolales 2563 1236 6556 315 22900 2 35692 24352 Tremellales 7916 4158 42068 1030 72870 9 34932 18439 Unclassified 409 272 2151 2171 481 504 2445 279 Unclassified Unclassified 2973 10475 38015 17311 30832 10320 41608 53950Blachowicz et al.

Discussion Understanding microbial characteristic of a controlled habitat, like the ILMAH, may facilitate discerning the microbial population dynamics as well as the develop- ment of appropriate countermeasures. Knowledge about the viable mycobiome will not only allow the develop- ment of required maintenance and cleaning procedures in the closed habitat but also prevent it from deteriorat- ing and being a potential health hazard for its inhabi- tants 67. Multiple studies have shown that use of propidium monoazide (PMA), a dye that can penetrate the compromised cell walls, enables more accurate ana- lysis of the viable microbiome 68, 69. It was also shownthat PMA treatment might be successfully applied to de- termine dead and viable counts for various fungal spe- cies 70, 71. As in this study, other report proved that DNA from dead cells, when not removed from samples, before molecular analyses, might overshadow the actual diversity since presence of less abundant microbial spe- cies were masked 32. PMA-treated and PMA- untreated samples varied significantly in the ILMAH fungal community structures ( pvalue  0.006), and it had been reported before that low abundant species were detected in PMA-treated samples for bacteria, fungi, and viruses 66. This approach validated the im- portance of PMA treatment to accurately determine the viable mycobiome of environmental samples. As a result, this study discussed only viable fungal communities to determine succession patterns and community structure over the course of time.Table 2 Incidence of the fungal OTUs at the family level for locations Fungal phylumFungal family Number of sequences Bedroom Kitchen Bathroom Lab Total Viable Total Viable Total Viable Total Viable Ascomycota Capnodiales 215 26 121 5 4355 Chaetomiaceae 171 32858 1668 2073 5541 1212 Cucurbitariaceae 1186 16 2782 739 1248 57 1545 1415 Davidiellaceae 71145 17039 40120 35104 53460 496 58969 21888 Dothioraceae 4821 5774 161 286 172 9708 12970 98 Herpotrichiellaceae 68 4 93 4 134 7 1407 28 Hypocreaceae 979 11 4622 93 2095 10909 4133 204 Hypocreales 9471 5617 8792 408 1712 12 5169 90 Lophiostomataceae 30 21 71 19 9 1878 4 Microascaceae 3086 3 6642 3 18317 3 23 6 Montanulaceae 9231 116 5112 520 24292 68 7141 226 Nectriaceae 216 1374 5618 3 1542 18 6177 866 Phaeosphaeriaceae 1360 131 4209 55 6150 18 4318 30819 Pleosporaceae 223517 357893 195638 299314 247789 199402 626137 457349 Pleosporales 5933 4284 6768 590 7339 644 10668 10900 Saccharomycetales 1904 1658 18978 10681 10035 49 29496 154 Teratosphaeriaceae 94 55 9 13 8 932 44763 Trichocomaceae 5453 1 11611 1167 8735 2236 10860 11102 Others (20) 1835 5 494 12 530 16 365 26 Unclassified 2007 426 5203 468 668 3105 5831 3644 Basidiomycota Filobasidiaceae 3624 2198 935 120 8171 4412 8259 47 Peniophoraceae 45 9922 79 1 994 Polyporales 1 1339 Sporidiobolales 33860 24869 15193 173 10398 299 7923 564 Tremellales 47729 17080 26291 2479 9002 1165 69144 2912 Unclassified 1999 34 525 2172 1144 67 1459 953 Unclassified Unclassified 37959 13825 17047 26040 22401 6260 29713 45931Blachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 10 of 16Various studies showed the positive correlation be- tween changes in the indoor bacteriome and human presence 7, 28, 30, 66, 72 whereas such observation was not confirmed for the mycobiome 29, 30, 73. Major sources of indoor microbiome were reported to be associated with human skin commensals transmitted via shoes, clothes, coughing, and talking 74, 75. It was also shown that the indoor mycobiome was mostly influ- enced by airborne fungi rather than human presence and their shedding, despite the fact that fungi were associated with human skin, lungs, urogenital tract, oral nasal cav- ities, and the gut 30, 76 79. In addition, few studies demonstrated that key determinants for mycobiome in- doors might be the age of the built-in environments and the relative humidity, which can enhance fungal growth 80. A recent 6-month survey on Japanese astronauts on the ISS revealed that the most abundant (dead or alive) fungal genus was Malassezia 10 whereas in this study, the most frequent viable fungal genera of closed habitat were Epiccocum ,Alternaria ,a n d Pleosporales , which are environmental organisms rather than human commensals. The presence of fungi inside the closed habitat, houses, or any types of man-made buildings was corre- lated with the amount of the water (relative humidity; RH) present in the environment 80. The environmental relative moldiness index (ERMI) increases with elevated amounts of water 81. The most abundant genera in common households were Alternaria ,Cladosporium , andEpicoccum whereas Aspergillus andPenicillium were predominant in water-damaged building 81. Similarly, in this study (measured RH 32 to 55), the most abun- dant fungal genera were Epiccocum ,Alternaria ,Pleos- porales ,a n d Cryptococcus , which could be comparedwith the previous observations for common households. Nevertheless, genera present in houses and closed habitats could have an impact on human health. These molds were associated with allergies and asthma 67, 82. Elevated level of fungal allergenic molecules, such as enzymes, toxins, cell-wall components, and cross- reactive proteins could induce type I hypersensitivity 67. Additionally, because of their ability to colonize the human body and produce toxins, volatile organic com- pounds, and proteases, the common molds ( Alternaria , Cladosporium ,Epicoccum ) could damage airways of im- munocompromised occupants, which make them more dangerous than any other allergenic source 82 85. In this study, accumulation of Alternaria and Epicoccum genera over time was observed, which, in combination with reported decreased immunity in occupants of con- fined spaces, e.g., astronauts 50, 86 could lead to devel- oping allergy and asthma symptoms. Throughout this study, the abundance of dominant Pleosporaceae family members decreased (94 at T 0to 71 at T 30), while other fungal families were observed to increase, possibly as a result of human presence. However, positive correlation between increased fungal diversity and human presence requires studying the mycobiome of the occupants. It might be possible that the implemented cleaning procedures including weekly dusting, sweeping, wet mopping the floor, and antibac- terial wipes resulted in suppressed growth of Pleospora- ceae members over the time. The community structure observed at T 20was distinct from other time points. De- tailed logging data collected during 30-day mission did not show any abnormal accidents or cleaning activities preceding T 20sampling. The recorded data indicated Fig. 6 Dominant fungal population and succession patterns observed in 30-day occupation period of the ILMAH system. The OTUs presented in the bar graph are the most abundant. T 20surface samples show different fungal profile when compared to other time points. T 30samples show increase in fungal diversity when compared to other time pointBlachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 11 of 16that cleaning was conducted between the sampling events (4 5 days prior to sampling). However, the inhabiting crew might have inadvertently cleaned just prior to T 20sampling and that might have removed both total and viable fungal populations (Table 1). The signifi- cant increase of Davidiellaceae (22), Dothioraceae (11), Saccharomycetales (8), and Trichocomaceae (8) sequences at T 20might be due to the fact that under-represented members became available for PCR reaction among the competing dominant fungal DNA. Both Cladosporium sp. members of Davidiellaceae family and Aurobasidium sp. of Dothioraceae family have the capacity to survive extreme environments like the ice of the Antarctica 87 or radioactive explosionsite of Chernobyl Power Plant accident 88. Addition- ally, Cladosporium sp. and Aureobasidium pullulans were isolated from hypersaline waters with NaCl con- centration reaching 25 indicating high osmotolerance 89, 90. Penicillium sp. of Trichocomaceae family iso- lated from high-altitude soil in Indian Himalaya has been shown to tolerate a wide range of pH from 2 to 14 and a salt concentration between 10 and 20 91. Most of the Apergillus sp. of Trichocomaceae family is soil fungi or saprophytes 92, but there has been a recent report of isolation of A. fumigatus from ISS 32.

All in all, the capacity to survive in such extreme environments might help the observed in the study Davidiellaceae ,Dothioraceae , and Trichocomaceae species to adjust and survive hostile conditions of the ILMAH. Conclusions Accumulation of viable mycobiome during the experiment duration and differences in fu ngal community profiles were observed. On a genus level, Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleos- porales, Davidiella ,a n d Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupati on time. Unlike results of molecular analyses, cultivable fungi counts decreased over time. Epicoccum nigrum was the most dominant cultivable isolate; however, most of the fungal species detected via molecular approach were not cultured. During human presence, the overall fungal diversity has changed, that in the long run, may lead to a conclusion that proper main- t e n a n c ep r o t o c o l so fac l o s e dh a b i t a tm a yb er e q u i r e dt o preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants.Additional files Additional file 1: Figure SF1.

        "conclusion": "s: The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum ,Alternaria , Pleosporales ,Davidiella , and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time.

Microbiome (2017) 5:62 DOI 10.1186s40168-017-0280-8Background Planning future space explorations, involving potential hu- man missions to Mars, would require constructing a safe closed habitat 1, 2. An inflatable lunarMars analog habi- tat (ILMAH) is a unique, simulated closed environment (isolated by HEPA filtration) that can be utilized to over- come challenges associated with both technical and scien- tific issues 3. Because the ILMAH mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and is treated as a proto- type habitat for future space explorations, microbiological characteristics of such a closed environment is of high interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration (NASA). The environmentally controlled ILMAH is an easily accessible system that enables samples to be collected and analyzed at multiple times at relatively low cost. Understanding the microbiome of a closed system and its association with human inhabitation will help to assess the correlation between human health and micro- biome of the habitat as well as the influence of micro- organism on the habitat deterioration 4 6. The highly specialized structure of the simulated ILMAH keeps its inhabitants in isolation from the outside environment. Except for the exchange of the air between outdoor and indoor environments via an advanced envir- onmental control system, the ILMAH mimics the ISS and other future habitats of human explorers on the other planets 3. This unique feature of the ILMAH allows ob- serving the changes in the microbiome during human oc- cupation. The bacteriome of the ILMAH was recently reported 7, as in the case of most of the studies reporting on bacterial microbiomes 8. The molecular fungal diver- sity of Japanese Experimental Module Kibo, on the ISS, revealed abundance of fungi associated with astronauts, but succession of viable fungal population in their habitat was not addressed 9. The skin fungal microbiota of 10 Japanese astronauts showed temporal changes before, dur- ing, and after their stay on the ISS. The molecular fungal diversity associated with various body parts was reduced during the spaceflight when compared to pre-flight data. However, the ratio of Malassezia genetic signatures to all fungal gene copies (including dead fungal cells) increased during their stay at the ISS but the viability of these fungi was not confirmed 10. This is the first report that thor- oughly characterizes the mycobiome of a simulated habi- tat meant for the future human habitats on other planets. Utilization of next generation sequencing (NGS) tech- niques enables more in-depth analysis of indoor micro- biomes 11. Many studies focus on the bacterial microbiome of intensive care units 8, 12 14, pharma- ceutical clean rooms 15 17, or tissue banks 18 since their microbial composition has an impact on human health and life. Nosocomial infections acquired in hospi- tals and other health care facilities remain the sixth lead- ing cause of death in the hospitals in USA 19, 20.Nosocomial infections are mostly caused by various fungal species that belong to the Candida genus and filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus 2123. Therefore, it re- mains important to screen future closed habitats for the presence of opportunistic pathogens that can affect health of immunocompromised astronauts. So far, majority of the indoor microbiome studies have focused on the bac- terial microbiome without analyzing the mycobiome. In addition, those few studies that characterized fungi of in- door environments focused on culture-based populations 2427. In those cases, where new molecular techniques were implemented 28 31 viable fungi were not differen- tiated from the total population (viable and dead) 32. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illu- mina sequencing coupled with the propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment used in this study can determine the viable mycobiome. Fungi are extremophiles that can survive harsh condi- tions such as low nutrient 33, desiccation 34, high low temperatures 35, 36, acidicalkaline 37, 38, radi- ation 39, 40, and other environments 41, 42. Fungal species not only have been isolated from all known envi- ronments on Earth, including barren lands like deserts, caves, or nuclear accident sites, but also are known to be difficult to eradicate from other types of environments including indoor and closed spaces 8, 36, 42, 43. Characterizing and understanding possible changes to, and succession of, fungal species in the ILMAH is of high importance since some of the fungi are extremophiles that are not only potentially hazardous to inhabitants but also can deteriorate the habitat itself 25, 44, 45. It was previ- ously reported that people spending a significant amount of time indoors might suffer from so called sick building syndrome (SBS). SBS is characterized by health- and comfort-related syndromes (e.g., headache, tiredness) that ease after leaving a building. Fatigue and discomfort might be caused not only by physical characteristics of the closed system (humidity, temperature, lighting) but also by bio- logical contamination from both bacteria and fungi 46, 47. Fungal pathogens presence in indoor areas might pose health hazards for people exhibiting immuno- deficiency 48. Pathogenic fungi produce a range of sec- ondary metabolites (SMs) that influence their virulence (e.g., melanins, siderophores, or species-specific toxins), induce allergies, and cause diseases (e.g., aspergillosis, can- didiasis, or cryptococcosis) 48, 49. Prolonged stays in closed habitats (e.g., ILMAH, ISS, etc.) might be stressful for inhabitants and lead to a decrease in immune re- sponse; therefore, assessing the presence of any opportun- istic pathogens is vital 50. Previous reports on the mycobiome in NASA clean rooms and on the ISS documented NGS results from sam- ples collected from various locations, but none of the studies focused on the analysis of the microbial successionBlachowicz et al. Microbiome (2017) 5:62 Page 2 of 16of systematically collected samples 28, 32. The bacterial and archaeal microbiome succession of the ILMAH using NGS has been carried out 7. This is the first report char- acterizing the succession of fungi in a simulated closed system meant for human habitation on other planets util- izing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular tech- niques. In addition, attempts were made during this study to elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of the fungal population and diversity in a closed human habitat.",
