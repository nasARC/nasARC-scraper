Keywords Aspergillus fumigatus ; proteome; the International Space Station 1. INTRODUCTION The International Space Station (ISS) is a man-made closed habitat that functions as a platform to study the impact of the distinct space environment, which includes enhanced irradiation and microgravity on humans17, animals8,9, plants1014 and microorganisms1519. Most experiments conducted on board the ISS are precisely planned. Studied organisms are intentionally sent to the ISS to investigate the possible alterations in their physiology, using ground controls for comparison. However, one on-going ISS Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO) experiment focuses on studying hitchhikers that have followed humans and cargo aboard the ISS20. Thorough investigation of microbiological characteristics of closed habitats, like the ISS, are indispensable to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as manned long-term space flight missions are within reach. A deeper understanding of microbes that coexist in closed habitats with humans remains imperative to astronauts health and the overall maintenance of closed systems. Strict scrutiny of the microbiome and mycobiome of the ISS2025, Mir26,27, and Skylab28, in the past, has revealed prevalence of fungal genera: Cladosporium , Penicillium , and Aspergillus in space environments. These fungi can be both beneficial and detrimental to mankind, as they produce a myriad of commercially useful bioactive compounds2934, while also causing allergies35, infections36,37 and biodeterioration of habitats3840. Aspergillus fumigatus , one of many fungal isolates identified in a recent ISS-MO study22, is a ubiquitous saprophytic fungus41. Its enormous adaptation capacity enables it to not only be omnipresent in the environment, but also to be a successful opportunistic pathogen42. A. fumigatus causes variety of health conditions spanning from allergies to potentially life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised individuals43,44. Initial characterization of two A. fumigatus ISS-isolates, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, showed no outstanding differences in their genomes and secondary metabolites profiles when compared to clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293, however both isolates were significantly more lethal in a larval zebra fish model of IA45. Considering that A. fumigatus becomes more virulent in space and therefore potentially more dangerous to astronauts health, it was pertinent to further investigate molecular changes of ISS-isolated strains. Presented in this study are the unique differences observed in proteome of two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, when compared to Af293 and CEA10. The goal of this study was to understand if the distinct environment of the ISS (low-nutrients, enhanced irradiation and microgravity) alters the proteome of A. fumigatus . Due to an existing gap in our understanding of how filamentous fungi molecularly adapt to space Blachowicz et al. Page 2 Fungal Genet Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 18. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptconditions, proteome investigation of these two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains was prudent. 2. METHODS 2.1. Isolation and identification of A. fumigatus. Procedures to isolate and identify A. fumigatus collected from the ISS were described previously45. In brief, HEPA filter associated particulates were scraped, resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and spread onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates22. Cupola surfaces were sampled with sterile polyester wipes assembled at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) prior to space flight. After each sampling event on board the ISS, wipes were returned to JPL for subsequent processing. During that process, two of multiple isolates were identified via ITS region and subsequently whole genome sequencing (WGS) as A. fumigatus . 2.2. Growth conditions. Af293, CEA10, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 were cultivated for 5 days at 30C on glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates (6 gL NaNO 3, 0.52 gL KCl, 0.52 gL MgSO 47H2O, 1.52 gL KH 2PO4, 10 gL D-glucose, 15 gL agar supplemented with 1 mLL of Hutners trace elements) covered with cellophane membrane. Each Petri plate (D10 cm) was inoculated with 10106 sporesplate. For supplementary comparison, each strain was also cultured in potato-dextrose (PD, BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Czapek-dox (CD, BD Difco) liquid media for 2 days and 10 days, respectively. 2.3. Protein extraction. Mycelia and spores from GMM agar plates were collected. The hyphae from the liquid media were collected on Whatman paper filter and washed with cell culture grade water. All samples were stored at 80 C prior to protein extraction. The lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 200 g phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The hyphae from the liquid media were first homogenized on ice using a Polytron (Kinematica AG, Bohemia, NY) with a speed setting of 5 for 35 times (1 mintime, 30 sec pause). Subsequently, the crude homogenates were subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2 mL cryotube with 0.5 mm glass beads three times (at 4 C, 6500 rpm, 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15 sec pauses in between). Mycelia from GMM were homogenized directly by bead beating due to their small volume. The lysed fungi were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA). 2.4. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. 200 g proteins from each group were TCA-precipitated. Obtained protein pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone, and resolubilized in 25 L TEAB (100 mM) and 25 L 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Subsequently, proteins were reduced with tris(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 500 mM), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested Blachowicz et al. Page 3 Fungal Genet Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 18. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptovernight using mass spec grade trypsinlysC (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Scientific). 40 g of peptides from each specific sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit (Af293 with TMT6-126, CEA10 with TMT6-127, ISSFT-021 with TMT6-128, and IF1SW-F4 with TMT6-130) according to the manufacturers protocol. The TMT6-131 label was used as a reference that contained an equal amount of peptides from each of the samples. All labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated into eight fractions using the Thermo Scientific Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit. The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and re-suspended in 1 (vv) formic acid prior to LC-MSMS analysis. 2.5. LC-MSMS analysis. An Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with the Thermo EASY-nLC ion source, 75 m  2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and 75 m  25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column was used to analyze the samples. Peptides were eluted at 45C with a flow rate of 300 nLmin over a 110 min gradient, from 330 solvent B (100 min), 3050 solvent B (3 min), 5090 solvent B (2 min), and 90 solvent B (2 min). The solvent A was 0.1 formic acid in water and the solvent B was 0.1 formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (mz 4001500) was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2105 in the Orbitrap with the 50 ms maximum injection time for MS scans. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected for fragmentation with charge states 27, within a 10 ppm mass window, using a 70 s dynamic exclusion function. MS2 scans (mz 4002000) were performed using the linear ion trap with the 35 CID collision energy. The ion trap scan rate was set to rapid, with an AGC target of 4103, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Subsequently, ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were subjected to an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (mz 100500) generated the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a 55 collision energy, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms. 2.6. Proteome data processing. The Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81, Thermo Scientific) with searching engines Sequest-HT against an A. fumigatus Af293 protein database from NCBI containing 9845 non-redundant sequences was used to search all MSMS spectra. The following parameters: 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses were selected. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues, whereas dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT6plex modification of lysine -amino groups and peptide N-termini, and acetyl modification of peptide N- terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target-decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the co-isolation threshold was 75. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reporter peaks was greater than 10. The sum of all detected reporter ions of associated peptides from a protein was used to determine the total intensity of a reporter ion for that protein. The ratios between reporter and the reference reporter ions (TMT6131) were used to estimate Blachowicz et al. Page 4 Fungal Genet Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 18. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe abundance ratio of each protein. For the statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was Log2 transformed and technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all three technical replicates, were considered for the analysis. One-way ANOV A was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed. Proteins with p-value  0.05 were further evaluated for up- and down-regulation using a cut-off value of  1 fold (Log2) change. 3. RESULTS 3.1. Proteome analysis overview. Proteins with altered abundance in ISS-isolated strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, and clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10, were investigated upon extraction of total protein from each strain. Extracted proteins were digested into peptides and labeled using tandem mass tags (TMT), fractionated, and analyzed via LC-MSMS followed by spectrumsequence matching using A. fumigatus Af293 protein database (NCBI). The abundance ratios of all identified proteins were normalized to Af293, that enabled identification of 553, 464 and 626 increased and 314, 289 and 317 decreased in abundance proteins in CEA10, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 strains respectively (Table S-1, Figure S-1). When compared to both, Af293 and CEA10, 60 proteins showed increased and 32 decreased abundance in space strains only (fold change (FC)  2) (Table S-2). AspGD GO Slim terms46 were used to study the distribution of differentially abundant proteins in space strains. Analysis of proteins with increased abundance revealed involvement of 14 proteins in carbohydrate metabolic processes, eight in stress responses, five in secondary metabolism and toxins biosynthesis, and two in pathogenesis whereas five, three, one and zero proteins showed respectively decreased abundance in these categories. Proteins associated with cellular amino acid metabolic process (6), lipid cellular homeostasis (3), metabolic processes (2), pathogenesis (2), and translation (2) exhibited increased abundance in space strains only (Figure 1). FungiDB47 was used to carry out GO term enrichment analysis to gain a general understanding of biological processes possibly affected by unique environment of the ISS. The results revealed that significantly over-represented up-regulated biological processes included secondary metabolic processes (40 of all up-regulated proteins), carbohydrate metabolic processes (23), and response to chemical (15), whereas significantly over- represented down-regulated processes included carbohydrate metabolic processes (15), response to heat (6), and mRNA metabolic processes (6) (Table S-3). 3.2. Secondary metabolism and toxins. The proteomic analysis revealed altered abundance of proteins involved in secondary metabolism (Table 1). Proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, including emodin O-methyltransferase TpcA (AFUA_4G14580), glutathione S-transferase TpcF (AFUA_4G14530), and dehydratase TpcK (AFUA_4G14470)4850, were at least threefold more abundant in ISS-isolated strains than in clinical isolates. Arp1 (AFUA_2G17580), a scytalone dehydratase involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis5153 was threefold more abundant, whereas Asp-hemolysin (Asp-HS; AFUA_3G00590)54 was eight times more abundant in ISS strains.Blachowicz et al. Page 5 Fungal Genet Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 18. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptTo confirm observed up-regulation of proteins involved in the trypacidin biosynthesis secondary metabolite profiles of the clinical and ISS isolates were acquired using high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectroscopy (HPL- DAD-MS) analysis. Examination of the production yields of monomethylsulochrin, the final intermediate in trypacidin biosynthesis, (trypacidin is not detectable until 78 days of growth50) showed 600 and 200 increased production in ISSFT-021 ad IF1SW-F4, respectively (Figure S-2). Additionally, proteome of clinical and ISS strains was examined in liquid CD and PD media and confirmed significant up-regulation of AspHS (Table S-4). Lastly, observed differences in sporulation capacity between the strains do not seem to be directly correlated with conidiaassociated protein expression levels (Figure S-3), suggesting that the observed variations are due to exposure to space environment rather than different growth rates. 3.3. Stress response. Among proteins with altered abundance, 11 were involved in the stress response of A. fumigatus (Table 2). AFUA_5G11430, a quinone oxidoreductase, and Pst2 (AFUA_1G02820), an NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, involved in oxidative stress response were three and four times more abundant in space strains. Erythromycin esterase, AFUA_1G05850, and 3 exoribonuclease AFUA_2G1598056 were at least twofold more abundant in ISS strains. Among proteins with decreased abundance several were heat shock proteins including Scf1 (AFUA_1G17370)57,58, and Awh11 (AFUA_6G12450)56. Other down-regulated protein was dehydrin-like protein DprA (AFUA_4G00860) that is known to play a role in oxidative stress response59. 3.4. Carbohydrate metabolic processes. Comparative analysis of proteomes of ISS-isolated strains, IF1SW-F4 and ISST-021, with clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293 revealed changes in abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes (Table 3). Pyruvate decarboxylase PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), which catalyzes the first step in anaerobic conversion of pyruvate to ethanol60, was about three times more abundant in space strains when compared to clinical isolates. Proteins involved in glycerol metabolism, including glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730), and glycerol kinase AFUA_4G1154055 were at least 2.5-fold more abundant in ISS-isolated strains. AFUA_5G10540 and AFUA_1G02140, which are homologues of A. niger An14g04190 and GdbA (An01g06120)61, respectively, and involved in glycogen biosynthesis and metabolism were at least twofold more abundant. Protein abundance of AFUA_3G08470, AFUA_4G08880, AFUA_7G_01830, and AFUA_1G14710 involved in glucose metabolism, increased twofold at minimum. Both, the 143-3 family protein ArtA (AFUA_2G03290)62 and malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540)63 were threefold more abundant when compared to clinical isolates. At minimum twofold increased abundance of phosphoketolase (AFUA_3G00370) and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910)64 was observed. Among the decreased in abundance proteins were hydrolase Exg17 (AFUA_6G14490)65 and 1,3-glucan modifying enzyme Sun1 (AFUA_7G05450)66.Blachowicz et al. Page 6 Fungal Genet Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 18. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript4. DISCUSSION The proteome of A. fumigatus has been studied under various conditions, including short-67, and long-term hypoxia68, following exposure to antifungal agents like amphotericin B69, and voriconazole70, and during different developmental stages58. However, in this report we present unique proteome differences observed in the two ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates. To date, there is no report which elucidates the molecular response of filamentous fungi to the distinct environment of the ISS, despite previous reports of their presence on board of the ISS22 and Mir27,71. In-depth understanding of alterations triggered in the proteome of omnipresent A. fumigatus remains imperative for astronauts health, as it is an opportunistic pathogen that affects individuals with impaired immune system functions41. Both ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains displayed higher abundance of several proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthesis. Trypacidin is a potent mycotoxin produced by A. fumigatus conidia. It has been shown to have cytotoxic activity against A549 alveolar lung cells suggesting its importance during the infection76. Further, it has been reported that A. fumigatus conidia with disrupted production of trypacidin exhibit higher susceptibility to macrophage clearance49. Increased abundance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of trypacidin in both ISSisolated strains may be possible cause of the reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates45. Moreover, emodin and questin, precursors of trypacidin, are pigmented anthraquinones that have been reported to have a protective effect against UV in other organisms ( Xanthoria elegans and Cetraria islandica ) that produce these types of compounds50,77. It is therefore reasonable to assume that up-regulation of trypacidin production may be another adaptation to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, however this hypothesis has to be validated by further experiments. Further, the level of Asp-HS, which is a known toxin produced by A. fumigatus54,78 was highly increased in both ISS-isolates. While several studies have reported its hemolytic79 and cytotoxic80,81 activities in the past, a recent report showed lack of attenuated virulence when Asp-HS gene was deleted82. This discrepancy may be strain specific as the studies used different A. fumigatus strains to carry out the experiments or related to experimental models used in both studies, as at times results observed for in vitro analyses do not correlated with the outcomes observed in in vivo studies. The exact role of Asp-HS in the pathogenicity remains to be determined during future studies. Nonetheless, increased abundance of Asp-HS observed in both ISS-isolated strains appears to be a part of the A. fumigatus adaptation response to the unique ISS environment. One of the increased in abundance proteins in ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains was Arp1, which is one of the six enzymes involved in the DHN-melanin production5153. Arp1 disruption resulted in production of reddish pink conidia with induced C3 binding that led to phagocytosis and killing of conidial spores during infection51,52. Increased abundance of Arp1 protein may, therefore, be another cause of the previously reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model45. Additionally, higher AlbA abundance, involved in DHN-melanin production72, was observed in JSC-093350089 A. niger isolated from Blachowicz et al. Page 7 Fungal Genet Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 18. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe ISS73. Seemingly, both ISS-isolated species, A. fumigatus and A. niger , responded with increased melanin production to enhanced irradiation on board of the ISS. This observation is in agreement with previous reports of increased melanin production in fungi isolated from high-radiation environments such as the Chernobyl Power Plant accident sites or Evolution Canyon74,75. However, because none of the other enzymes involved in the melanin biosynthesis showed increased abundance when compared to both clinical isolates simultaneously, further assessment of melanin production is necessary to definitively conclude its increased production under ISS conditions. Proteome analysis of both ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains revealed altered levels of proteins involved in oxidative stress response. ArtA, a regulatory protein, was reported to be increased in abundance in response to incubation with H 2O2, suggesting its importance in overcoming oxidative stress62. Pst2, which is also present in Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , was shown to be induced in response to oxidative stress83,84. Additionally, Pst2 was reported to be a post-translational modification target protein that is ubiquitinated under peroxide stress conditions in C. albicans85. Interestingly, such post- translational modifications play a role in several cellular processes in eukaryotes, including cell growth regulation and environmental adaptation, suggesting their importance in gaining survival advantage86. These data are in agreement with previous reports of induced oxidative stress response in humans, mice and yeast while in space8791. Overall, increased abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response was also observed in Acinetobacter sp. Ver3 when exposed to UV irradiation92 and JSC-093350089 A. niger73. Although increased abundance of several oxidative stress-correlated proteins was observed in this study, it was previously reported that ISS-isolated strains were more resistant than Af293 to H 2O2 exposure, but less resistant than CEA10, suggesting no adaptation45. Among the more abundant proteins in both ISS-isolated strains several were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540) is one of the three key enzymes involved in glyoxylate cycle63, which has been shown to be crucial for fungal growth on C 2 compounds and fatty acids as a sole carbon source93. In our earlier study it was documented that these two ISS-isolated strains significantly outgrew both clinical isolates45. Further, more abundant PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), a pyruvate decarboxylase, has been shown to be involved in ethanol fermentation60. These data therefore suggest possible adaptation of A. fumigatus to low-nutrient environment of the ISS20,22, which is in agreement with changes observed in proteome of A. fumigatus during starvation94. Similarly, up-regulation of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in ISS- isolated JSC-093350089 A. niger73. This study presents comparative proteomic analysis of two ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 when compared to clinically established isolates Af293 and CEA10. Such comparison has enabled the identification of possible adaptation responses to the unique microgravity environment of the ISS, which includes increased abundance of stress response related proteins, and modulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. To our knowledge this is the first report that focused on studying the proteomic changes in filamentous fungus isolated from on board of the ISS.
