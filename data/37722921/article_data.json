Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti-sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.\nMETHODS: Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100\u00a0nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500\u00a0\u03bcM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP-tagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 post-adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA-mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the life-course.\nRESULTS: We found 100\u00a0nM and 1\u00a0\u03bcM ZA increased lifespan (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and healthspan [954\u00a0\u00b1\u00a053 (100\u00a0nM) and 963\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) vs. 834\u00a0\u00b1\u00a059% (untreated) population activity AUC, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05]. 10\u00a0\u03bcM ZA shortened lifespan (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) but not healthspan (758.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037 vs. 834\u00a0\u00b1\u00a059, P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), whereas 100 and 500\u00a0\u03bcM ZA were larval lethal. ZA (1\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on days 4 and 6 post-adulthood (83 and 71% well-organized myofibres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and increased well-networked mitochondria at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Genes required for ZA-mediated healthspan extension included fdps-1/FDPS-1 (278\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 vs. 894\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017% population activity AUC in knockdown\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), daf-16/FOXO (680\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016 vs. 894\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and agxt-2/BAIBA (531\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023 vs. 552\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08%, P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).

Physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modi able lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia.5However, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub-optimal,6and certain older indi- viduals can be unable (i.e., through injury andor access to ex-ercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. Indeed, 50 70 of those aged 75 years are physi- cally inactive, 7meaning complementary pharmaceutical ther- apies are relevant to a signi cant portion of the ageing pop- ulation. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display var-iable therapeutic ef cacy and associate with harmful side-effect pro les that render them inappropriate for long-term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variableefcacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease 8 but is a potent immunosuppressant9unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identi cation efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically ap- proved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery. Bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of en- dogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, includingmuscle. 10Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophos- phate, bisphosphonates inhibit calci cation and lower hy- droxyapatite degradation,11while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions.12 Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked: Effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle-bone communication is essential to muscle and bonehealth, 13with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together.14Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate (the most popular rst-line bisphosphonates) for between 6 months and 3 years display signi cant in- creases in muscle strength15and total muscle mass.16Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid(ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia, 17Duchenne muscular dystrophy18and denervation-induced muscle atrophy.19Ret- rospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA for 3 years also exhibit signi cant increases in total lean mus- cle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreatedcontrols.20In the ageing context, ZA-treated fruit ies displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscularageing. 21However, the direct anti-sarcopenic ef cacy of ZA has not been established. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age-related deterioration of multiple tissues, including muscle.22 C. elegans muscle is also highly morphologically and metabol- ically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology (60 85) of sub-muscular systems with people.23As with fruit ies,C. elegans are invertebrates that do not possess clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors (osteokines ).24C. elegans are, therefore, an excellent system for understanding muscle-speci c mechanisms of bisphosphonates, independently of bone-derived con- founders. We thus employed C. elegans as a genomic model of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone-independenteffects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline with realistic, near-term applicability in the clinic. Methods Assessing zoledronic acid effects on Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and healthspan Wild-type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by grav- ityotation and 80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar 50 mM NaCl, 0.25 (wv) bacteriological peptone, 1.7 (wv) agar, 1 mM CaCl 2, 1 mM MgSO 4,2 5m MK H 2PO4 (pH 6), 12.9 M cholesterol and seeded with 200 Lo f OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria. For ZA treatments, 100 Lo f dilute compound (i.e. 100L of 2.3 M, 23 M, 230 M, 2.3 mM and 11.5 M intermediate dilutions in ddH 2O for 100 nM, 1 M, 10 M, 100 M and 500 M concentrations, respectively) were diluted into a 2.3 mL plate volume toachieve the desired nal concentration. Control animals were grown on plates seeded with 100 L of ddH 2O to account for any diluting of bacterial lawns. Animals were grown on petridishes for 48 h at 20C to reach young adulthood, then washed off using 3 mL M9 buffer (3 g KH 2PO4,6g Na2HPO 4, 5 g NaCl, 1 mL 1 M MgSO 4per litre) and pooled into 60 cm petri dishes. From these pooled samples, 70 young adults were collected and loaded into micro uidic chips (In nity chips; Nemalife Inc., TX) using a 2.5 mL syringe, where the animals remained throughout the rest of the life course. Using the In nity screening system (Nemalife Inc., TX), on every day of the life course, chips were washed for90 s with liquid NGM to remove progeny followed by a fur- ther 90 s recording for subsequent computational analysis2614 L. Slade et al . Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2023; 14: 2613 2622 DOI: 10.1002jcsm.13335of animal survival and locomotion. Chips were then injected with 200 L of 20 mgmL OP50 supplemented with ZA or ddH 2O. Speci cally, 980 L of 20 mgmL OP50 was supple- mented with 20 L of the required ZA intermediate dilution (i.e., 5 M, 50 M and 500 M intermediates for 100 nM, 1M and 10 M of ZA, respectively) or 20 L of ddH 2Of o r controls. Chips were then stored in petri dishes at 20C for the next 24 h with a damp, sterile tissue and para lmed to avoid the micro uidic arena drying out. Lifespan was performed using the In nity system screening platform (Nemalife Inc., TX). Speci cally, 90 s videos were split into three still image frames (frames 1, 300 and 900),and the In nity screening system automates a bounding box around every (70 80) whole animal in the micro uidic chip. Using the In nity system software (Nemalife Inc., TX), compu- tational coef cients determine animal displacements from outside this bounding box and were used for both lifespan and healthspan analysis. Animals were deemed dead if coef-cients were 0.01 (no movement) and alive if values were 0.01. For healthspan analysis, movement rate was em- ployed as one of the most robust measures of animalhealthspan. 25For quanti cation, animals that obtained coef- cients of 0.01 0.40 (i.e., unable to move more than half its body length between subsequent frames) were deemed inac-tive. Animals with scores of 0.41 1 were classed as active  animals (i.e., moving half of, or more than its full body-length in displacement between subsequent frames). Both lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of micro uidic-housed populations. Average values were taken from movement scores between all threeframes. In addition to software automation, each video was manually corrected for any false positivesbox deformations that could skew movement scores. Daily mean movementvalues were converted to area under the curve to denote to- tal population movement scores across the entire life course. Zoledronic acid effects on sarcopenia dystrophic progression with age The anti-sarcopenic effects of ZA (1 M) was visualized and quanti ed using transgenic strains expressing green uores- cent protein (GFP)-tagged sarcomeres (PJ727 strain: jls01 (myo-3:: GFP, rol-6(su1006 ));unc-54::lacZ V) or GFP-tagged mitochondria (CB5600 strain: ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3:: Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3:: Mtgfp) I; him- 8(e1489) IV). Strains were grown on 33 mm plates containing 2 mL NGM agar seeded with 200L of OP50  ZA, as detailed above. Animals were trans- ferred onto fresh plates every 2 days after young adult stageto remove progeny and prevent population starvation. To im- age sarcomere and mitochondrial structure, 30 animals per conditiontime point were picked into 20 L of M9 buffer on a microscope slide (VWR Superfrost, UK) with a cover slip placed on top and imaged immediately using an uprightepiourescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). Images of the body wall muscles were captured from the head and tail region of each animal (avoiding themid-animalvulva region that exhibits frequent egg-laying induced tissue disruption) using an Orca-spark camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) set to 50 ms exposure rate and a gain of3.4 dB for all acquired images. Approximately 10 individual mus- cle cells were scored per animal equating to 300 muscle cells per conditionreplicate and scored as either well networked,moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscle sarco- mere or mitochondria structures as previously described 26 (see Figure S1 for representative images of each class of structural defect). Analysis was carried out in ImageJ, and the number of well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscles were expressed as a percentage of totalmuscle cells visible and analysed within each animal. RNA interference and combined zoledronic acid treatments for lifespan and healthspan analysis The effects of RNAi treatments on animal lifespanhealthspan were determined using bacterial feeding vectors and per- formed in the In nity screening system, as described above. All bacterial lawns expressing double-stranded RNA were grown from the MRC Ahringer Library of bacterial clones to target ( fdps- 1:R06C1.2; daf- 16:R13H8.1; agxt- 2:T09B4.8; igdb- 1:T04A11.3; let- 756:C05D11.4; sir- 2.2:F46G10.7: sir- 2.3:F46G10.3). Each clone was streaked onto LB plates sup- plemented with 50 gmL ampicillin and 25 gmL carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37C. Single colonies were then picked into sterile LB broth supplemented with 50gmL ampicillin and grown for 16 h with shaking at 180 rpm at 37C. After 16 h incubation, 0.4 mM isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added for RNAi induction, with further shaking at 180 rpm for 2 h at 37C as describedpreviously. 27After 18 h incubation, tubes were spun at 3000 gfor 10 min to obtain bacterial pellets. Liquid NGM was added to each bacterial pellet to reach a nal bacteria concentration of 20 mgmL, adding isopropyl -D-1-thio- galactopyranoside to a nal 1 mM concentration before use. For combined ZA treatments, the same bacterial prepa-ration was performed, but with 20 L of dilute ZA supple- mented to 1 mL of 20 mgmL OP50 in NGM for a nal con- centration of 1 M. On every day of the life course, after washingrecording using the In nity system as detailed above, 200 L of RNAi bacteria  ZA (1 M) was injected into the micro uidic chips before storing in petri dishes at 20C for 24 h until washingrefeeding the next day (with drug dilutioncontrol). All bacteria and drug solutions were prepared fresh daily until cessation of life. RNAi experimentswere always conducted alongside empty vector controls (PL4440).Bisphosphonates in sarcopenia 2615 Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2023; 14: 2613 2622 DOI: 10.1002jcsm.13335Statistics Lifespan analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier curves assessed by the log-rank (Mantell Cox) test. Multiple comparisons of survival curves were performed manuallyusing the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. For movement rate, area under the curve (AUC) was performed on mean movement values across each day of adulthood (averagestaken from across all three frames). AUC values and standard deviations obtained from replicate screens were then assessed by one-way ANOVA in GraphPad, Prism. Both mito-chondrial and sarcomere quanti cation were analysed by two-way ANOVA using the percentage classi cation scorefrom individual animals across biological repeats. All statistics were performed in GraphPad, Prism (San Diego, California USA). Results Zoledronic acid extends Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and healthspan Higher ZA concentrations (500 and 100 M) were larval le- thal, and 10 M ZA shortened lifespan (median survival  11 vs. 14 days for controls, P0.0001; Figure 1A) without sig- Figure 1 Zoledronic acid acts dose-dependently to improve C. elegans survival and movement capacity. (A) Animals exposed to 10 M zoledronic acid (ZA) exhibit signi cant declines in survivability (top) to untreated controls (median survival: 10 vs. 14 days, respectively, P0.0001), however, show no signicant impairment in movement capacity (bottom) across whole life ( P 0.208). Conversely, both 1 M (B) and 100 nM (C) were bene cial to an- imal survival (1 M median survival: 16 days, P0.001; 100 nM: 16 days, P0.0001), with paralleled improvements in movement capacity through- out the life course.

Conversely, lifespan extension was ob- served with lower ZA doses of 1 M (median survival  16 days, P0.001; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (me- dian survival  16 days, P0.0001; Figure 1C). These lifespan-promoting ZA doses also associated with healthspan extension at 1 M (AUC  963.1  48.74, P0.05; Figure 1B) and 100 nM (AUC  953.8  53.77, P0.05; Figure 1C) treatments. Additionally, signi cant movement decline onset became apparent in day 9 control animals ( P0.01 vs. day 1 adults), which was upheld across all ZA treatment doses at this single time point (22.2, 31.8 and 17.6 population activity on day 9 vs. untreated controls in 10 M, 1 M and 100 nM, respec- tively). ZA thus acts dose-dependently to augment animal longevity and health across the life course.Zoledronic acid delays age-related declines in muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial integrity To understand the effects of ZA on progressive sarcomere dystrophy across age, transgenic C. elegans expressing GFP-tagged myosin were treated with 1 M ZA. Corroborat- ing previous reports on the temporal age-related loss of sub-cellular muscle structures,22untreated wild-type animals displayed a signi cantC035.6 decline in organized myo bril- lar structure by day 4 post-adulthood ( P0.0001; Figure 2A, B), which worsened to C058.0 by day 6 post-adulthood (P0.0001). ZA delayed loss of organized sarcomeres until day 6 post-adulthood ( C015.6, P0.01), and signi cantly in- creased the number of muscle cells displaying organized sar- comeres versus untreated controls at days 4 (83.9 vs.54.4) and 6 (71.1 vs. 31.4) post-adulthood (both P0.0001, Figure 2A,B ). ZA also decreased muscle cells cat- Figure 2 Zoledronic acid attenuates age-related loss of sarcomere integrity.

We next examined the effects of ZA on mitochondrial in- tegrity, given the strong associations of mitochondrial struc- ture and function with ageing animal health. In line with pre- vious wild-type ageing studies,22loss of networked mitochondria occurred by day 2 post-adulthood ( Figure S2), which progressively worsened at day 4 ( C042.6, P0.0001) and day 6 post-adulthood ( C067.0, P0.0001; Figure 3A,B ). ZA treatment did not delay the on- set of well-networked mitochondria loss at day 2 ( Figure S2) or day 4 post-adulthood (51.8, P0.0001). However, ZA prevented progressive mitochondrial fragmentation at day 6 post-adulthood (46.7, P0.05 vs. day 4), which was also signicantly higher than in untreated animals (46.7 vs. 16.1, P0.01).Zoledronic acid-mediated healthspan extension acts through multiple mechanisms The lifespan extending effects of ZA have previously been at- tributed to the mevalonate cholesterolisoprenoid lipid bio- synthesis pathway and the FOXO family of transcriptionfactors, 21but their role in ZA-induced healthspan extension is unknown. RNAi knockdown (KD) of fdps- 1, an orthologue of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase involved in the biosynthe-sis of farnesyl diphosphate intermediates from mevalonate, impaired survival (median survival  6 vs. 14 days for controls, P0.0001) and healthspan (AUC  287  9 vs. 894  17 pop- ulation activity for controls, P0.0001), which was not im- proved by co-treatment with 1 MZ A( Figure 4A). Similarly, RNAi KD of the daf- 16FOXO stress response pathway im- paired survivability (median survival  12 vs. 14 days for con- trols, P0.0001) and healthspan (AUC  680.5  23.6 vs. 894.2  17.4 for empty vector, P0.01) and prevented the bene cial effects of ZA treatment ( Figure 4B). Figure 3 Zoledronic acid attenuates age-related loss of muscle mitochondrial structure. (A) Untreated animals displayed progressive declines in well-networked mitochondria across days 0, 4 and 6 post-adulthood (for each time point, P0.0001). Zoledronic acid treatment (1 M) animals saw a similar decline by day 4; however, no further decline was evident by day 6 post-adulthood, showing signi cant improvement when compared to untreated animals at this time point ( P0.01).

Slade et al . Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2023; 14: 2613 2622 DOI: 10.1002jcsm.13335The FOXO pathway is a global stress response system, in- ducible by a wide array of stimuli and a generic transcription factor regulating cellular responses across multiple drug families28that integrates multiple upstream signals to in u- ence worm ageing.29Alternative, muscle-centric mechanisms thus also likely contribute to the healthspan bene ts of ZA. To probe potential muscle-derived mechanisms ofZA-induced healthspan extension, we examined the role of three putative myokines that exhibit altered expression across age and implicated in muscle-bone crosstalk: agxt- 2 BAIBA, igdb- 1FNDC5 and let-756FGF21.24Lifespan and healthspan were unaffected by KD of agxt- 2BAIBA (-aminoisobutyric acid), a muscle-borne bone protective factor30; however, combined agxt- 2KD with ZA treatment was unable to confer lifehealthspan extension ( Figure 4C). Conversely, the inhibition of igdb- 1extended lifespan (me- dian survival  11 vs. 7 days for controls, P0.05) and im- proved healthspan (AUC  634.5  10.5 vs. 523  10.0 for con- trols, P0.01), with similar lifehealthspan extension observed upon co-treatment with ZA ( Figure 5A). Addition- ally, let-756 appears dispensable for ZA-induced healthspan effects: KD alone caused no signi cant alterations in survival or movement, whereas increased lifespan and healthspan was retained with combined let-756 KD and ZA treatment (Figure 5B). Recent rodent work shows bisphosphonates attenuate denervation-induced muscle atrophy via downregulation of sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), one of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase family members.19Be- cause SIRT3 is primarily mitochondrially localized,31we exam- ined the role of two C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuins, sir-2.2 and sir-2.3,32for their role in ZA-mediated lifespan and healthspan extension. Reinforcing a mitochondrial role of sir-2.2andsir-2.3, RNAi KD of each gene caused increased mi- tochondrial fragmentation at day 0 post-adulthood ( Figure S3). While sir-2.2KD did not alter animal survival or healthspan, loss of sir-2.2blocked ZA s life extending proper- ties but ZA-induced healthspan extension remained ( Figure 5C). Additionally, and in line with previous reports in C. elegans ,33wend that knockdown of sir-2.3extends lifespan ( Figure 5D) and healthspan ( Figure 5H), which re- mains with combined ZA treatment but is not synergistically bene cial. Discussion Despite the socio-economic implications, treatment options for sarcopenia remain mostly limited to modi able lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, which are incompletelyeffective. 34Complementary drug interventions would, there- fore, bene t a signi cant portion of the ageing population, yet effectual compounds that are safe for long-termuse remain elusive. Identifying drugs in clinical use and repurposing for sarcopenia indications could provide immedi- Figure 4 FDPS, FOXO and BAIBA orthologues are required for the healthspan effects of zoledronic acid. Knockdown of FDPS- 1(FDPS) with ZA co-treatment (1 M) prevents ZA mediated lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) extension (A). Similarly, knockdown of daf-16(FOXO) decreases survival and movement, with no improvement with ZA co-treatment (B).

Bisphosphonates have been used to safely treat osteoporosis for decades.35Here, we report that bisphosphonates (ZA) ex- tend C. elegans lifespan and healthspan, which associates with delayed onset of muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial de- cline. While general stress response pathways, such as FOXO, regulate these positive healthspan responses to ZA, we estab-lish muscle-centric myokines ( agxt- 2and igdb- 1) and mito- chondrial sirtuin ( sir-2.3) as previously unknown regulators of bisphosphonate effects on ageing muscle health. Growing pre-clinical1719and human20evidence suggest that bisphosphonates not only preserve bone integrity but also exert muscle promoting effects across a variety of condi-tions. A recent study in fruit ies suggest similar effects might extend to the ageing process, where bisphosphonate treat- ment prolonged lifespan and animal healthspan. 21We pro- vide the rstin vivo evidence for a direct role of chronic bis- phosphonate administration in delaying age-related muscle structural decline. Because ageing muscle architectural alter-ations are a hallmark of human sarcopenia that relate to lowered motility in animals, 22bisphosphonate-mediated sar- comere preservation could translate to reduced sarcopenia inhigher animals and people. ZA also attenuated ageing muscle mitochondrial decline. Mitochondrial health is strongly linked with sarcopenic progression across species and mitochondrialstructure corresponds with oxidative function 23; therefore, bisphosphonates might hold dual, and possibly interrelated, efcacy for maintaining muscle metabolic health and sarco- meric integrity. While we assessed animals at, and beyond,the point of onset of age-related sub-muscular decline, the anti-sarcopenic ef cacy of bisphosphonates into very old age remains to be determined. Nonetheless, using our micro- uidic healthspan device27and animal movement rate as a robust index of health,25we demonstrate that early- to mid-life muscle preservation translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. Bisphosphonates thusrepresent a promising strategy for maintaining muscle, and whole animal health into older age. In fruit ies, bisphosphonates increase lifespan through inhibition of the mevalonate metabolic pathway and downstream FOXO activation. 21We extend this by implicating the mevalonate-FOXO system as necessary forbisphosphonate-mediated health improvements across the life course. The sterol and non-sterol isoprenoids synthesized via mevalonate localize to plasma membranes and in uence several vital cellular processes, the dysfunction of which asso- ciate with wide ranging pathologies including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, cancer and Alzheimer s disease. 36Our data suggest that sarcopenia can be added to this list, whereby knockdown of a key enzyme in mevalonate metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase ( fdps- 1), allows normal larval development to adulthood and young adult (day 1) movement rates, corroborating earlier reports of nor- mal L4 larvae muscle architecture upon fdps- 1RNAi.37There- after, downregulation of fdps- 1causes rapid neuromuscular functional decline (i.e., animal motility), likely indicative of accelerated sarcopenia. Because zoledronic acid is unable to improve lifespan and healthspan in fdps- 1ordaf-16 Figure 5 Genes either dispensable, or that associate with ZA s healthspan effects. Knockdown of igdb- 1(FNDC5) signi cantly increased survival and healthspan, where ZA co-treatment (1 M) was not synergistic, but displayed similar improvements in lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) suggest- ingigdb- 1might exhibit ZA-induced downregulation (A), or act independently to increase healthspan. Conversely, let-756(FGF21, B) is dispensable for both lifespan and healthspan extension with ZA. The mitochondrial sirtuins displayed opposing effects; sir-2.2(SIRT-4, C) is dispensable for ZA s healthspan effects, whereas sir-2.3(SIRT-4) knockdown increased survival and movement (D), as did ZA co-treatment, suggesting sir-2.3downregula- tion might mediate ZA s healthspan effects.

Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle 2023; 14: 2613 2622 DOI: 10.1002jcsm.13335knockdown animals, the mevalonate-FOXO pathway is strongly implicated in the ageing neuromuscular health bene- ts of bisphosphonates. Bi-directional communication between muscle and bone has long been established, including mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle-bone signalling.13,24We, therefore, ex- amined the mechanistic role of three putative muscle-derived signalling factors ( myokines ) involved in muscle-bone crosstalk that exhibit altered age-related function.24Of these, agxt- 2BAIBA was necessary for the positive healthspan ef- fects of ZA, while agxt- 2KD alone was not harmful to animal longevity or health. BAIBA promotes insulin sensitivity, anti-inammation 38and osteocyte survival in mice,39and its ex- pression does not decline with age39; thus, BAIBA-mediated musclehealth bene ts of bisphosphonates would be antici- pated to remain in older age. Knockdown of igdb- 1FNDC5 extended worm lifespan and healthspan, countering human studies implicating low circulating FNDC5 as a sarcopeniabiomarker. 40The healthspan effects of igdb- 1KD were also comparable with ZA co-treatment. This inability of idgb- 1 KD to neither ablate nor synergistically augment the positive effects of ZA could be interpreted as ZA exerting healthspan-promoting inhibitory effects on igdb- 1or, alterna- tively, acting through igdb- 1independent pathways. Con- versely, let-756FGF21 appears dispensable for ZA-induced lifespan and healthspan extension. Because C. elegans lack an endoskeleton, these ndings espouse agxt- 2BAIBA and igdb- 1FNDC5 as muscle-intrinsic, bone-independent mecha- nisms of bisphosphonate action on improving sarcopenia. Recent rodent work showed that bisphosphonates attenu- ate denervation atrophy by down-regulating sirtuin-3 (SIRT3),19a mitochondrially localized NAD-dependent de- acetylase with important roles in regulating skeletalmuscle metabolism. We observed that knocking-down a C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuin, sir- 2.3, improved life- and healthspan, whereas mitochondrial sir-2.2KD had no effect, as reported by others.33Because sir-2.3KD with combined ZA was neither inhibitory nor synergistically bene cial to lifespan or healthspan, this supports the model ofbisphosphonate-mediated mitochondrial sirtuin inhibition as a regulator of mammalian muscle health 19and now sarcope- nia. Loss of sir-2.2was, however, dispensable for the positive effects of ZA. Along with improved mitochondrial structure observed herein, growing evidence thus suggests that bisphosphonates act at least partially through mitochondrialmechanisms to lessen the effects of sarcopenia.In conclusion, chronic bisphosphonate administration delays the onset of muscle structural and mitochondrial decline in a C. elegans model of sarcopenia, and this translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. The mechanisms regulating the positive ageingmuscle effects of bisphosphonates appear to be conserved acrossspecies and include the mevalonate-FOXO metabolic axis, mitochondrial sirtuins and muscle-derived cytokines. Because worms lack an endoskeleton, these mechanisms ofbisphosphonates can also be muscle-intrinsic. By directly im- plicating bisphosphonates in attenuating the consequences of sarcopenia, this study adds to a growing body of evidencethat bisphosphonates are a clinically safe, immediately exploit- able anti-sarcopenia therapeutic.

        "introduction": "Age-related muscle decline, termed sarcopenia , is classi ed as a speci c disease associated with numerous health risk fac- tors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10 of older populations1and up to 31 as a co-morbidity.2Despite asso- ciated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions3and signicant impacts on individual quality of life and all-cause mortality,4efcacious treatment strategies against sarcope- nia remain limited. Physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modi able lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia.5However, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub-optimal,6and certain older indi- viduals can be unable (i.e., through injury andor access to ex-ercise facilities) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. Indeed, 50 70 of those aged 75 years are physi- cally inactive, 7meaning complementary pharmaceutical ther- apies are relevant to a signi cant portion of the ageing pop- ulation. Established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display var-iable therapeutic ef cacy and associate with harmful side-effect pro les that render them inappropriate for long-term clinical use. For example, rapamycin holds variableefcacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease 8 but is a potent immunosuppressant9unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. Drug identi cation efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically ap- proved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery. Bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of en- dogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, includingmuscle. 10Recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophos- phate, bisphosphonates inhibit calci cation and lower hy- droxyapatite degradation,11while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. As such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions.12 Yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked: Effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle-bone communication is essential to muscle and bonehealth, 13with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together.14Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate (the most popular rst-line bisphosphonates) for between 6 months and 3 years display signi cant in- creases in muscle strength15and total muscle mass.16Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid(ZA), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia, 17Duchenne muscular dystrophy18and denervation-induced muscle atrophy.19Ret- rospective analysis of osteoporosis patients prescribed ZA for 3 years also exhibit signi cant increases in total lean mus- cle mass, compared with a loss of muscle mass in untreatedcontrols.20In the ageing context, ZA-treated fruit ies displayed increased survival and improved climbing ability across the life course, suggesting improved neuromuscularageing. 21However, the direct anti-sarcopenic ef cacy of ZA has not been established. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model of ageing, displaying ordered, progressive age-related deterioration of multiple tissues, including muscle.22 C. elegans muscle is also highly morphologically and metabol- ically similar to human muscle and has high genetic orthology (60 85) of sub-muscular systems with people.23As with fruit ies,C. elegans are invertebrates that do not possess clear orthologues of mammalian bone secretory factors (osteokines ).24C. elegans are, therefore, an excellent system for understanding muscle-speci c mechanisms of bisphosphonates, independently of bone-derived con- founders. We thus employed C. elegans as a genomic model of ageing muscle decline to establish the bone-independenteffects, and mechanisms of, bisphosphonates on sarcopenia progression as part of an ageing drug translational pipeline with realistic, near-term applicability in the clinic.",
        "conclusion": "s Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to im- proved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable anti-sarcopenia therapy.
