Keywords YeastMicrogravity Reactive oxygen species Spaceflight Shear stress Random positioning machine  Apoptosis Introduction The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understandmechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and a g i n g( C a pe ta l .2009a ;A y e re ta l . 2014;H e r k e re ta l . 2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based envelopebackTimothy G. Hammond hammondoutofofficeyahoo.com Extended author information available on the last page of the article.colonies (Cap et al. 2009a ). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colonyis dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification ofthe population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling(Cap et al. 2009a ). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays usinga deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al. 2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colonyon solid agar models many of the changes seen within solidtumors (Cap et al. 2009a ,2010, 2012a ,d). Yeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations.Received:10July2017Accepted:19December2017Publishedonline:29December2017 TheAuthor(s)2017.Thisarticleisanopenaccesspublication196 MicrogravitySci.Technol.(2018)30:195208 Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism e.g. increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and V olz 1979) and phenotype e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al. 1996). Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responsesof liquid culture yeast to real (e.g. spaceflight) microgravityand simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a ,b; Hammond et al.1999; Johanson et al. 2002; Nislow et al. 2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role inthe responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al.2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al. 2008a ). Little is known about the effects of spaceflight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al. 2009b, 2012b, c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony, begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly,thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity drivenconvection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeastcolony differentiation (Cap et al. 2009a ; Palkova et al. 1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seenin microgravity might affect this process. To answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (e.g. spaceflight) and in twoground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation andrandom positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during spaceflight (Hammond andHammond 2001; Lee et al. 2014;B i r d s a l le ta l . 2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cellsand gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al. 2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of gravity- vector-averaging, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al. 2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and truemicrogravity (Grimm et al. 2014), and controversy as towhether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al.2004; Murdoch et al. 2013; Wuest et al. 2017). Metabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance thisprocess colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar(Cap et al. 2009a ; Palkova et al. 1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays,tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients,we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media. Three major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table 1lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated indifferent strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies inground studies (Cap et al. 2012a ,d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered inliquid cultures of yeast in spaceflight (Walther et al. 1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation onthe ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al. 2016; Cap et al. 2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant 2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker 2004). Second, we evaluated the dependence of two stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, on the stress promoters,Msn4 and Sfp1 (Johanson et al. 2002). We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during spaceflight that differs from ground-based controls(Coleman et al. 2008a ). Third, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence ofthese outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al.2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process arenot known. We have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giantyeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al. 2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of spaceflightas well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning.

This study is a systematic examination of the effects of true microgravity versus common microgravity simulations, and nutrient rich media versus nutrient poormedia, on major mechanistic mediators including shearstress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. This lays the ground work for future yeast experiments to study cell-to-cell interactions, cell signaling,cell survival, colony differentiation and aging, mechanisms of drug action, and characteristics of tumor generation. MethodsandMaterials ChemicalsandReagents Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4743 (i.e., wild type (WT)), was used to match our earlier studies (Hammond et al. 2015). This parental strain, as well as Msn4 deletion, Sfp1 deletion, BEM1-eGFP and TRR1-eGFP yeast clones were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). FITC-V AD-fmk was purchased from Promega Corporation(Madison, WI). FITC Annexin V was purchased fromClontech Laboratories Inc. (Mountain View, CA). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Media consisted of rich YPD (1 yeastextract, 2 peptone, 2 dextrose (D-glucose)) or poor YE (1 yeast extract, 3 glycerol, 1 ethanol, and 10 mMCaCl 2)( B i r d s a l le ta l .2016). 2 agar was added to YPD or YE for solid phase cultures. ConstructionofYeastGreenFluorescentProtein(eGFP) ExpressionClones Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to direct integrate genomic of DNA coding for and in-frame GFP epitope tagat the C-terminus of selected open reading frames (ORFs) in the yeast genome as described previously (Howson et al. 2005)a n d https:yeastgfp.yeastgenome.org . GiantYeastColonyCultures:Static,RotatingRandom PositioningMachineandSpaceight 100l of stationary culture inocula of each yeast strain were placed in 5 ml of fresh YPD or YE media and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30 C. Omniwell plates prefilled with 40ml of YE or YPD agar were spotted with 60 l of the overnight liquid culture with forty-eight spots perplate. To minimize dehydration after drying the Omniwell lids were sealed to the base with Durapore tape and the plates were placed in plastic Ziploc bags. The plates werecooled to 4 C and were divided into five sets of four plates - one set for each of the five growth conditions. Each setcontained a full series on YPD agar and a full series on YEagar.198 MicrogravitySci.Technol.(2018)30:195208 Figure 1summarizes the matrix of experiments per- formed. Flight and static ground control plates were sent to Kennedy Space Center in chilled shipping containers. Just prior to flight, working in a cold room, the plates were transferred to barcoded Ziploc bag and stacks of eightwere placed in Lexan bags and then into plate habitats (PHABs; http:www-bioserve.colorado.edutech Sheets pdfsSelectBioServeHardware.pdf ; BioServe Space Tech- nologies, CO). The PHAB is a sealed container that allowsfor gas exchange but meets NASA safety requirements for levels of containment. ( https:www.nasa.govcenters johnsonengineeringlife support systemscrew payloadindex. html ). PHABs were placed in cold bags at 4C, and remained chilled for five days during handoff to the SpaceX-8 rocket.Flight samples were flown to the International Space Station(ISS). Approximately two days post-launch, the growth of the yeast on ISS was initiated by transferring the PHABs to Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4 (CGBA4)(Hoehn et al. 2004)t h a tw a ss e tt o3 0 C( B i o S e r v e Space Technologies, CO). After 28 days in flight, CGBA4was commanded down to 4 C. The following day the PHABs were moved back to cold bags, and returned toEarth the next day on the Dragon capsule. Plates remained chilled for a total of six days during undocking, return to Earth, salvage, and transport to the lab for flow cytometryanalysis.

Approximately two days post-launch, the plates on the ISS werewarmed to 30 C to initiate yeast growth. After 28 days inflight, the plates were chilled and returned to Earth. Static ground controls wereoriented with the agar surface facing upwards. For rotation studies,plates were securely taped to the front of the rotating wall vesselhead so that the plates were perpendicular to the floor. For randompositioning, plates were secured to the platform of a Desktop Random Positioning MachineThe second set of plates, the static flight controls were loaded into a second set of PHABs at Kennedy Space Center and handled to match the exact timing and temperature profile of the flight samples. Ground controls were conducted with a 24-hour offset relative to the flightsamples and the static controls in PHABs followed the same temperature changes as the flown samples. A third and fourth set of samples were subjected to Wall- Vessel rotation or random positioning (RPM) during growth. The timing of the rotating and RPM cultures matched that of the flight samples with the exception that they were grownat ambient laboratory conditions (25 C) rather than 30 C and they were not placed in PHABs. To control for the difference, an additional set of static ground controls weremaintained in plastic bags at 25 C and also not placed in PHABs. Results from the two set of static controls, PHABs30C versus no-PHAB25C, did not differ (Pear- son correlation 95) so data from the two were pooled in the statistical analyzes. Similarly, we could not detect anydifferences due to plate position of the replication using any of the modalities studied (Pearson correlation 95). Static controls were incubated with the agar facing upwards. For rotation studies, four stacked Omniwell plates in plastic bags were securely taped to the front of the rotator head (Synthecon, Houston TX) oriented with thesurface of the agar perpendicular to the floor (see Fig. 1). Plates were spun at 12 rpm in a direction co-planar with the surface of the agar around an axis of rotationat the center plate. Replicate colonies of each clone were spotted in 4 to 6 sites on the agar and located 10 to 75 mm from the axis of rotation. For random positioning, fourOmniwell plates were taped to the baseplate of a DesktopRandom Positioning Machine (Dutch Space, Leiden, The Netherlands), set to simulated 0 g during 3-D vector- averaging random positioning. The colonies on the agarsurfaces were approximately 70mm, 55 mm, 40 mm, and 25 mm from the rotation axis. The stack was continuously re-positioned with random direction and speed to achieve anet zero gravity vector. Maximum accelerationdeceleration was 161 degreessec 2, maximum input frame speed was 45 degreessec, and positioning speed was 45 degreessec. This data meets the Bonn Criteria (Hammond and Allen 2011). Flight, rotation, and RPM growth conditions had four replicates on the parental strains and six replicates for thedeletion strains. Static cultures had eight replicates for theflight, rotation, and RPM conditions and 12 replicates for the static cultures. Assaysforshearstressgeneexpression,celldeath,gene expression,andreactiveoxygenspecies All assays were performed by flow cytometry. Our probes for viability, GFP expression, and yeast redox levels haveMicrogravitySci.Technol.(2018)30:195208 199 been validated previously (Birdsall et al. 2016). The choice of parameters to assay were based on the importance of the effects of shear stress promoters, reactive oxygen species, and cell death in giant yeast colonies. On the day of each assay, giant yeast colonies were removed from the agarplate with a plastic tissue culture loop, placed in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and suspended by vortex. 50l aliquots of yeast in PBS were placed in 5ml tubes preloaded with 300 l of propidium iodide (PI) at 1 gml solution to measure viability, or 300 l of dihydroethidium (DHE) at 5 gml to measure reactive oxygen. To measure caspase yeast were washed once in PBS, pelleted, incubated for 20 min at 28 C in 200 l of 10 M FITC-V AD-fmk, and then washed once in PBS. To measure annexin, yeast were washed in sorbitolbuffer (1.2M sorbitol, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 35 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8), digested for 30 min at 28 C with 5.5 glusuase and 15 Umml lyticase in sorbitol buffer, and washed twice in kit binding buffer to which 1.2 M sorbitol is added. Yeast were resuspended in 100 l binding buffer with sorbitol and stained with 5 l of annexin and 1 lo f PI at 0.1 mgml in binding buffer with sorbitol for 15 min at room temperature for 15 min. 400 l binding buffer with sorbitol was added and the samples were maintained on iceuntil analyzed Positive controls for the PI, DHE, annexin binding, and caspase assays were generated by heating yeast to 40 Cf o r three minutes and by exposing yeast to 120 mM acetic acidfor five minutes. Negative controls were generated using liquid yeast cultures in log phase growth. Flow cytometry of PI-stained cells revealed three peaks - high uptake, low uptake, and negative uptake. Cell death was identified as high PI uptake (Lin et al. 2008). Cell apoptosis was identified as low uptake of PI and positivestaining with annexin V , and expression of related caspaseswas identified with FITC-V AD-FMK (Qi et al. 2003. CaspACE FITC-V AD-FMK In Situ Marker (PromegaCorporation, Madison WI) is a fluorescent analog of thepan caspase inhibitor Z-V AD-FMK (carbobenzoxy-valyl- alanyl-aspartyl-O-methyl-fluoromethylketone) (Qi et al. 2003). The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) group hasbeen substituted for the carbobenzoxy (Z) N-terminalblocking group to create a fluorescent apoptosis marker. This structure allows delivery of the inhibitor into the cell where it irreversibly binds to activated caspases. Flow cytometry was performed in the Duke Human Vac- cine Institute Research Flow Cytometry Shared ResourceFacility under the direction of Dr. Gregory D. Sempowski(Durham, NC). Flow cytometric studies were carried on a Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA) LSRII cell analyzer flow cytometer using ExcitationEmission of 510580nm,532610nm, and 488530 nm for DHE, PI, and GFPCaspACE FITC-V AD-FMKannexin, respectively. Theinstrument was aligned using fluorescent beads. Yeast cellgating was established using a display of log side scatterfluorescence verses linear forward scatter, using glutaralde- hyde stained pan fluorescent controls for confirmation in fluorescent channels. Unstained yeast samples were used todetermine levels of background fluorescence Measurements were collected on at least 10,000 cells per sample. Statistics Flow cytometry data is presented as geometric mean standard error of the mean of fluorescence in arbitraryunits compared to a negative control with a minimum of six replicates. Geometric means were determined using FlowJo Software (Ashland, OR). Analysis of variance andpost-hoc comparison using Tukeys test was performedusing Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK), using correlation matrix product moment and partial correlations. Flow cytometry data was also analyzed statistically usingKolgomorov-Smirnov summation statistics (Young 1977). Specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for thedata in Figs. 2,3,a n d4 are tabulated in Tables 2,3,a n d 4. Results Expression of the stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, was measured using eGFP fusion protein expression clones. Stress promoter dependence was assessed by comparing theeGFP signal of the parent strains to clones in which theMsn4 or Sfp1 promoter genes had been deleted (Fig. 2and Table 2). In summary, in colonies grown on rich YPD media, SSA4 increased compared to static culture in all culture modalities. The increases in SSA4 expression seen in flight and rotation, but not random positioning, wereSfp1 dependent. RPL34B gene expression did not change during any culture condition on YPD. Flight and rotation had oppositely directed RPL34B gene expression changesdependent on Msn4. Colonies grown on nutrient poor YE media yielded gene expression changes distinct from those seen in nutrientrich YPD media. SSA4 expression increased in flight andwas Sfp1dependent. Ssa4 expression did not change during rotation and decreased during random positioning. In both rotation and random positioning, expression of SSA4 wasdependent on both Msn4 and Sfp1. On YE media, RPL34B increased in flight with Msn4 dependence, but did not change during rotation or random positioning. Expression of ATO3, INO1, TRR1, BEM1 and EDC3 is shown in Fig. 3and Table 3. Expression of SSA4 and RPL34B is shown in Fig. 2, as noted above.

Expression of three genes, INO1, TRR1, andSSA4, changed in flight on both YPD and YE. In flight, expression of RPL34B increased on YE but not YPD, while expression of BEM1 was the reverse, changing in increasingin YPD but not YE. The only other change in INO1 was a decreased expression on YE during rotation. Expression of TRR1 had no other changes. Expression of SSA4 alsodecreased during random positioning on YE, and increased on YPD during rotation and random positioning. Expression of BEM1 did not change on YE, but increased on YPD withflight, rotation and random positioning. ATO3 expression,which did not change in flight, had no changes on YE, but increased on YPD under both rotation and random positioning growth conditions. Cell death by necrosis and apoptosis (as measured by PI and Annexin V staining) was affected by the culturemodalities and manifested diverse stress defense promoterdependence (Fig. 4and Table 4). In summary, in flight cell necrosis had no baseline changes but showed dramaticSfp1 and Msn4 dependence only on YE. Necrosis wasreduced on YE during both rotation and random positioningdependent on both Sfp1 and Msn4. Basal necrosis rateswere decreased and dependence on Sfp1 during rotation,and on Msn4 during both rotation and random positioning. In flight, apoptosis was reduced only on YE, and on YPD basal apoptosis was both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent. Duringrotation basal apoptosis rates were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent only on YE. During random positioning basal apoptosis rates were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent on bothYE and YPD. Changes in Annexin V exposure and caspase activity (indicative of apoptosis) were consistent with the changesin the middle peak of propidium iodide stained cells(e.g. low PI uptake) observed by flow cytometry. The specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for DHE staining are tabulated in Table 4. As controls, assay of fresh wild type cells was no different to unstained cells for annexin binding but showed caspase expression providing a negative control baseline (data not shown). Treatmentwith acetic acid or heat induced both caspase activity and annexin binding providing positive controls (data not shown).

Caspase only changed from static controls during flight on YE, and on YPD onlyduring rotation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, especially superoxide formation, was monitored with DHE. Positivecontrol cells were induced with acetic acid and heat (data not shown). On YE, none of the culture techniques changed DHE signal, but basal levels were Sfp1 and Msn4dependent. The specific fluorescent values and statistical parameters for DHE staining are tabulated in Table 4.O n YPD, DHE signal was increased in flight, independent of the stress defense promoters. Rotation and random positioningdid not change DHE levels, but basal levels were both Sfp1 and Msn4 dependent under these culture conditions. Discussion Systematic studies of the effects of true microgravity and common microgravity simulations on cell physiology has been lacking. Furthermore, how these environments combine with other fundamental variables such as growthmedia to influence the cellular response to stress is an outstanding question. We address both of these by examining cellular changes, including gene expression(reported by shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1),reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. The current studies define a role of ammonia signal- ing and stress pathways using physical methods to disruptammonia convection in giant yeast colonies. Several lines of evidence support increased ammonia signaling during the near total lack of convection during colony culture inmicrogravity. First, of all the models tested, microgravity was the only one to increase both select reactive oxy- gen species and stress defense genes. These genes includeinositol-3-phosphate synthase (INO1), thioredoxin reduc-tase (TRR1), and stress seventy subfamily A (SSA4). These changes were independent of media type. Interestingly, both INO1 and TRR1 are predominantly expressed in the L orlower colony cells when yeast colony stratify into feeder and growing layers in giant colonies (Cap et al. 2009a ; Palkova et al. 1997). This suggests that ammonia signaling is increased when the generated ammonia cannot convectaway from the colonies. Second, the increased expression of the stress defense dependent SSA4 gene is consistentwith lack of oxygen availability and carbon dioxide accu-mulation as these gasses are also affected by the lack of convection. Third, expression of both SSA4 and RPL34B increased more in flight when the classic stress defensepromoter Msn4 was deleted. Shear stress promoters have a complex interplay of effects on the expression of genes they modify (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a ,b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002). Table 5summarizes theeffects of shear press promoters on expression of depen-dent genes during manipulation of physical forces from thisreport as well as previous studies. Even within just these two shear stress response genes (SSA4 and RPL34b), with and without deletion of shear stress promoters (Msn4 andSfp1), there is scant commonality of the gene expression changes or promoter dependence. Interestingly, a similar signaling phenomenon was recently reported for bacteria,where acetate accumulation in the boundary layer affected metabolism, presumably likewise due to lack of convec- tion in microgravity (Zea et al. 2016)a n di n E. coli where nutrient depletion in simulated microgravity induced stressresponse genes (Vukanti and Leff 2012). Cell death by necrosis and apoptosis increased in flight as shown by multiple modalities: uptake of propidiumiodide up, expression of caspase, and binding of annexin V . Induction of apoptosis by simulated microgravity has been seen with other cell types including human lymphocytes(Ward et al. 2006). This increased cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsivepromoters Msn4 or Sfp1. The finding of both necroticand apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activityof both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova 2005) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan 2012). The changes in INO1 and SSA4 genes are significant in both random positioning with gravity vector averagingand rotation techniques but oppositely directed to the space flight changes, underscoring the uniqueness of the effectsof true microgravity. During culture on the ISS, yeastcultures are also exposed to increased radiation (Nislow et al.2015). Our previous studies using yeast deletion series in liquid culture to evaluate the effects of spaceflight revealed two dominant responses: radiationDNA repair and reactive oxygen pathways (Nislow et al. 2015). We conclude that the ISS provides a unique suite of stimuli with distinct set of responses: the question is how to translate these properties to i) further NASAs program objectives, ii) support commercial development, and iii) address unmetclinical needs. We found differences in the responses of yeast in the rotating wall vessel versus random positioning models inboth ammonia-dependent and stress-dependent changes,providing clarity to the controversy as to whether the random positioning device is a form of rotation, or a distinct stimulus (Klaus 2001; Klaus et al. 2004). These differences included gene expression changes mediated by shear stress promoters, redox status, and apoptosis. Hence, we conclude that the forces induced by random positioning and rotationare distinct. Many resources are available for scientistsseeking to study the effects of gravity on biologic systems206 MicrogravitySci.Technol.(2018)30:195208 Table 5 Dependence of SSA4 and RPL34B on Msn4 and Sfp1 under different conditions Condition Msn4 dependence Sfp1 dependence Study SSA4 RPL34B SSA4 RPL34B 1g Static - Rich media, liquid No No No Yes Coleman et al.

In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, spaceflight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects.In free-floating liquid systems such as U937 cells growing in suspension (Bradamante et al. 2006), HUVEC cells adherent to Cytodex beads (Bradamante et al. 2006), or thyroid cells growing as spheroids (Warnke et al. 2016) rotating wall vessel, random positioning machines, and spaceflight had very similar effects. The ability of physical methods to manipulate yeast colony redox, apoptosis, and stress defense status is important at multiple levels of organismal biology. Gene deletion, although targeted to a single locus, will oftencause follow-on effects in multiple integrated pathways, especially when promoters are deleted (Park et al. 2011). Further, there are clinically important applications. Analysis of yeast survival pathways offers powerful techniques to address drug metabolic mechanisms for repurposing of pharmaceuticals (Lee et al. 2014), including identification of unique targets (Blackman et al. 2012) and buffering pathways required to respond to drugs. Further, yeast colony differentiation recapitulates many of the stratification mechanisms of tumorigenesis (Cap et al. 2012a ,d;B i r d s a l l et al. 2016). In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling,while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, thesephysical techniques are primed to substantially contribute toour understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging,and colony differentiation.

        "introduction": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understandmechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and a g i n g( C a pe ta l .2009a ;A y e re ta l . 2014;H e r k e re ta l . 2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based envelopebackTimothy G. Hammond hammondoutofofficeyahoo.com Extended author information available on the last page of the article.colonies (Cap et al. 2009a ). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colonyis dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification ofthe population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling(Cap et al. 2009a ). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays usinga deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al. 2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colonyon solid agar models many of the changes seen within solidtumors (Cap et al. 2009a ,2010, 2012a ,d). Yeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations.Received:10July2017Accepted:19December2017Publishedonline:29December2017 TheAuthor(s)2017.Thisarticleisanopenaccesspublication196 MicrogravitySci.Technol.(2018)30:195208 Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism e.g. increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and V olz 1979) and phenotype e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al. 1996). Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responsesof liquid culture yeast to real (e.g. spaceflight) microgravityand simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a ,b; Hammond et al.1999; Johanson et al. 2002; Nislow et al. 2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role inthe responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al.2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al. 2008a ). Little is known about the effects of spaceflight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al. 2009b, 2012b, c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony, begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly,thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity drivenconvection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeastcolony differentiation (Cap et al. 2009a ; Palkova et al. 1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seenin microgravity might affect this process. To answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (e.g. spaceflight) and in twoground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation andrandom positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during spaceflight (Hammond andHammond 2001; Lee et al. 2014;B i r d s a l le ta l . 2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cellsand gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al. 2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of gravity- vector-averaging, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al. 2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and truemicrogravity (Grimm et al. 2014), and controversy as towhether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al.2004; Murdoch et al. 2013; Wuest et al. 2017). Metabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance thisprocess colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar(Cap et al. 2009a ; Palkova et al. 1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays,tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients,we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media. Three major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table 1lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated indifferent strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies inground studies (Cap et al. 2012a ,d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered inliquid cultures of yeast in spaceflight (Walther et al. 1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation onthe ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al. 2016; Cap et al. 2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant 2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker 2004). Second, we evaluated the dependence of two stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, on the stress promoters,Msn4 and Sfp1 (Johanson et al. 2002). We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during spaceflight that differs from ground-based controls(Coleman et al. 2008a ). Third, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence ofthese outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al.2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process arenot known. We have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giantyeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al. 2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of spaceflightas well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning. Defining the utility of microgravity andmicrogravity simulations is confounded by use of differentmicrogravity simulations, different media, and differentMicrogravitySci.Technol.(2018)30:195208 197 Table 1 Clones selected for study Standard name Systematic name Description Reason for selection ATO3 YDR384C Putative ammonium transporter Upregulated in the upper cells of giant yeast colonies INO1 YJL153C Inositol-3-phosphate synthase Upregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies TRR1 YDR353W ThioRedoxin Reductase Key control enzyme in redox which is altered in spaceflight BEM1 YBR200W Involved in budding Bud scarring is altered in space- flight in liquid cultures EDC3 YEL015W Enhancer of mRNA DeCapping Constitutive control RPL34B YIL052C Stress response gene Upregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies; Dependence o nM s n 4a n dS f p 1i sa l t e r e di n microgravity in liquid cultures SSA4 YER103W Stress response gene Upregulated in the lower cells of giant yeast colonies; dependence o nM s n 4a n dS f p 1i sa l t e r e di nmicrogravity in liquid cultures Sfp1 YLR403W Stress-responsive transcriptional regulatorDifferential effect on SSA4 andRPL34B in microgravity vsground-based liquid cultures Msn4 YKL062W Stress-responsive transcriptional regulatorDifferential effect on SSA4 andRPL34B in microgravity ground-based liquid cultures outcomes.
