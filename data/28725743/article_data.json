Compared with normal gravity controls alterations to growth, culture density, biolm formation, aggregation, virulence, and changes in resistance to stress from acid, oxidative stress, heat shock, or antibiotics have been identi ed.210It is not possible to generalize or predict how a bacterial species will react to microgravity or LSMMG. An example is resistance to oxidative stress: exposure to LSMMG increased oxidative stress resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa11but decreased oxidative stress resistance ofStaphylococcus aureus.12Changes in the bacterial transcriptome1114are also induced by microgravity and LSMMG, and changes to the bacterial phenotype are likely due toalterations in the bacterial transcriptome. The diverse phenotypes induced by space ight or LSMMG27highlights the need to understand more about how different species of bacteria arealtered by microgravity and the importance of identifying key molecules that promote survival under the stress of microgravity. Mycobacterium marinum is a member of a family of closely related mycobacteria, most of which are pathogenic. They include Mycobacterium tuberculosis ,Mycobacterium avium, and Mycobac- terium ulcerans.15Although M. tuberculosis , the cause of human tuberculosis, live and replicate only in a host in nature,15,16 M. marinum and M. avium grow in macrophage and aquatic environments.16M. marinum grows at 28 35 C and infects poikilothermic hosts such as sh and frogs, but can infect humans resulting in granulomatous skin lesions, which pathologically areidentical to lesions produced by dermal M. tuberculosis . The pathogenic M. avium complex, which includes the subspecies avium ,paratuberculosis, and intracellulare , has been linked with hard-to-treat non-tuberculosis human pulmonary infections in non-immunocompromised17as well as immunocompromised individuals.18 1Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, USA;2Department of Medicine and Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, USA;3Department of Pathology and Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, USA;4Department of Biology, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, LA, USA and5Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, LA, USA.Correspondence: L Harrison (lclarylsuhsc.edu)Received 17 February 2016; revised 15 September 2016; accepted 17 September 2016www.nature.comnpjmgrav Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAM. marinum19and M. avium form bio lms and can grow in biolms in water distribution systems,20taps, and showerheads. Thirty percent of bio lms tested from showerheads across the USA contained M. avium even though they were linked to municipal water supplies treated with chlorine.21M. avium grown in a bio lm is more resistant to chlorine, even when the bio lm is disrupted.22 Pathogenic waterborne mycobacteria could pose a potential threat during space travel not only to astronaut health, but also tothe spacecraft environment and potable water. In fact, M. avium was identi ed in water samples taken from the Russian Mir space station.23 Pathogenic bacteria that have the potential to have increased antimicrobial resistance and virulence are a concern insidespacecraft because astronauts already have a compromised immune system, especially when in space for long periods of time.24,25Uncovering the signaling pathways that result in the altered physiology of bacteria has the potential to reveal new targets for drug development or disinfection that will be essential for long space ights. There are no published studies on the effect of microgravity or LSMMG on waterborne mycobacteria. Hfq has been identi ed as a factor regulating microgravity gene expression in P. aeruginosa,13 S. aureus ,12and Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium14 (S. typhimurium ), but mycobacteria do not encode Hfq.26 M. marinum is closely related genetically to M. tuberculosis and M. avium and has similar mechanisms of infection and survival inside host macrophage. Although all of these mycobacteriumspecies can grow in specialized medium in the laboratory,27 growth of M. marinum even at the lower temperature of 30 32 C is faster than M. tuberculosis27and M. avium.28M. marinum is also a lower risk (bisoafety level 2) to researchers. Hence M. marinum is a good model for pathogenic mycobacteria. The aim of this study was to identify factors involved in the adaptation of M. marinum to the LSMMG stressful environment and determine how LSMMG alters mycobacterium physiology.Two strains of M. marinum (1218R and LHM4) were used for this study. Strain 1218R was originally isolated from sh and LHM4 was generated from 1218R by integrating a plasmid into the genomethat encodes for kanamycin resistance and the red uorescent protein. Previous work studying the effect of LSMMG on bacteria with doubling times of o1 h exposed the bacteria to LSMMG for 10, 2920,3024 h11or 10 generations.31M. marinum has a doubling time of 6 7 h at 30 C and hence two exposure times to LSMMG or NG (short  40 h and long 4 days and  35 h) were selected to allow the bacteria to undergo multiple replication cycles duringthe experiments. The exposure protocol was designed so thatshort and long LSMMG- or NG-exposed cultures were in exponential phase and hence alterations to the transcriptome or resistance to treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), acid or gamma radiation were due to different exposure times to LSMMGand not due to different phases of growth. In summary, this work characterizes the growth, stress survival, and transcriptome of M. marinum grown under LSMMG and identi es nutrient deprivation as a signal involved in changes to gene expression and the sigma factor SigH as a factor modulating the LSMMG transcriptome in a waterborne mycobacterium. RESULTS The effect of LSMMG exposure time had to be assessed with bacteria in the same phase of growth, as we found stressresistance altered as the M. marinum progressed from early to late exponential phase (data not shown) and it would be expected that the transcriptome of replicating bacteria is verydifferent from bacteria in stationary phase. For the short exposure, M. marinum were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) of 0.002 at the initiation of the high aspect ratio vessel(HARV) culture to make sure that the bacteria would be inexponential phase (OD 600 0.1 0.2) after  40 h. This exposure time allowed  6 generations. For the longer exposure time, M. marinum were subjected to 4 days of growth under LSMMG or NG, the bacteria removed from the HARV, re-diluted infresh medium and the LSMMG or NG exposure continued in newHARVs for a further  35 h (see Materials and Methods for full details). LSMMG did not alter aggregation of M. marinum Previous published studies observed increased aggregation of bacteria exposed to microgravity or LSMMG. 4,12,14Mycobacterium under normal laboratory conditions grow as aggregates andstandard culture procedure27,32uses Tween 80 in the medium to minimize clumping. Even in the presence of 0.2 Tween 80, M. marinum still aggregate. Cultures exposed to NG or LSMMG for various times were examined by microscopy to determinewhether exposure to LSMMG altered aggregation. Similar size aggregates were detected in both LSMMG and NG cultures (Supplementary Figure 1A), so growth under LSMMG and standardculture medium did not increase clumping of M. marinum .T o determine whether the Tween 80 in the culture medium prevented the detection of structure alterations under LSMMG,1218R and LHM4 were grown initially in a tube with 0.2 Tween80 until OD 600 1 in the rotating incubator as described in the Materials and Methods section. The cultures were then diluted to OD 6000.002 in growth medium without Tween 80. One dilution for each strain was used to prepare two 50 ml HARVs and a tubeculture. The cultures in the tube and HARVs were grown for 67 h (LHM4) or 69 h (1218R). The tube was incubated in the rotating incubator at 120 r.p.m. and the HARVs were grown under NG orLSMMG. The culture in the tube grew as small clumps (data notshown) and clumps were also visible in the HARV cultures. When the culture was removed from the HARVs it was not possible to determine the optical density of the culture as bacteria hadadhered to the base of the HARV grown under NG, preventing an accurate measurement. Samples of each culture were examined by microscopy (Supplementary Figure 1B and C) and cording ofthe mycobacterium was seen in all cultures. This cording structureis known to form in broth as well as bio lms. 19,33Under the conditions examined, there was no obvious difference between the NG and LSMMG cultures. Further studies are required todetermine whether there are subtle structure differences betweenthe cords or whether cord formation is accelerated under LSMMG. As growth in the absence of Tween 80 prevents accurate measurements of culture density and total recovery of the culturefrom the HARVs, all further studies were performed in the presence of 0.2 Tween 80. M. marinum grown under LSMMG transition from exponential phase earlier than NG-exposed M. marinum Thirteen independent cultures of LHM4 and three independent cultures of 1218R were grown continuously for 4 days in 10 mlHARVs under LSMMG or NG and signi cantly different OD 600were obtained for LSMMG compared with NG cultures (Figure 1a). The OD 600of the LSMMG culture was reduced by at least 50 compared with the NG culture. To determine in more detail howgrowth was altered by LSMMG, growth studies of LHM4 (Figure 1b) and 1218R (Figure 1c) were performed over a period of 150 h where the OD 600was monitored by removal of a sample of the culture at the different time points. Experiments wereperformed in triplicate and all data points from these experiments were pooled and plotted to examine the effect of LSMMG on growth (Figure 1b and c). The LSMMG cultures of LHM4 and 1218Rhad slightly lower OD 600compared with the NG culture at  37 h after culture initiation and this difference increased with time (Figure 1e and f). This was very consistent and detected in allexperiments with both M. marinum strains. A similar result wasEffect of LSMMG on M. marinum CF Abshire et al 2 npj Microgravity (2016) 16038 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAfound when LHM4 colony forming units per ml (CFU ml) was plotted against time (Supplementary Figure 2). As the OD 600 measurements for the NG cultures began to plateau at around90 h, indicating an exit from logarithmic growth, the data between 37 and 70 h were considered (Figure 1e and f). Regression analyses determined that during this time period that the data were signi cantly different ( Po0.0001) for the LSMMG and NG cultures of LHM4 and 1218R. To examine the extent of change on growth during this transition from exponential phase, the doubling times during this time period were calculated from Figure 1e and f: doubling times were 10 h (LHM4) and 11 h (1218R) for NG cultures, and 15.5 h (LHM4) and 16 h (1218R) for LSMMG cultures. The LSMMG culture did eventually reach a similar culture density to the NG culture at later time points (Figure 1b).As OD 600can be in uenced by size of the bacteria, the diameter and length of 50 bacteria in an LHM4 culture grown for 4 daysunder LSMMG (OD 600 1.3) or NG (OD 600 2.3) were determined. No statistical signi cant difference was found for the diameter (NG  0.72  0.05 m, LSMMG  0.73  0.07 m) or the length (NG  2.7  0.45 m, LSMMG  2.7  0.5 m) between the two cultures. Published studies have determined that LSMMG induces oxidative stress genes in bacteria;30suggesting LSMMG disturbs the normal redox environment. Catalase breaks down H 2O2and is present in standard M. tuberculosis medium (3 gml). Growth experiments for 1218R were therefore performed with medium containing catalase (3 gml) to remove extracellular H 2O2.N o change in growth was detected when the medium contained0123456 LHM4 1218ROD600NG LSMMG p  0.0001p  0.0049 0.0010.010.1110 0 50 100 150NG LSMMG Time in HoursOD600LHM4OD600OD6001218R 0.0010.010.1110 0 50 100 150NG LSMMG Time in Hours 0.1110 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75LHM4 Time in HoursNG LSMMG R2 0.93 R2 0.90 OD6000.0010.010.1110 05 0 1 0 0 1 5 01218R with catalase NG LSMMG Time in Hours 0.1110 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 Time in Hours1218R NG LSMMG R2 0.87 R2 0.97OD600 Figure 1. Growth under LSMMG alters culture density of M. marinum . LHM4 and 1218R was grown in 10 ml HARVs under NG or LSMMG for 4 days continuously and the OD 600determined. The data from 13 HARVs for LHM4 and 3 HARVs for 1218R for each condition was used to obtain the average and s.d. ( a). OD 600was monitored for LHM4 ( b) and 1218R ( c) in 50 ml HARVs. At each time point, a small culture volume (12 ml) was removed to measure OD 600and the volume replaced with fresh medium (2 4 total volume). Strain 1218R was also grown in medium with catalase ( d). Three independent experiments were performed for each strain and growth condition. As data were not gathered at the exact time point in each experiment, all the data points were pooled for a strain and condition and are shown graphically ( bd). A transition from exponential phase was detected at  37 h in LSMMG cultures compared with NG cultures. The data between 37 and 70 h forthe three experiments were plotted ( e,f) and regression analysis performed, demonstrating that the increase in OD 600during this time period was statistically different when the bacteria were grown under NG and LSMMG ( Po0.0001).Effect of LSMMG on M. marinum CF Abshire et al 3 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2016) 16038catalase, which suggests extracellular H 2O2did not hinder growth under LSMMG (Figure 1d). M. marinum transcriptome response to LSMMG RNA samples isolated from triplicate independent cultures of 1218R grown under LSMMG or NG cultures for the short or longexposure times were used for RNA-Seq analyses, and 6 10 million reads were sequenced for each biological sample (SupplementaryTable 1). RNA-Seq using 5 10 million non-rRNA reads has previously been found to provide suf cient depth of sequencing to detect the majority of alterations in bacterial gene expression. 34 Following transcript quanti cation a comparison of LSMMG with NG after short or long exposure times (Supplementary ExcelWorksheets 1 and 2) identi ed 562 and 328 genes, respectively, with signi cantly altered transcript levels. From the 10 categories of mycobacterial genes (http:mycobrowser.ep .chmarinolist. html), the intermediary metabolism and respiration category hadthe greatest number of genes with signi cant transcript changes (Supplementary Table 2). To determine the genes with the greatest physiological relevance to growth under LSMMG the real fold change (RFC)was calculated (Supplementary Excel Worksheets). Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was also performed for9 different genes and the majority of the LSMMGNG fold changesin expression determined by RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR were similar(Supplementary Table 3). The genes with the greatest RNA-Seq RFC (top 10) after short and long exposure times are shown in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5. Genes that changed expression 1.5-fold (RFC 0.67 or 1.5) by RNA-Seq were identi ed and the log 10RFC plotted for the genes according to category (Figure 2). The category with the greatest number of genes for LSMMG versus NG at each exposure time (Figure 2a and b) was intermediary metabolism, and there was an even distribution of genes with increased and decreased expression. The categories of genes relating to the cell wall and the conserved hypotheticals had the next highest number of genes that signi cantly changed. Even though these categories also had an even distribution of genes with increased and decreased expression (Figure 2a and b), some genes relating tothese two categories had the highest RFC, especially after a short exposure to LSMMG (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Unfortu- nately the function of the conserved hypothetical genes is unknown. The majority of genes involved in the information pathway and lipid metabolism categories decreased expression, whereas the genes in the PEPPE and virulence categories increased expression (Figure 2a and b). There were also genes in the regulatory protein category that were signi cantly changed by LSMMG, but genes were again evenly distributed for increased and decreased expression.

Transcriptional pro les were compared between 1218R grown at LSMMG and NG for 40 h ( a, LSMMGNG) or 4 days  35 h ( b, LSMMGNG) and between 1218R grown under LSMMG for the two time periods (c, 4 days  35 h40 h). The signi cant ( Po0.05) changes in transcript levels were identi ed. The real fold change (RFC) is the ratio of the normalized mean count values for LSMMG divided by the normalized mean count values for NG. The genes that changed 1.5-fold were assigned to categories (1 9) and the distribution of the RFC is shown graphically. No genes were signi cantly altered 1.5-fold in the insertion sequences and phage category and so this category is not included. The mean value for the RFC for a category is marked by the black spot and the number of genes in the category is shown in parentheses.Effect of LSMMG on M. marinum CF Abshire et al 4 npj Microgravity (2016) 16038 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAcompared, it was evident that gene expression continued to change with greater exposure to LSMMG (Figure 2c), and the categories for cell wall, intermediary metabolism, PEPPE, and virulence increased expression. To identify genes involved in adaptation to LSMMG, genes were considered that signi cantly changed 1.5-fold at both the short and long exposure time points (Table 1). The changes for themajority of these 97 genes were very similar at the two time points. Transcript changes include a  2-fold decrease for ribosomal proteins and a decrease for most of the genes incategories related to lipid metabolism and intermediary metabo-lism (Table 1). The greatest changes were in genes encodingchaperone proteins. Expression of cell metabolism genes Groups of genes linked with speci c metabolic pathways were examined using hierarchical clustering in GeneSifter to determine whether gene expression changes were linked to growth underLSMMG. Hierarchical clustering of all the LSMMG samples suggestschanges in gene expression were linked to LSMMG.

The majority of these pathways had few signi cant changes or changes not related to LSMMG (data not shown). An example is ETC, where 22 genes had signi cant alterations but the changes were not linked to growth under LSMMG (SupplementaryFigure 3A). However, 1719 TCA genes had altered expressionlinked to LSMMG (Supplementary Figure 3B). Transcript levels foraconitase decreased after short exposure to LSMMG. Succinatedehydrogenase is also a TCA enzyme, but also forms complex II of the ETC. 35,36There are two forms of succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh1 and Sdh2) and transcript levels of 3 ( sdhB-D ) of the four genes encoding Sdh2 decreased at the short exposure time point,while transcripts from sdhB and sdhD decreased after long exposure. There was no change in expression of the genesencoding Sdh1. Proline oxidation can also donate electrons to ETC. 36Transcripts from MMAR_4252 (putA, proline dehydrogenase) and MMAR_4253 (pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase) were increased 2 4-fold by LSMMG after the short exposure time (Supplementary Worksheets 1 and 2). After the long exposuretime, only MMAR_4252 was increased 2.6-fold (Table 1). Isocitrate lyase (Icl) is an enzyme that connects the TCA and glyoxylate cycle and transcript levels from icl(MMAR_0792 ) decreased by  10-fold in LSMMG bacteria after the long exposure time (SupplementaryTable 5). Transcription of genes involved in lipid degradation and catabolism of fatty acids were altered signi cantly in LSMMG bacteria. We identi ed 104 genes in M. marinum involved in lipid degradation and 53 had 1.5-fold signi cant change in transcript levels after growth under LSMMG (Figure 3a). Of the 53 genes, 16 had decreased expression and 37 had increased expression, the majority of which encode enzymes involved in fatty acid  oxidation. Fatty acids are also used for polyketide lipid synthesis ofphenolic glycolipids and phthiocerol dimycocerosates, mycolicacid (MA) synthesis, production of cell membrane phospholipids,as well as production of carbon stores in the form of triacylglycerol. 37Although there were no alterations in expression of genes encoding triacylglycerol synthase ( MMAR_2634, MMAR_2598, MMAR_1519 and MMAR_1157 ), genes involved in polyketide lipid synthesis ( fadD22 and pks151 ) were decreased 1.5- to 2-fold (Supplementary Excel Worksheets 1 and 2) andmultiple genes38encoding proteins involved in MA synthesis were also decreased (Table 1 and Figure 3b). Two genes ( desA3 and desA3_2 ) encoding membrane-bound desaturases showed increased expression at both time points in LSMMG bacteria(Table 1 and Figure 3b). These desaturases are involved in oleicacid production and potentially the production of cis doublebonds in meromycolic acids. 38 Mycobactins chelate iron from the environment and are also known to be important for mycobacterial growth during infectionof macrophage.39Sixteen genes involved in mycobactin synthesis were identi ed and six increased expression after LSMMG exposure for 4 days and  35 h (Figure 3c). SigH: a possible regulator of the mycobacteria LSMMG response sigH transcript levels increased 1.5-fold at both time points (Table 1). SigH is known to regulate chaperone encodinggenes40,41(hspand the dnaK ,dnaJ ,grpE and hspR operon) and hsp transcript levels increased at both time points (Table 1). Transcripts from all the dnaK operon genes increased after  40 h of LSMMG exposure (Supplementary Table 4 and Excel Worksheet1), while only transcripts from dnaK and hspR increased after LSMMG exposure for 4 days and  35 h (Supplementary Table 5and Excel Worksheet 2). M. tuberculosis SigH directlyindirectly regulated genes have been identi ed in a study 41where wild-type and sigH mutant M. tuberculosis were allowed to recover after diamide treatment: RNA analysis identi ed 44 genes at 0 min and 91 genes at 30 min of recovery as SigH-regulated genes. Weidenti ed the M. marinum orthologs of these genes (40 at 0 min and 78 at 30 min) and using GeneSifter determined that 450 of these orthologs altered expression signi cantly after growth under LSMMG (Figure 4). Changes in expression of genes related to the enduring hypoxic response and the nutrient starvation response The enduring hypoxic response (EHR)42and the relA nutrient starvation response43are well characterized in M. tuberculosis .W e identi ed 147 M. marinum orthologs from the 230 M. tuberculosis genes involved in EHR, and 105 M. marinum orthologs from the 147M. tuberculosis genes involved in the nutrient starvation response. These orthologs (58 for EHR and 46 for nutrient starvation response) were also found to signi cantly alter expression 1.5-fold due to LSMMG (Figure 5). The EHR genes that overlap with the LSMMG changes in M. marinum (Figure 5a) include sigH and SigH-regulated genes. For M. tuberculosis , all the genes in Figure 5a increase expression during EHR, whereas 25 increased transcript levels under LSMMG. A major group ofoverlapping genes between the nutrient starvation response in M. tuberculosis and the LSMMG response in M. marinum are related to translation. The nutrient starvation response includes 23translation-related genes and 22 decrease expression during theresponse. There are 21 corresponding M. marinum orthologs, 17 changed expression in M. marinum under LSMMG and 16 decreased expression (Figure 5b and Table 1). Comparison of M. marinum exposed to LSMMG and P. aeruginosa exposed to space ight or LSMMG During space ight, 167 genes were differentially regulated in P. aeruginosa and Hfq was identi ed as a transcription regulator of the bacterial response to microgravity 13and LSMMG.11Mycobac- teria do not have a gene encoding Hfq, but there is overlap in thelists of genes that are differentially regulated in P. aeruginosa exposed to space ight or LSMMG and M. marinum subjected to LSMMG (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). A hypergeometric distribution test was performed to determine whether the numberof genes found to overlap were signi cant or could have occurred by chance. The number of protein coding sequences in M. marinum is 5,452 (refs 15,44) and from the short exposure to LSMMG there were 562 signi cant changes, of which 38 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to space ight (where 167 changes were detected) and 47 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to LSMMG (where 330 changes were detected). From thelong exposure of M. marinum to LSMMG, there were 328 signi cant changes, of which 38 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to space ight and 34 overlapped with P. aeruginosa exposed to LSMMG. The number of overlapping genes in eachcase was found to be signi cant (short exposure M. marinum and space ight P. aeruginosa representation factor 2.2, Po1.513e 6, short exposure M. marinum and LSMMG P. aeruginosa representa- tion factor 1.4, Po0.012, long exposure M. marinum and space ight P. aeruginosa representation factor 3.8, Po2.17e13, long exposure M. marinum and LSMMG P. aeruginosa representa- tion factor 1.7, Po0.001). When comparing the LSMMG M. marinum data with the space ight data from P. aeruginosa , the largest overlap in downregulated genes encode ribosomal proteins and other common downregulated genes produce proteins involved intranscription and translation. Genes encoding the metabolicenzymes Icl and Sdh2 are also downregulated in both organisms, suggesting similar downregulation of metabolic pathways. Interestingly there were no genes with decreased transcript levelsdetected for P. aeruginosa grown under LSMMG, but 330 transcript levels increased by 1.5-fold. 11From this list a number of transcripts encoding proteins of similar function wereincreased in P. aeruginosa subjected to LSMMG but decreased inEffect of LSMMG on M. marinum CF Abshire et al 6 npj Microgravity (2016) 16038 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASALipid Degradation Genes NG Short 2 NG Short 1 NG Short 3 NG Long 2 NG Long 1NG Long 3 LSMMG Short 1 LSMMG Short 2 LSMMG Short 3LSMMG Long 1 LSMMG Long 2 LSMMG Long 3 fadE3_2MMAR_4027 fadD9_1 ltp2 fadE12_3 fadE25_2 fadB4 fadE18_1 fadE34_1 fadBfadD2 fadD5 MMAR_4011 fadD15 fadE4echA8_2 fadD22 MMAR_4032 MMAR_4030 MMAR_4031 MMAR_0466 echA8_6 fadE21 MMAR_0697 fadE36_1 fadD15_1 MMAR_0468 fadE1 fadE10 fadE7 fadE2 fadA3 fadE6 fadE2_1 fadD11fadD12fadE31 MMAR_4748 fadD9 fadE23 fadE24 fadD13 fadD10 MMAR_4751 fadE5 MMAR_4749 echA1_1 fadA6_3fadD3 fadE30 fadA fadD4 fadE12accD4_1 mmpL3 Mycolic Acid Synthesis Genes NG Short 2NG Short 1NG Short 3 NG Long 2NG Long 1NG Long 3LSMMG Short 1 LSMMG Short 2 LSMMG Short 3 LSMMG Long 1 LSMMG Long 2LSMMG Long 3 desA3 kasBaccA3 echA10 accD2 accA2 accD1 accA1 fas accD6 kasA acpM fabD pks13 fadD32 Mycobactin Genes LSMMG Long 3NG Short 2 NG Short 1 NG Short 3 NG Long 2NG Long 1 NG Long 3LSMMG Short 1 LSMMG Short 2 LSMMG Short 3 LSMMG Long 1 LSMMG Long 2 mbtA mbtI mbtD mbtG mbtC mbtE 02 -2 Log Figure 3.

These include transcripts for 13 ribosomal proteins, Sdh2 ( sdhB and sdhD ), Icl, RNA polymerase alpha subunit ( rpoA ) and elongation factor Ts ( tsf). A common group of genes with increased transcript levels in LSMMG M. marinum and P. aeruginosa were the stress response genes for heat shock and chaperone proteins. Transcriptome data therefore suggest that M. marinum grown under LSMMG exhibit similar stress responses as LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa , but have transcriptional, translational, and metabolic alterations similar to space ight-exposed P. aeruginosa . Survival of LHM4 NG- and LSMMG-exposed cultures to stressful conditions Ionizing radiation and H 2O2produce an oxidizing environment in cells. Compared with NG, LSMMG-exposed bacteria showedno change in resistance to ionizing radiation (Figure 6a),but were more sensitive to H 2O2(Figure 6b) with the sensitivity increasing with longer exposure to LSMMG. LHM4 exposed to NG and LSMMG for 4 days and  35 h were also tested forsensitivity to pH 3.5 for up to 4 h and no cell death occurred (Figure 6c). DISCUSSION Previous studies examining liquid bacterial growth during space travel3or LSMMG2,3have found species-speci c alterations: LSMMG-grown S. typhimurium had decreased doubling time in minimal medium,29Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis reached higher cell densities and had increased growth rate during space ight compared with ground controls,45while S. aureus achieved higher cell densities in the normal gravity controlcompared with the LSMMG culture.12In our study, in a 4-day continuous growth culture, M. marinum subjected to NG achieved a higher cell density than the LSMMG culture. As the size of thebacteria did not change and aggregates were disrupted before optical density measurements were determined, the lower LSMMG cell density was likely due to an alteration in growth. Amore detailed examination of the growth indicated an earlytransition of the LSMMG bacteria from exponential phase resulting in a slowing of growth. Even though RNA-Seq analysis was performed at the point where this transition was just detectable,the slowing of growth is apparent from changes in thetranscriptome. MA synthesis is linked to new membrane synthesis and cell wall expansion 38and is needed for bacterial cell division, and MA synthesis gene transcript levels decreased  3-fold underLSMMG. During exponential growth there is also a linear relation- ship between bacterial growth rate and the number of ribosomes in a cell.46The slower growing LSMMG M. marinum culture had  2-fold reduction in transcripts of multiple ribosomal proteins,indicating a downregulation of translation. P. aeruginosa13and S. typhimurium14cultured during space ight also had decreased ribosomal protein transcripts, but growth studies were notperformed for these bacteria. Transcriptome changes imply a nutrient-deprived environment under LSMMG Forty-six M. marinum orthologs of the M. tuberculosis relA nutrient starvation response genes43had expression changes linked to LSMMG. Nutrient starvation results in decreased growth rate,translation, lipid biosynthesis (e.g., MA synthesis), and down-regulation of metabolism. 43,47These phenotypes were also implied from the transcriptome data for LSMMG-exposed M. marinum . Key bacterial metabolic pathways include -oxidation of fatty acids, ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate and glyoxylate cycles.35In LSMMG M. marinum , a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid degradation increased expression, but icl transcript levels decreased  10-fold after long exposure toLSMMG. Icl converts isocitrate into glyoxylate, and glyoxylate combined with acetyl CoA from oxidation of fatty acids produces malate for the glyoxylate cycle.35Also transcript levels decreased 3 6-fold in LSMMG M. marinum for the WhiB3 transcription regulator, which is implicated in the adaptation ofmycobacteria to growth on long-chain fatty acids.48The transcriptome data therefore suggest energy generation fromfatty acids was depressed in LSMMG M. marinum . Decreased transcript levels of genes encoding Sdh2 and aconitase suggest that ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate andglyoxylate cycles are depressed in LSMMG M. marinum . Sdh2 is an enzyme that is essential for growth and Sdh1 cannot substitute for all activities of Sdh2 (ref. 49), which links oxidative phosphoryla- tion energy production to carbon metabolism. 36Succinate oxidation generates electrons for ETC, but in mycobacteria prolineoxidation can substitute for succinate oxidation under carbonstarvation and slow growth conditions. 36The transcriptome data indicate that M. marinum increased proline oxidation under LSMMG; transcript levels increased for proline oxidation enzymes when transcript levels from the Sdh2 genes decreased. Sdh1 and 2levels in Mycobacterium smegmatis have been linked to energy availability and oxygen levels: under energy-limiting conditionsSdh2 is downregulated and Sdh1 is upregulated, and this is reversed under oxygen-limiting conditions. 36Even though in our study, the genes encoding Sdh1 did not alter expressionsigni cantly, the transcript changes for Sdh2 and the proline oxidation enzymes suggest that LSMMG M. marinum could still produce energy by ETC, and were sensing a carbon-starvedenergy-limiting environment. Taken together, the slower growth and the transcriptome data relating to translation and metabolism suggest that LSMMGsimulates nutrient deprivation conditions in M. marinum . Fluid dynamics in cultures under microgravity or LSMMG are different from NG cultures. 8,11Crabb et al.11examined uid mixing in HARVs subjected to NG and LSMMG by adding a drop of crystalviolet to the uid-lled vessels. This experiment demonstrated different mixing rates under the two conditions: even after 12 hthe crystal violet had dispersed only around the circumference of the HARV subjected to LSMMG, while complete dispersal had occurred under NG. This decreased mixing and low uid shear under LSMMG and the fact that M. marinum are non-motile in liquid culture results in the environment immediately around thebacterium being in uenced more by diffusion. Under LSMMG, diffusion is likely the main method moving nutrients to and waste products away from the bacterium. The uid dynamics in the LSMMG culture could therefore generate a local nutrient-deprivedcondition. This idea is also supported by increased transcript levelsof the WhiB7 transcription regulator and the mycobactin synthesisgenes after long exposure to LSMMG. whiB7 is induced by nutrient starvation and growth under low-iron conditions, 50,51while mycobactin synthesis genes are induced under iron-restricted conditions.52This is very relevant to cultures in potable water during space ight, which is where waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria could be found. In fact, M. avium 16s rRNA was identi ed by PCR ampli cation in three different water condensa- tion samples from the Mir space station.23 Stress response genes Even though there were LSMMG-linked transcript alterations related to M. tuberculosis EHR, the metabolic transcriptome data does not suggest the LSMMG M. marinum were under hypoxia. Many of the EHR genes that changed were stress response genesand included sigH, chaperone and heat-shock-regulated genes. SigH is one of 18 sigma factors in M. marinum53and sigma factors function in promoter sequence recognition; directing initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase.54sigH was the only sigma factor gene to increase expression under LSMMG at both the short andEffect of LSMMG on M. marinum CF Abshire et al 10 npj Microgravity (2016) 16038 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAlong exposure times. Transcript levels of genes regulated directly or indirectly by SigH also changed signi cantly due to LSMMG exposure. SigH autoregulates its expression by binding to its own promoter and increasing transcription, and SigH is post-translationally regulated by RshA and PknB. RshA binds to SigH and prevents SigH from binding to RNA polymerase and SigH- RshA binding is disrupted by heat or redox stress, 55as well asphosphorylation by PknB.56Smallno changes were detected in rshA and pknB transcript levels in LSMMG M. marinum , but conditions inside the LSMMG mycobacteria could have induced a substantial activity change in SigH by disrupting binding to RshA.A 1.5-fold increase in the sigH transcript is implicated in the 40- fold increase in hsptranscript after long exposure to LSMMG. SigH is also required for the induction of sigB and sigE,54and transcript levels from these genes increased after exposure toLSMMG for 4 days and  35 h albeit by a small amount (Figure 4).SigE has been implicated in the repression of icl, 57so increased SigE expression after the long exposure time to LSMMG may explain the decrease in the icltranscript. SigH is known to be involved in the response of mycobacteria to oxidative stress as well as heat shock. Therefore M. marinum exposed to LSMMG would be expected to be resistant to H 2O2. AlgU is another alternate sigma factor involved in heat shock andoxidative stress that has been implicated in the LSMMG response ofP. aeruginosa11and LSMMG-exposed P. aeruginosa were more resistant to H 2O2treatment.11However, LSMMG-exposed LHM4 were more sensitive to H 2O2in our study. LHM4 was derived from 1218R by integration of an RFP-expressing plasmid (pDEAM2) at the attB site in the genome. The attB site is used to integrate plasmids into mycobacterium, as integration does not disrupt anygenes.58Previous studies have demonstrated that a M. marinum strain similar to LHM4 that was derived by pDEAM2 integration into 1218R had similar growth characteristics and virulence in Medaka sh to 1218R.59We also determined that LHM4 and 1218R had similar growth characteristics under LSMMG. Therefore, LSMMG-exposed 1218R would be expected to be sensitive to H2O2. Interestingly, S. aureus ,S. typhimurium ,E. coli ,Enterobacter cloacae , and Citrobacter freundii grown under LSMMG have also been found to be more sensitive to H 2O2than NG controls.12,60A second group using S. typhimurium didnd that LSMMG induced resistance to H 2O2and that resistance involved induction of catalase.30Sensitivity to H 2O2could be altered by the availability of detoxi cation enzymes (catalase and alkyl hydroperoxidases), proteins involved in repairing oxidized proteins (thioredoxins and methionine sulfoxide reductases) or redox buffers such asmycothiol and ergothioneine.51Transcript levels of the genes encoding these proteins or the enzymes involved in the synthesis of mycothiol and ergothioneine did not signi cantly decrease in LSMMG M. marinum , which suggests these protection mechan- isms were not compromised compared with the NG control. In fact, transcriptome data indicate that the trxB1 transcript, which encodes one of the thioredoxins, increased by 4-fold after the longexposure time. Cysteine, which is key to many of the protectingenzymescompounds, was also being conserved and production increased: the transcript of cysteine desulfurase decreased by 2-fold after LSMMG exposure and the cysK2 transcript increased  4-fold after the long exposure to LSMMG. Even though LSMMGM. marinum were more sensitive to H 2O2, they had no change in sensitivity to killing by ionizing radiation compared with the NG control. Ionizing radiation and H 2O2are similar in that they both induce oxidative stress and generate similar types of DNA damage61and DNA is a critical target in cells for cell killing. Lack of enhanced killing by radiation suggests the increased sensitivityto H 2O2was due to a different mechanism of radical formation cell killing by H 2O2in LSMMG bacteria that could not be defended against by the SigH response. In mycobacteria, the outer cell wall is the rst line of defense against H 2O2. This is not the case for ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy in themolecules of the cell and generates DNA damage by depositing energy directly on the DNA or by depositing energy in water, which produces hydroxyl radicals that then induce DNAdamage. 62The energy deposited by the radiation can also generate lipid peroxides and oxidation of protein molecules, but the delivery of the energy to the macromolecules is not impededby the structures surrounding or within the bacterium.

The average and s.d. are shown.

H 2O2can pass through lipid bilayers but is broken down to hydroxyl radicals bythe Fenton reaction, which requires Fe2(ref. 63). The hydroxyl radicals can generate lipid peroxides from reaction with lipids in the cell wall that can diffuse and generate DNA damage.64The composition of the cell wall and the iron content of the cell couldtherefore modify radical formation and alter the sensitivity of thecell to H 2O2. There were a substantial number of transcript changes in LSMMG M. marinum related to the cell wall. Transcripts of genes related to MA and phenolic glycolipid synthesis were decreased, while transcripts encoding proteins involved in modifying the types of MA were increased. LSMMG-exposedM. marinum also had an increase in transcripts related to mycobactin synthesis and mycobactins bind iron from theenvironment and transport the charged iron across the hydro-phobic cell wall. 39An increase in mycobactin synthesis could therefore increase iron content in the mycobacterium. Alterations to mycobactin synthesis and to the composition of the mycobacterium cell wall could therefore explain why theLSMMG-exposed mycobacterium, even with the sigH operon response, were more sensitive to H 2O2but not ionizing radiation. The changes at the cell wall did not sensitize the LSMMG M. marinum to pH 3.5 and so cell wall lipid composition may not inuence acid resistance. Other bacteria exposed to LSMMG have also been found not to have increased sensitivity to killing byacid60even though they were more sensitive to H 2O2. Recently, M. tuberculosis acid resistance was linked to asparagine metabolism.65An asparagine transporter AnsP2 imports aspar- agine into the bacterium where asparaginase AnsA breaks downasparagine to aspartate with the production of ammonia. Theammonia buffers hydrogen ions by forming NH 4. AnsA is also secreted to perform this reaction in the environment around themycobacterium. In M. marinum , AnsP2 is encoded by MMAR_0627 and AnsA is encoded by MMAR_2360 . Transcript levels of these genes did not alter during exposure to LSMMG and hence theability to produce ammonia may not have changed in LSMMG-exposed M. marinum . This may explain why LSMMG-exposed M. marinum were not more sensitive to killing by acid. Could LSMMG alter the virulence of M. marinum ? sigB,Eand Has well as hsp and dnaK are induced when M. marinum infect sh or are ingested by mosquito larvae, 53and M. marinum ingested by mosquito larvae are more virulent in sh compared with in vitro cultured M. marinum.59Exposure to the mosquito larvae gut therefore primes the M. marinum for survival inside sh macrophage. The hspgene is also the most induced M. tuberculosis gene during macrophage infection,52and sigH mutants of M. tuberculosis and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis have reduced survival in animal infection models.66,67Induction of the SigH stress response by LSMMG before infection should aid survival of mycobacteria in macrophage and potentially increase virulence. The transcriptome of LSMMG M. marinum is also similar to mycobacteria inside macrophage in that they have alteredgrowth and metabolism to survive under a nutrient- and iron-starved environment. 39,43,52LSMMG increased transcripts involved in lipid degradation and mycobacteria inside macrophage use host lipids for a source of energy.37However, Icl expression would need to increase; studies have shown that Icl is essential toconnect lipid degradation with the glyoxylate shunt, and isrequired for survival in animals. 35Even though LSMMG M. marinum do have a number of adaptations that would prime them for increased virulence, the enhanced killing by H 2O2is likely to be detrimental for bacterial survival inside macrophage. Future studies examining LSMMG- or space ight-exposed M. marinum survival inside macrophage and sh are needed to determine whether M. marinum in space could pose a risk to the health ofastronauts. As M. marinum is an accepted model of waterborne mycobacteria and M. tuberculosis , these results do have implica- tions for other pathogenic mycobacteria exposed to LSMMG asthey may respond with similar transcriptome changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and culture M. marinum strain 1218R,53a strain isolated from infected sh, and a derivative of this strain, LHM4, were used for this study. LHM4 carries an integrated plasmid pDEAM2, which encodes red uorescent protein and confers kanamycin resistance. Bacteria were grown in the dark at 30 C in tubes in a rotating incubator (120 r.p.m.)27or in HARVs attached to a rotating cell culture system (RCCS, Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA) in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with ADS (5 BSA Fraction V, 2 Dextrose, 0.81 NaCl) to 10, 0.5 glycerol, 100g cycloheximideml, and 0.2 Tween 80. Cultures were also grown on solid Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented with 10 ADS, 0.5 glycerol, and 100 g cycloheximideml. LHM4 cultures also contained 20g kanamycinml. To initiate cultures, solid medium was inoculated from a frozen stock and incubated for  7 days to obtain colonies. Colonies were used to inoculate tube cultures (3 ml). The tube cultures were grown for 5  7 days to an OD 600 1. This tube culture was then diluted to OD 6000.0005 or 0.002 before growth in 10 or 50 ml HARVs, respectively. The lower OD 600of the culture at the start of growth in the 10 ml HARVs prevented the cultures from being at saturation density for the majority of the 4-day exposure time. For the short exposure time, the cultures were grown in 50 ml HARVs. For the long exposure, the cultures were grown in 10 ml HARVs for 4 days and then re-diluted to OD 6000.002 in 50 ml HARVs for another  35 h. For NG, HARVs were rotated (25 r.p.m.) on an axis parallel to the direction of gravitational force, while they were rotated (25 r.p.m.) on an axis perpendicular to the direction of the gravitational force for LSMMG.3 Growth studies For the continuous growth studies, one large volume of OD 6000.0005 culture was prepared from an initiating tube culture and split between two10 ml HARVs: one was subjected to NG and the other to LSMMG. After 4 days the cultures were removed and the OD 600was determined. The statistical difference between the LSMMG and NG cultures was tested by a T-test performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Gary, NC, USA). To examine culture density during exponential growth, one large volume of OD 6000.002 culture was prepared from an initiating tube culture and split between two 50 ml HARVs: one was subjected to NG and the other to LSMMG. Where speci ed, 3 g catalaseml (0.06 Uml; ThermoFisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA, USA) was included. Bacteria were grown for  150 h but the HARVs were stopped to remove samples (1 2 ml). Liquid medium was added to the HARV to replace the removed sample volume (2 4 of the volume) to maintain a low-shear environment. In order to obtain accurate OD 600and CFU measurements, a disaggregation procedure was used: SDS ( nal concentration 0.01) was added; the culture was passed through a 27.5 gauge needle and either vortexed before measurement of the OD 600or preparation of dilutions, or the bacteria were allowed to settle for 5 min before growth on solid medium. Use of the syringe needle, vortexing, and then allowing the culture to settle before plating on solid medium is standard procedure for mycobacterium.32Colonies from each sample were grown on at least two plates of solid medium for 7 10 days. Colonies were counted for each time point and the CFUml calculated. Preliminary experiments con rmed by microscopy that disaggregation of cultures was achieved using the syringe needle, and initial experiments determined that the addition of the SDS to the NG and LSMMG cultures only during thedisaggregation and dilution stage did not alter colony forming ability (data not shown). To determine statistical differences between LSMMG and NG cultures during the 37 70 h time period of growth, regression analysis was performed on the OD 600data using SAS 9.4 (SAS). Size of bacterium A portion of the LHM4 culture grown for 4 days in a 10 ml HARV waspassed through a 27.5 gauge needle and xed by the addition of 30 l4  paraformaldehyde to 10 l of culture. Samples were placed at 4 C for at least 24 h before the measurement of the diameter and length of 50 bacteria using microscopy. The Instat3 program and the Unpaired T-test orEffect of LSMMG on M. marinum CF Abshire et al 12 npj Microgravity (2016) 16038 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAthe Mann Whitney test was used to compare the lengths and diameters of the bacterium. RNA preparation RNA extraction from M. marinum strain 1218R was performed according to Rustad et al.68RNA integrity (Supplementary Table 1) was assessed on an A g i l e n t2 1 0 0B i o a n a l y z e r( A g i l e n t ,S a n t a Clara, CA, USA) and quantitated using the Qubit RNA BR assay (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA-Seq analyses RNA samples were subjected to DNase treatment, puri cation with the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and removal ofthe rRNA and preparation of the RNA-Seq libraries using the ScriptSeqComplete kit for bacteria (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA).The DNA libraries (4 nmoll) were pooled, denatured with 0.2 moll sodiumhydroxide, and diluted to 12 pmoll. A 76-cycle paired-end read sequen-cing run was performed on an Illumina Miseq desktop sequencer (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, USA). The number of sequence reads is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Seventy- ve base-paired-end RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the M. marinum strain M genome (Genbank accession number CP000854) using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) aligner. Readswere visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, BroadInstitute, http:www.broadinstitute.orgigvhome). Reads were aligned tothe M. marinum strain M transcriptome using RSEM version 1.2.9 for transcript quanti cation. The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) was calculated for each gene and sample gene level differential expression analysis was performed using EBseqversion 1.1.5 within RSEM. For the short or long exposure times, theLSMMG samples were compared with NG samples. The LSMMG samplesfrom the two exposure times (short and long) were also compared.Changes in expression were signi cant if Po0.05. The functions of genes were assigned according to the Marinolist (http:mycobrowser.ep .ch marinolist.html). Pathway assignment used the Marinolist advanced search and the literature, and M. marinum orthologs of M. tuberculosis genes were identi ed using http:tuberculist.ep .ch. Transcript levels for the genes assigned to pathways were analyzed and heat maps generated usingGeneSifter (http:www.geospiza.comProductsAnalysisEdition.shtml).RNA-Seq data has been deposited in the GeneLab database. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR RNA samples were treated with DNase and converted to cDNA usingMoloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase. qPCR reactions induplicate were performed with primers (Supplementary Table 8) andPower SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,USA) using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer s recommendations. The cDNA level for transcripts was normalized to the cDNA level for 16s rRNA for each sample.This ratio was averaged for the three independent samples and the foldchange in expression was calculated by dividing the LSMMG average bythe NG average. Survival studies LHM4 were removed from the HARV and the OD 600measured in a sample after disaggregation. Bacteria were in exponential phase (OD 6000.090.2). For radiation and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) studies, bacteria were centrifuged and washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2Tween 80 (Tw-PBS), before resuspension at OD 600 0.2 in Tw-PBS. Two samples (200 l in a sealed tube) were prepared for each time point or dose. One sample was treated (1 4 h) with 5 mmoll H 2O2at 30 C or with gamma radiation (100 400 Gy) at room temperature. The second sample was not treated and was used as the control to determine the CFUml atzero treatment at the time point. A similar method was used to treat thebacteria with acid. The bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended atOD 600 0.2 in growth medium (control) or growth medium at pH 3.5. A small amount of one mole per liter citric acid was added to the medium to reach pH 3.5. Once the bacteria were resuspended, the pH was checked using pH paper. The control and acid-treated samples were incubated at30 C for 1 4 h. After all treatment regimens, bacteria were disaggregated and diluted as described above and grown on three plates containing solidmedium. Bacteria were incubated at 30 C for 7 10 days and the CFUmlcalculated for each control and treated sample. Survival was calculated by: Survival  AvgCFU ml of treated culture AvgCFU ml of control culture100 The survival data were compared by calculating the area under the curve for each data set using the Trapezoidal Rule, and the Student sT-test was used to compare the values. These statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Ms Paula Polk in the Genomic Core at LSUHSC for performing the preparation and sequencing of RNA-Seq samples.
