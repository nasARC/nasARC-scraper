Because rodent models for space ight missions have provided critical data in support of human space exploration, great efforts have been committed to continue the rodent ight payloads beyond the Space Shuttle era. When using the shuttle as the vehicle, the ight duration for AEM was expected to be o20 days. Now new ight payload scenarios have been developed which will require the AEM to be used with minimal modi cation to continue the rodent ight for 30 days with an additional margin of 5 days for ight preparation for other types of ight vehicles (e.g., Russian Bion-M free yer). Potential operational limiting factors for the AEM, which could theoretically bar use for longer duration ights, have been outlined in previous publications11,12and include the waste handling system, odor containing capability, and food and water supplies within the unit. With NASA s growing push for longer duration crewed ights, there is also an increased importance placed on long-term studies of model organisms as a pre- requisite, despite existing outside the scope of the hardware originally designed for short duration travel. Therefore, a study ofthe durability of the hardware beyond the original design for short term Space Shuttle ights is required before application on the International Space Station and is the basis for this research, whilealso determining if other potential limiting factors exist when food and water can be replenished. Follow-up studies designed to test the AEM hardware life support functionality and durability are stillneeded beyond 35 days because these were outside of the scope of this initial investigation into the proof of concept as outlined by NASA headquarters science requirements (unpublished). On the basis of the food and water data from previous ight and ground studies (unpublished), the nutrient-upgraded rodent food bar (NuRFB) and water content in the unit is enough for 12 mice to reach the 35 day duration. Therefore, this study was designed totest whether the AEM, with minimal modi cations, could be used for up to 35 days to support mice growth with a focus on the water handling system. Because external replenishment of NuRFBand water is easily administered to the AEM, it is outside of thecurrent AEM hardware requirements to contain enough for a 35- day study with ve rats, so we instead investigated whether the waste handling, air circulation, and lighting, and other hardwaresystems could support ve rats for 35 days if the AEM were supplemented with the required food and water to determine which, if any, life support system existed as a limiting factor for use of the AEM for up to 35 days. These studies exist as important ground based controls in order to demonstrate the absence of a cage effect due to the AEM when compared with vivarium-housed animals and to establish an 1Space Biosciences Research Branch, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA;2Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, Seattle, Washington, USA;3Wyle, NASA Research Park, Moffett Field, CA, USA and4ASRC Federal Space and Defense, Beltsville, MD, USA.

RESULTS Mouse studyThe body mass measurements (Figure 1) were similar between the vivarium and AEM groups at both time-points during thetests. The average initial (day 0) animal body masses for vivariumand AEM groups were 19.0  0.5 g and 19.0  0.5 g respectively.At day 35, the average animal body weights for vivarium andAEM groups were 22.3  1.2 g ( n 36) and 22.4  0.8 g ( n 36), respectively. The NuRFB consumption among the vivarium controls and AEM-caged animals were similar (Figure 2). There was nosigni cant difference between the average NuRFB consumption for mice in vivarium (3.55  0.06 g per mouse per day) and AEM(3.69  0.15 g per mouse per day). The average water consumptionfor mice in the vivarium (2.2  0.4 ml per animal per day)was lower than the average water consumption in the AEMs(4.2  0.1 ml per animal per day) by over 90 (Figure 3). CO 2concentration in the AEMs was o0.1 throughout the test which is well under the acceptable limit (NASA Internal Document6341 from 11 August 2013: Rodent Research Science Require- ments Envelope Document) of 0.7 and ammonia (NH 3) concentration was detectable only towards the end of the testato2 p.p.m. for most readings. On a single occasion, the NH 3 level in one of the AEM was measured as 8 p.p.m., but these readings were also well within the acceptable limit of 25 p.p.m.Thelters contained all animal waste throughout the test withoutany break in containment. All fans functioned normally through- out the test. The pressure gradient across the exhaust lter was measured throughout the experiment to provide an indication of air ow across the lter. Initial pressure gradient for all three AEMs was between 0.33 and 0.35 inches of water, and the pressure changedby no more than 0.02 inches of water over the duration of the test.This indicates that no signi cant air ow restriction developed due to occlusion of the lters by animal waste or food. Notably, on test day 20 of the AEM Test, NuRFB mounted on the food plates in onecage began detaching from the food plates, but the air ow across thelter did not change. Rat study The rat body mass measurements are shown in Figure 1. There were no statistical differences between the AEM and vivariumgroups at the beginning (day 0), interim (day 21), or in the end(day 35) of the study. The average body weights ( n 15) for rats in vivarium and AEM at day 0 were 275.8  11.4 g and 274.2  11.3 g,respectively, 384.0  34.4 g and 386.0  28.6 g, respectively, at day21, and 425.6  41.7 g and 437.6  32.8 g, respectively, at day 35. The average daily food consumption is shown alongside the data of that of the mice in Figure 2 and we observed that the AEMvalues (32.0  0.8 g per rat per day) were higher than the averagefood consumption in the vivarium cage (25.2  0.3 g per ratper day) groups. A trend similar to the one observed in miceaverage water consumption is shown in Figure 3, where thisparameter was also elevated in the AEMs (45.0  1.7 ml per rat per day) compared with the vivarium control (25.2  0.3 ml per rat per day). Immediately prior to euthanasia, blood samples were collected for a standard panel of clinical chemistry tests includingquanti cation of blood glucose, albumin, aspartate aminotransfer- ase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine total protein. AEM and vivarium control group values were within the referencerange or within 10 of the vivarium controls. Also, there was nosigni cant difference in organ mass per gram total body mass of the thymus, adrenals, spleen, heart, or lungs between the AEMgroup and the vivarium controls (Figure 4). No mortalities or noticeable health problems occurred during the study. In the present study, gross morphological evaluations of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestines showed no signsof discoloration or gastric lesions suggestive of digestive problemsor allergies during the study. In addition, CO 2concentration in the AEMs was o0.07 throughout the test (well within the acceptable limit of 0.7) and ammonia (NH 3) concentration was undetectable throughout the test (well below the acceptable limit of 25 p.p.m.).

Odors were barely detectable upon opening ofthe AEMs as determined by a group of untrained personnel who were asked to indicate the presenceabsence, and acceptable range of any odor at day 21 when the food was replenished or atday 35 at the conclusion of the study. Again, all fans functioned normally throughout the test. Interior pressure dropped only slightly over the course of the test but the air ow did not appear to be impaired. Initial readings were between 0.32 inches of water and 0.34 inches of water for all AEMs, at day 21 the readings dropped by 0.02 inches of water in each AEM, and nal readings at day 35 were between 0.25 inches of water and 0.28 inches of water. DISCUSSION Several organs were observed to have slight changes in mass, and the following discussion speculates on these potential variations. Although no further tests were conducted to validate thesespeculations, they are offered as areas of potential further study and as cautions to researchers which may utilize the AEM hardware in space ight experiments to study a particular organ system. The AEM unit induced a decreased organ mass (normalized to baseline and total body mass) in both kidneys ( 4.8) and adrenals of mice ( 21.1; Figure 4) after 35 days of habitation in the AEM. Enlargement of the kidneys is commonly associatedclinically with increased water retention as a result of an obstruction of urine ow, such as by kidney stones. Speculatively, the observed decrease in kidney size could be a result of theobserved increase in water consumption that eliminated blockages in the kidneys in the AEM mice, which consumed more water. The observed decrease in mouse adrenal mass canpotentially be explained by a decrease in stress in the AEM cagesthat results in a decrease in cortisol production, a major function of the adrenals. Conversely, there was an observed increase in normalized mass of the mouse thymus (28.8) and spleen (27.6) as a result ofhabitation for 35 days in the AEM. Thymic involution, or theshrinking of the thymus with age, is consistent in almost all vertebrates, 13and was again observed in our study, although the shrinkage in relation to baseline size was diminished in AEM mice(29.7 in vivarium versus 9.4 in AEM). Involution could have a major impact on the immune system s ability to mount a strong response to new threats due to the decreased ability to producenaive T-cells. Thus, the AEM cage, which evidently prevents some degree of thymic involution, may be a bene t to the inhabitant s immune system. This effect was lost with the rats, which althoughthey showed the same trend as the mice, they were not statistically signi cant. Reported literature claims that enlarged thymus in humans shows negligible occurrences of signi cant thymic disease, 14so the mitigated thymic shrinkage when compared with vivarium controls after the 35 day stay in the AEM unit potentially demonstrates no signi cant impact on thymic health. Analysis of the mouse blood (Table 1), however, indicates that all analytes studied exist within the normal ranges within theTable 1.

Further blood analysis also illustrated several statistically signi cant, but too slight to be considered biologically relevant, differences in the AEM group such as a 6.8 elevation inhematocrit (HCT), which could be a sign of minor dehydration oreven slight chronic hypoxia, a 5.2 increase in mean corpuscularvolume (MCV) commonly indicative of a slight vitamin B12 andorfolic acid de ciency, and a 2.2 decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and 7.8 decrease in its concentration(MCHC), which both could be indicative of minor iron de ciency.Mouse blood analysis also showed statistically signi cant differences in the AEM compared to the vivarium animals forseveral parameters such as a 38.7 increase in cholesterol, which may be stress induced, a 16 decrease in alkaline phosphatase which may illustrate malnutrition or vitamin B12 de ciency, an 18.1 decrease in bicarbonate which could be a sign of increaseduid loss, and a 6.4 decrease in albumin to globulin ratio which may be indicative of a slight kidney disorder which removes more albumin than in the vivarium animals.

Further analysis is required to con rm or refute given causes and potential diagnoses above based on blood and organ results,and they are provided merely as a suggested explanationfor future studies and to prepare researchers utilizing the AEMhardware on space ight projects for potential limitations in studies which focus on these organ systems. The reported values were within the normal physiological range reported for rats, 15so we conclude that although the AEM cage seemed to causevariations in several parameters, these uctuations are not biologically signi cant and support the proof of concept for 35-day habitation in the AEM on a diet of the NuRFB, providing abasis for expanding the AEM hardware originally designed for short duration space Space Shuttle into 35-day missions aboard the International Space Station and other space ight vehicles. The nutritional adequacy of the NuRFB for short-term (18to 20 day) rodent space ight and ground-based space ight simulation experiments has been veri ed. 16However, the nutritional adequacy of the NuRFB for use in longer space ight and on-ground studies has not been evaluated. The results obtained from the mouse study have demonstrated for the rst time that the AEM with its current con gurations can be used to house up to 12 female C57BL6 mice for up to 35 daysof extended operations without any observable system failures. In addition, data obtained from the rat study have demonstrated that AEM can provide proper life supports for up to 5 adultSprague Dawley male rats for 35 days if the food is replenished as needed throughout the experiment duration. This researchprovides NASA with an essential lessoned learned, namely thatthe limiting factor to 35 day housing of rats and mice within the AEM will be successful replenishment to food and water, as supported by the absence of any hardware failures in life supportsystems and the blood and organ analysis of subjects which fellwithin the normal ranges of animals not exposed to AEM cages.This opens the doors to similar ground based and ight missions of longer duration of up to 90 days, the desired range of the next generation of NASA long-term rodent studies aboard the International Space Station. MATERIALS AND METHODS AEM hardware Three ground government support equipment AEM units (Figure 5) were used for the feeding studies of rats and mice. AEM units were built according to ight con gurations which, for mouse studies, delineates thateach AEM is loaded with two water bags in the water box container with approximately 2 liters of heat-sterilized distilled water per bag. Water consumption was derived as a difference in the water bag mass before and after the test. Each AEM cage was tted with a cage divider that provided two separate and equal compartments for mice. In each half of the AEM cage, two food plates were provided with one attached to the water box side, and one attached to the cage side. For the rat study, water was provided with two external graduated cylinders connected with plastictubes through the water box to lixits. Control animals were handled and provided the same environment and provisions as ight con guration. Water consumption was recorded daily and fresh heat-sterilized water was added as needed. No divider was used in the cage for the rat study due to the size of the animals, therefore only ve rats were housed in each AEM. Each AEM was instrumented with humidity (Vernier Software and Technology Type RH-BTA) and temperature probes (Vernier Software andTechnology Type TMP-BHA) and a gas port for periodic sampling for ammonia (NH 3) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). NH 3and CO 2were measured using appropriate Draeger tubes and calibrated SKC Personal Sampling Pumps (model 222). Pressure drops across the exhaust lter were also measured at the gas port using an inclined Dwyer manometer accurate to 0.1 inches of water. The temperature and room humidity data were logged using LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) software running ontwo laptop computers. The sensor to laptop connections used Vernier Software and Technology SensorDAQ (Vernier Software  Technology, Beaverton, OR, USA) interfaces. During the test period, the AEMs were placed on vertical stands and covered with shrouds at all times except for daily health checks and any lighting was provided by the internal AEM light xtures. Diets The NASA Type 12 NuRFB, the of cial approved rodent ight diet, were used for the reported studies and a detailed description of the NASA NuRFB has previously been reported.1719Diet requirements for the 35-day study were estimated based on the AEM ight payload preparation formula, which states that the average daily NuRFB and water consump- tion requirement are 4.0 g and 4.5 ml, respectively, per mouse per day, and 40 g and 50 ml per rat per day. In the shuttle ight payload operations, an additional 20 mass of NuRFB and water were loaded as waste allowancefor both the mice and rats. In the mouse study, each AEM cage was tted with a cage divider, providing two separate areas for the mice. In each half of the AEM cage,two food plates were provided: one attached to the water box and the other to the cage side. Each water box diet plate accommodated four pieces of NuRFB, and each cage diet plate accommodated ve pieces of NuRFB, for a total of 9  Type 12 M NuRFB (20.32 cm  2.54 cm  3.05 cm) per half cage, or  2.24 kg per half cage (4.48 kg per AEM). In the rat study no cage divider was utilized in the AEM and the remaining NuRFB on the food plates were replaced with new food plates on day 21. Animal study All procedures used in this study conformed to the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals20and Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.21The animal protocols for mouse and rat studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center prior to the experiments. For the mouse study, female C57BL6 mice (35 days old) were acquired from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA) 4 weeks prior to the start of the test. Female C57BL6 mice (body mass 15.2  0.8 g) were used in this study because they are a strain commonly used in the NASA ight experiments.210For the rat portion of the study, male Sprague Dawley rats aged 12 weeks (body weight 159  8.6 g) were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA). Young male Sprague Dawley rats were used in the study because many space ight and ground-based space ight simulation studies have been conducted using young male rats and they are the strain likely to be used in future NASA rat ight experiments. At the NASA Ames Research Center Animal Care Facility, animals were housed in standard polypropylene shoebox -style cages in a room maintained at a temperature of 24  1 C, relative humidity of 40 70 and lighting which allows for a 12 h lightdark cycle. The control animal lighting cycle in the vivarium cages was synchronized with the AEMhardware operations. Upon receipt, the animals were randomly assigned to groupings of six mice or ve rats, housed in vivarium cages with microisolator tops, and Figure 5. Schematic outlining the Animal Enclosure Module key features.Evaluation of rodent space ight hardware EL Moyer et al 5  2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited npj Microgravity (2016) 16002provided distilled water via standard water bottles and sipper tubes. The animals were continued on the same food diet as at the vendor s facility. After 3 days of acclimation, the animals were implanted subcutaneouslywith microchips (Biomedic Data Systems IMITM 1000, Biomedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE, USA) under anesthesia for identi cation purposes, a standard practice in AEM ight payload operations. Then, animals were provided distilled water via water bottles with stoppers tted with AEM-like lixits that were refurbished prior to the test. The diet wastransitioned slowly from the standard rodent diet over the course of 5 daysuntil the animal diet consisted entirely of the NuRFB, at which point allanimals were fed with only NuRFB until the end of the study. Water was provided ad libitum throughout the entire study duration. Diets were provided ad libitum throughout the entire study duration but removed overnight before the end of day 35 due to blood draw taken at time oftissue collection. In the mouse study, following a 10-day acclimation, female C57BL6 mice at 9 weeks old were randomly assigned ( n 36 per group) to AEM units or vivarium cages. There were no signi cant differences in the initial body masses of mice in vivarium (19.0  0.5 g) or AEM cages (19.0  0.5 g). In the rat study, following a 10-day acclimation, male Sprague Dawley rats age 13 14 weeks old were randomly assigned ( n 15 per group) to AEM units or vivarium cages with 5 rats per cage. There were no signi cant differences in the initial body weights of rats in vivarium (275.8  11.4 g) orAEM cages (274.2  11.3 g). The cages remained untouched during thecourse of the study, except for on day 21 when the AEM were opened, theNuRFB plates were removed and weighed, new NuRFB plates were added, and the animals were given a general health check-up by an on-site veterinarian while body mass measurements were recorded. Animal water consumption was measured daily for the rats, while animal body mass and food intake were measured at day 21 and at the end of thestudy (day 35). CO 2and NH 3measurements were recorded on test days 1, 16, 28, and 35. NASA Animal Care Facility staff and Science team personnelperformed a daily visual animal health evaluation. The attending veterinarian performed a detailed individual animal check and health evaluation on all of the animals at animal receiving, animal load at teststart (day 0), during NuRFB replenishment (day 21), and animal unload attest end (day 35). Organ mass measurements and serum clinical chemistry One day before the end of the study (day 34), the animals were fasted overnight and then on day 35 the animals were anesthetized with isourane, blood was collected via cardiac puncture, and then the subjects were euthanized via iso urane overdose paired with decapitation (rats) or cervical dislocation (mice). The kidneys, lungs, spleen, thymus, adrenals,and heart were dissected and mass measurements were recorded foreach organ. For clinical chemistry measurements, blood was collected in vacutainer tubes and serum was obtained by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 10 min at 4 C. Serum samples were stored on ice and shipped to IDEXX VeterinaryServices, Inc (West Sacramento, CA, USA). Serum triglycerides, cholesterol,fasting glucose, globulin, creatine kinase, and bicarbonates were measuredby colorimetric enzyme assays using an automated Clinical ChemistryAnalyzer (Olympus AU 400, Olympus America Inc, Center Valley, PA, USA).Colorimetric enzyme assays were also used to measure serum biomarkersof liver function of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and direct and total bilirubin. Biomarkers of renal function included the measurement of albumin, creatinine, totalprotein, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, and electrolytes(potassium, sodium, and chloride) also by colorimetric assays using theClinical Chemistry Analyzer. A Hematology Analyzer (Bayer Advia 120, Global Medical Instruments, Ramsey, MN, USA) was also used to determine red blood cell count, mean red blood cell volume, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemo- globin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count,percent lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, baso-phils, hematocrit, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin, andbrinogen. Statistical analysis Animal body mass measurements, food consumption, water consumption, and organ mass data normalized to total body mass following euthanasiawere analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with JMP 7.0 software(JMP, Cary, NC, USA). For all tests, Po0.05 was considered signi cant. Values in all gures are expressed as mean  s.d. unless speci ed.
