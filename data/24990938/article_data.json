In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, obob mice fed ad libitum (obob ), and obob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed obob ). Mice were maintained at 32C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. obob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptIntroduction Leptin, a polypeptide hormone secreted by adipocytes, is best known for its role in the regulation of appetite and energy metabolism (Mistry, et al. 1997; Myers 2004). Rodents deficient in leptin signaling, due to either an inability to generate leptin ( obob mice) or the signaling form of the leptin receptor ( dbdb mice and fafa rats), become morbidly obese (Clement 2000). Their excess weight is the result of a combination of hyperphagia and reduced thermogenesis (Hwa, et al. 1996). In addition to morbid obesity, leptin deficiency is associated with hypogonadism (Barkan, et al. 2005), elevated corticosteroid levels (Saito and Bray 1983), and impaired thermoregulation (Trayhurn and James 1978). Leptin-deficient mice and leptin receptor-deficient mice and rats have reduced overall bone mass, reduced longitudinal bone growth (Kishida, et al. 2005; Steppan, et al. 2000), and decreased bone formation (Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008). In addition, impaired bone resorption in obob and dbdb mice results in mild osteopetrosis (Turner, et al. 2013), a condition which may contribute to the reported reductions in bone quality observed in these animals (Ealey, et al. 2006; Kimura, et al. 2012). Impaired bone resorption may also account for the age- and bone-dependent variation in cancellous bone volume observed in leptin signaling-deficient mice; the mutant mice are reported to have normal to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra and decreased to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in long bones (Hamrick, et al. 2004; Iwaniec, et al. 2007; Williams, et al. 2011). The skeletal abnormalities observed in mice and rats with defective leptin signaling suggest that leptin plays a role in normal skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover (Bartell, et al. 2011; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Kishida et al. 2005; Steppan et al. 2000; Turner et al. 2013). However, it is not clear to what extent the skeletal phenotype of obob mice is impacted by additional factors associated with morbid obesity. Although rare in humans, leptin signaling deficiency occurs as a result of loss of function mutations in the genes for leptin and the leptin receptor (Friedman and Halaas 1998). More common causes for low leptin signaling in humans include anorexia and starvation (Dardeno, et al. 2010; Muller, et al. 2009). At the other end of the spectrum, diet-induced leptin resistance, associated with chronically elevated leptin levels, mimics many of the metabolic consequences of leptin deficiency on energy metabolism and is thought to contribute to development of morbid obesity (Jung and Kim 2013). Thus, changes in leptin levels andor leptin sensitivity could have physiological effects on bone metabolism. In order to better understand the specific actions of leptin in regulating bone mass, density and architecture, we performed a study in which differences in body weight gain between rapidly growing wild type (WT) and obob mice were prevented by housing all mice at thermoneutral temperature (32C) to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure (Trayhurn 1979) and pair-feeding the mutant mice to WT mice to equalize food intake.Turner et al.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptMaterials and Methods Experimental Design The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Four-week-old female obob (n20) and homozygous WT ( ) littermate (n11) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). At 6 weeks of age, all animals were transferred from normal room temperature (22C) to thermoneutral temperature (32C) and maintained at thermoneutrality on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle for the duration of study (12 weeks). Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Labratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to WT mice (n11) and a group of obob mice (n10). A second group of obob mice (n10) was pair-fed to the WT mice; the obob mice were fed an amount of food equivalent to the group mean for WT mice. Food consumption was measured daily in WT mice and weekly in the ad libitum -fed obob mice. Body weight was recorded weekly in all mice. The fluorochrome declomycin (20 mgkg, Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered at study initiation and the fluorochrome calcein (20 mgkg, Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice to label mineralizing bone. All mice were fasted overnight. The mice were then anesthetized with 23 isofluorane delivered in oxygen, bled by cardiac puncture, and glucose measured using a glucometer (Life Scan Inc, Milpitas, CA). Serum was collected and stored at 80C for measurement of global markers of bone turnover. Uteri and abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) were excised and weighed. Femora and lumbar vertebrae were removed and stored in 70 ethanol for analysis using dual energy absorptiometry (DXA), microcomputed tomography (CT), and histomorphometry. Tibiae were removed, cleaned of soft tissue, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80C for mRNA isolation and gene expression analysis. Serum Chemistry Serum osteocalcin was measured using mouse Gla-osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA kit from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Serum CTx was measured using mouse CTx ELISA kit from Life Sciences Advanced Technologies (Saint Petersburg, FL). Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Femoral bone mineral content (BMC, mg), area (cm2), and bone mineral density (BMD, gcm2) were determined ex vivo using DXA (Piximus, Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA). Microcomputed Tomography CT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of bone microarchitecture (Bouxsein, et al. 2010). Femora and lumbar vertebrae were scanned in 70 ethanol using a Scanco CT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12  12  12 m (55 kV p x-ray voltage, 145 A intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Evaluations were conducted with filtering parameters sigma and support set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Bone segmentation was performed at a threshold of 245 (scale, 01000) determined empirically. Total femur was evaluated followed by evaluation of cortical boneTurner et al. Page 3 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptin the midshaft femur and cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis. Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from non-bone. Following, all cortical slices were examined visually for potential inclusion of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex (extremely rare at this site) and manually removed when present. For cortical bone, 20 slices (0.24 mm) of bone were evaluated, and cross-sectional tissue volume (cortical and marrow volume, mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (m) measured. Polar moment of inertia was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Architectural parameters are expressed using standard 3-dimensional nomenclature. For the femoral metaphysis, 40 slices (480 m) of cancellous bone were evaluated. The entire cancellous compartment was assessed in the femoral epiphysis. Analysis of lumbar vertebra included the entire region of cancellous bone between the cranial and caudal growth plates. Manual contouring was used to delineate cancellous from cortical bone in the femur metaphysis, femur epiphysis, and vertebral body. Cancellous bone measurements in femur and lumbar vertebra included bone volume fraction (bone volumetissue volume, BVTV, ), connectivity density (mm3), trabecular number (mm1), trabecular thickness (mm) and trabecular separation (mm) (Thomsen, et al. 2005). Histomorphometry The histological methods used here have been described in detail (Iwaniec, et al. 2008). In brief, the distal femur was dehydrated in graded series of ethanol and xylene and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate. Sections (4 m thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (LeicaJung 2165) and affixed to slides precoated with a 1 gelatin solution. Sections were mounted unstained for measurement of fluorochrome labels. For cell-based measurements, sections were stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.251.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. The entire cancellous compartment was evaluated in the distal femoral epiphysis and body of lumbar vertebra. Fluorochrome-based measurements of bone formation included: (1) mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeterbone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, ), (2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day interlabel interval, mday), and (3) bone formation rate (bone formation ratebone perimeter: calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, m2my). Declomycin label retained in the regions of interest (mm labelmm2 tissue area) in the distal femur epiphysis and lumbar vertebra was measured as a dynamic index of bone resorption in obob and pair-fed obob mice. This method is based on the principle that declomycin label was incorporated into bone at equivalent rates in both groups of obob mice when the fluorochrome was administered prior to treatment initiation and differences measured at study termination reflect the effect of treatment on resorption of the fluorochrome-labeled bone. This method has been described (Westerlind, et al. 1997). We did not measureTurner et al. Page 4 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptdeclomycin label in WT mice because almost no label was retained in this group at termination of study. Cell-based measurements included osteoblast perimeter, osteoclast perimeter, adipocyte number, and adipocyte area. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by a palisade of plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to the thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with the bone perimeter (osteoblast perimeterbone perimeter, ). Osteoclast perimeter was determined as the percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated (two or more nuclei) cells with acid phosphatase positive (red-stained) cytoplasm (osteoclast perimeterbone perimeter, ). Cartilage area in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis was measured and expressed as  cancellous bone area. The intense metachromatic (purple) staining of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans with toluidine blue was used to identify cartilage within trabeculae. Adipocyte number and area were also measured and expressed as bone marrow adiposity (tissue area occupied by adipocytes: adipocyte areatissue area, ), and adipocyte density (number of adipocytesmm2). Adipocytes were identified morphologically as large ( 75 m2) circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane and lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. This method was previously validated by fat extraction and analysis (Menagh, et al. 2010). All histomorphometric data are expressed using standard 2-dimensional nomenclature (Dempster, et al. 2013) to distinguish 2-dimensional histomorphometric measurements from 3-dimensional CT measurements. Gene Expression Tibiae were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and then further homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen; Valencia, CA). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturers protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). The expression of 84 genes related to osteogenic differentiation was determined using the Mouse Osteogenesis RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen; Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH and relative quantification was determined using the Ct method using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen). Statistics Mean responses of individual variables were compared between the WT, obob , and pair-fed obob groups using separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Tukeys procedure for pairwise multiple comparisons. The required conditions for valid use of ANOVA models were assessed using Levenes test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. A modified F test was used when the assumption of equal variance was violated, with Welchs two-sample t-test used for pairwise comparisons (Welch 1951). The Kruskal- Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons. Longitudinal data on body weight were analyzed using a random intercept linear mixedTurner et al. Page 5 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptmodel that allowed distinct linear rates of change for the WT and pair-fed obob groups and a quadratic time trend for the obob group. The Hommel method for maintaining the family- wise error rate at 5 was used to adjust for multiple comparisons (Hommel 1988). Data analysis was performed using R version 2.12. Gene expression analysis was performed using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis version 3.5 (Qiagen). Gene expression is reported as mean fold change. All other data are reported as mean  SE. Results The effects of pair feeding (to match food intake in WT mice) on body weight and cumulative food intake, and on abdominal WAT weight, blood glucose levels, uterine weight, and serum osteocalcin and CTx levels at sacrifice in leptin-deficient obob mice housed at thermoneutral temperature are shown in Figure 1. Six-week-old obob mice were heavier than their age-matched WT littermates at start of treatment and gained more weight than the WT mice during the 12-week study (Figures 1A and B). obob mice were hyperphagic consuming, on average, twice as much food as WT mice (Figure 1C). At termination of study, the obob mice had more abdominal WAT (Figure 1D), and were hyperglycemic (Figure 1E) and hypogonadal (Figure 1F) compared to WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had lower body weight and body weight gain, lower cumulative food intake, lower abdominal WAT weight, lower blood glucose levels, and slightly lower uterine weight than obob mice. Pair-feeding abolished differences in weight gain and blood glucose levels between WT and obob mice. However, the pair-fed obob mice were still heavier, had more WAT, and were hypogonadal compared to WT mice. Effects of pair feeding on serum markers of bone turnover in obob mice Serum levels of osteocalcin (Figure 1G) and CTx (Figure 1H) were lower in obob mice than in WT mice. Also, pair-fed obob mice had lower serum osteocalcin levels than either WT or obob mice. Insufficient serum was available for measurement of CTx in pair-fed obob mice. Effects of pair feeding on bone mass and architecture in obob mice The effects of pair feeding on femur BMC, area and BMD, and on femur length, bone volume, and cortical and cancellous bone architecture in obob mice are shown in Table 1. obob mice had lower femur BMC, bone area, and BMD than WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had lower BMC and bone area than WT or obob mice. Significant differences in BMD were not detected between obob and pair-fed obob mice. Femur length and bone volume obob mice had shorter femurs and lower femoral bone volume than WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had lower femur length and lower total femur bone volume than WT or obob mice. Cortical bone in midshaft femur obob mice had lower cortical bone volume and cortical thickness than WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had lower midshaft femur cortical bone volume and cortical thickness, and greater marrow volume than WT or obob mice.Turner et al. Page 6 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptSignificant differences in cross-sectional volume and polar moment of inertia were not detected among groups. Cancellous bone in distal femur metaphysis obob mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, and trabecular number, and lower trabecular separation than WT mice. Differences in trabecular thickness were not detected between the two groups. Pair-fed obob mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular number, and lower trabecular separation than WT mice or obob mice, and higher connectivity density than WT mice. Trabecular thickness in pair-fed obob mice was higher than in obob mice but did not differ from WT mice. Cancellous bone in distal femur epiphysis obob mice and pair-fed obob mice had higher bone volume fraction, connectivity density, and trabecular number, and lower trabecular thickness and separation than WT mice. Differences between obob mice and pair-fed obob mice were not detected for any epiphyseal endpoint measured. The effects of pair feeding on cancellous bone mass and architecture in lumbar vertebra in obob mice are shown in Table 1. obob mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, and trabecular number, and lower trabecular separation than WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had higher bone volume fraction than WT mice and a tendency (p  0.1) for higher bone volume fraction than obob mice. Also, pair-fed obob mice had higher trabecular thickness than WT or obob mice. Connectivity density was lower in pair-fed obob mice than in obob mice but did not differ from WT mice. Trabecular number was higher and trabecular separation was lower in pair-fed obob mice than WT mice. Differences in trabecular number and separation were not detected between obob mice and pair-fed obob mice. Effects of pair feeding on bone histomorphometry in obob mice Cancellous bone in distal femur metaphysis The effects of pair feeding on dynamic and static cancellous bone histomorphometry and marrow adiposity in the distal femur metaphysis in obob mice are shown in Figure 2. obob mice had lower mineralizing perimeter (Figure 2A), mineral apposition rate (Figure 2B), bone formation rate (Figure 2C), and osteoblast perimeter (Figure 2D) compared to WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had lower mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate, and osteoblast perimeter than WT or obob mice. Differences in osteoclast perimeter (Figure 2E) were not detected with treatment. However, cartilage area (Figure 2F), an index of impaired bone resorption, was higher in both groups of obob mice compared to WT mice. Bone marrow adiposity (Figure 2G) tended (p  0.1) to be greater in obob mice than WT mice and was greater in pair-fed obob mice than in WT or obob mice. Adipocyte density (Figure 2H) was higher in pair-fed obob mice than in obob mice. Representative photomicrographs of marrow adipocytes in the 3 groups of mice are shown in Figure 3AC.

Pair-fed obob mice had lower mineralizing perimeter, bone formation rate, and osteoblast perimeter than WT or obob mice. Osteoclast perimeter (Figure 4E) was higher in obob mice and pair-fed obob mice than WT mice. Retention of declomycin label (Figure 4F), an index of decreased bone resorption, was higher in pair-fed obob mice than in obob mice. obob mice had greater cartilage area (Figure 4G), marrow adiposity (Figure 4H), and adipocyte density (Figure 4I) than WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had higher cartilage area, marrow adiposity, and adipocyte density than WT or obob mice. Representative photomicrographs of cartilage and declomycin label in the 3 groups are shown in Figure 3DF and GI, respectively. Cancellous bone in lumbar vertebra The effects of pair feeding on dynamic and static cancellous bone histomorphometry and on bone marrow adiposity in lumbar vertebra are shown in Figure 5. obob mice had lower mineralizing perimeter (Figure 5A), bone formation rate (Figure 5C), and osteoblast perimeter (Figure 5D) than WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had lower mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate (Figure 5B), bone formation rate, and osteoblast perimeter than WT or obob mice. Significant differences in osteoclast perimeter (Figure 5E) were not detected among the 3 groups. However, retention of declomycin label (Figure 5F) was higher in pair-fed obob mice than in obob mice. obob mice had greater marrow adiposity (Figure 5G) and adipocyte density (Figure 5H) than WT mice. Pair-fed obob mice had higher marrow adiposity and adipocyte density than WT or obob mice. Effects of pair feeding on gene expression in tibia The effects of pair feeding on expression of 84 genes related to osteogenesis in tibia are shown in Figure 6. Compared to WT mice, expression levels of 24 genes were altered in obob mice (7 higher and 17 lower) and 26 genes in pair-fed obob mice (10 higher and 16 lower). The expression levels of 14 genes were altered in common in obob and pair-fed obob mice. Compared to obob mice, expression levels of 11 genes (3 higher and 8 lower) were altered in pair-fed obob mice. obob mice exhibited reductions in several key genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function, including Sp7osterix (2.5 fold), NfB1 (1.2 fold), alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) (1.5 fold), Itgam (CD11b) (1.3 fold) and osteocalcin (Bglap) (1.8 fold). obob mice also exhibited reductions in genes related to cartilage formation and maturation, including col2a1 (1.5 fold) and col10a1 (1.7 fold). Genes whose expression were elevated include Bmpr1a (1.3 fold) and Smad4 (1.3 fold). Compared to WT mice, pair-fed obob mice expressed even lower levels of osteocalcin (3.8 fold) than observed in obob mice and, in addition, had lower mRNA levels for the osteoclast differentiation factor Csf1 (1.5 fold) and osteoblast differentiation factor Runx2 (1.4 fold). Furthermore, compared to WT mice, pair-fed obob mice had higher gene expression levels for the cytokinesgrowth factors TNFa (1.6 fold) and TGFB2 (1.3 fold). Discussion We investigated the contribution of excessive weight gain to the skeletal phenotype of leptin-deficient obob mice. Mice were housed at 32C and a group of obob mice was pair-Turner et al. Page 8 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptfed to WT mice. Housing mice at 32C, which is within the thermoneutral range for WT and obob mice, was expected to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure and pair feeding obob mice to WT mice was expected to equalize energy intake (Knehans and Romsos 1982; Rafael and Herling 2000). The parallel increase in body weight gain in WT mice and obob mice pair-fed to WT mice over the 12-week duration of study demonstrates the efficacy of this approach for preventing development of morbid obesity in leptin- deficient mice. Consistent with earlier studies (Ealey et al. 2006; Hamrick et al. 2004; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2011), obob mice exhibited a mosaic skeletal phenotype associated with decreased bone formation due to reduced osteoblast number and activity, and defective osteoclast function. Femurs from obob mice were smaller and had thinner cortices than those from WT mice. Furthermore, serum osteocalcin levels, mRNA levels for osteocalcin and SP7 (osterix), osteoblast perimeter and dynamic indices of bone formation were lower in obob mice than in WT mice. However, cancellous bone volume fraction in both distal femur and lumbar vertebra was higher in the obob mice. The higher cancellous bone volume fraction was associated with (1) greatly reduced serum CTx levels, (2) reductions in mRNA levels for NFKB, Itgam and Icam1, (3) retention of calcified cartilage, and (4) retention of fluorochrome label administered at study initiation, all indicative of a defect in bone resorption. Osteoclast perimeter was either unaffected (distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra) or increased (distal femur epiphysis), indicating that reduced bone resorption in obob mice was not due to an inability to generate osteoclasts. Taken together, these findings further support our previous observation that obob mice exhibit mild osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis due to a defect in osteoclast function may be responsible for the poor bone quality (Ealey et al. 2006) and defective tooth eruption (Batt 1978, 1992) reported in obob mice. Pair-feeding accentuated many of the abnormalities in bone size, mass, microarchitecture, gene expression, and turnover typically observed in obob mice. Thus, chronic excessive weight gain typically present in obob mice reduces the magnitude of skeletal effects associated with leptin deficiency. We did not adjust CT-derived cortical bone data for body weight differences because the association between body weight and bone size and density in growing mice varies with bone and bone compartment and this association is altered by leptin (Iwaniec, et al. 2009). However, it is clear that the weight gain due to hyperphagia in obob mice was associated with increases in cortical bone accrual but that these gains were not commensurate with the magnitude of body weight gain. The mechanisms for the partial protective effect of morbid obesity on bone in obob mice are likely to be multifactorial. We have previously reported a strong positive correlation between body weight and total femur bone mass in obob mice (Iwaniec et al. 2009). This finding provides strong evidence that the higher total and cortical bone mass in ad libitum - fed compared to pair-fed obob mice are, at least in part, attributable to higher body weight. Although there have been significant recent advances in our understanding of regulation of bone metabolism by mechanotransduction, the molecular mechanism for this positive effect of weight on bone mass is largely unknown. In addition to direct effects of increasedTurner et al. Page 9 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptmechanical loading, changes in levels of hormones andor growth factors may mediate additional effects of increased weight on the skeleton (Robling 2012). We did not measure levels of insulin, glucocorticoids, or norepinephrine, factors known to be dysregulated in obob mice (Dubuc, et al. 1985; Kim and Romsos 1990; Knehans and Romsos 1982; Rafael and Herling 2000) and known to influence bone metabolism. However, housing food-restricted obob mice at thermoneutral temperature has been reported to reduce abnormalities in blood glucose, insulin, glucocorticoids, and norepinephrine turnover. In contrast, ad libitum -fed obob mice were reported to remain hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic (Lindstrom 2007). We confirmed that blood glucose levels in pair-fed obob mice did not differ from WT mice and were much lower than in ad- libitum -fed obob mice. The contribution of excess insulin secretion and other factors associated with morbid obesity to the protective effects of excess body weight (Hickman and McElduff 1990; Ituarte, et al. 1988; Martineau-Doize, et al. 1986; Pun, et al. 1989; Yaturu 2009) on cortical bone microarchitecture in obob mice requires further investigation. Leptin is required for gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion (Donato, et al. 2011). As a consequence, obob mice are severely hypogonadal (Chehab, et al. 2002). The resulting deficiency in sex steroids would be expected to play a role in the pathological skeletal changes associated with leptin deficiency because sex steroids, especially estrogen, contribute to the sexual dimorphism of the female skeleton and regulate bone turnover balance in adults (Rickard, et al. 2008; Turner, et al. 1989; Turner, et al. 1994). Gonadal dysfunction typically results in elevated bone turnover and cancellous osteopenia. The difference between the skeletal responses to gonadal hormone insufficiency resulting from gonadectomy (high turnover) and from leptin-deficiency (low turnover) is perplexing. However, estrogen has a tonic effect on bone resorption and leptin is required for normal osteoclast function. As a consequence, high bone turnover generally associated with estrogen deficiency may be attenuated in obob mice due to impaired osteoclast function. We speculate that the requirement for leptin in normal osteoclast function may serve as a counter regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive bone loss during fasting. We did not measure sex steroid levels but the higher uterine weight in ad libitum -fed obob mice compared to pair-fed obob mice implies that morbid obesity results in a small increase in circulating estrogen. Higher estrogen levels in blood or adipose tissue may contribute to the protective skeletal effects of morbid obesity (Gennari, et al. 2011; Turner 1999; Turner et al. 1994). Aromatase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of androgens to estrogens, is expressed by adipocytes (Gennari et al. 2011). Thus, adipose-derived estrogen is a plausible mechanism contributing to the skeletal differences between pair-fed and ad libitum -fed obob mice. Initially heavier, obob mice pair-fed to WT mice remained heavier than WT mice for the duration of study. We chose to equalize energy availability rather than body weight in the present study because bone accrual in rapidly growing rodents is strongly associated with energy availability and bone loss accompanies weight loss in adults (Devlin, et al. 2010; Turner and Iwaniec 2011). Low leptin levels induced by caloric restriction are associated with diminished bone mass accrual whereas partial leptin signaling deficiency induced in adTurner et al. Page 10 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptlib-fed mice by treatment with a leptin antagonist increased body weight and bone mass accrual (Solomon, et al. 2014). However, administration of leptin increases bone formation in adult obob mice in spite of weight loss (Bartell et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2013). Thus, both adequate energy availability and leptin play important roles in bone accrual in growing mice. In contrast to peripheral fat depots, which act as dynamic energy reservoirs to maintain circulating triglyceride and free fatty acid levels during feeding and fasting, marrow fat increases with severe weight loss as well as weight gain (Bredella, et al. 2011; Devlin 2011). It is therefore unlikely that the bone marrow fat depot serves as an important energy reservoir for peripheral tissues. There is, however, evidence that bone marrow adipocytes function as negative regulators of hematopoietic lineage cell differentiation (Dorshkind, et al. 2009; Gimble, et al. 1996; Naveiras, et al. 2009). Bone marrow fat is increased in obob mice and this increase is reversed by leptin treatment (Bartell et al. 2011; Hamrick, et al. 2005; Hamrick et al. 2004). Leptin stimulates hematopoiesis (Fantuzzi and Faggioni 2000; Trottier, et al. 2012), an action that may be due to inhibition of bone marrow adipogenesis, increased lipolysis, and direct stimulatory actions on hematopoietic cells. Adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from the same bone marrow mesenchymal precursor and a reciprocal association between osteoblast number and adipocyte number has often been noted, giving rise to the hypothesis that bone marrow adipocytes may either antagonize osteoblast production or, alternatively, generation of adipocytes precludes generation of osteoblasts (Akune, et al. 2004). Other studies suggest that adipocyte and osteoblast number in bone marrow can be independently regulated (Iwaniec and Turner 2013; Menagh et al. 2010). Bartell et al. (2011) reported that intracerebroventricular administration of leptin to obob mice increases expression of SP7, a transcription factor critical for osteoblast differentiation. Our findings of low expression of SP7 in obob mice support the hypothesis that leptin acts to regulate bone formation by controlling mesenchymal cell decision. In the present study, pair feeding to WT mice resulted in a further increase in bone marrow adiposity in leptin-deficient obob mice. Of interest is our finding that pair-fed obob mice had elevated mRNA levels for CD36; CD36 (fatty acid translocase) promotes adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis (Christiaens, et al. 2012). The observed increase in CD36 may play a role in the increased bone marrow adiposity observed in the pair-fed obob mice. Additional factors regulating bone marrow adiposity that may be influenced by leptin levels and obesity include growth hormone and IGF1. In rats, treatment with parathyroid hormone (whose actions on bone are largely mediated through IGF1) prevented the increase in bone marrow adiposity associated with severe energy restriction (Turner and Iwaniec 2011), whereas growth hormone treatment dramatically reduced excessive bone marrow adiposity in severely hypoleptinemic hypophysectomized rats (Menagh et al. 2010). In both of these studies, treatment had no effect on serum leptin levels. obob mice, however, have decreased circulating growth hormone and impaired growth hormone signaling (Luque, et al. 2007), likely contributing to retention of fat within the bone marrow. High circulating insulin levels in morbidly obese obob mice may further contribute to the suppression of growth hormone synthesis and release (Luque and Kineman 2006). However, IGF1 is produced and secreted by adipocytes (Kloting, et al. 2008) and higher levels of IGF1 are detected in obese subjectsTurner et al. Page 11 J Endocrinol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 July 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript(Frystyk, et al. 1999). Low leptin levels resulting from severe energy restriction are associated with increased growth hormone secretion, decreased circulating levels of IGF1, and end-organ resistance to growth hormone (Douyon and Schteingart 2002; Grinspoon, et al. 1995; Inagaki, et al. 2008; Munoz and Argente 2002; Thissen, et al. 1999). Thus, disturbances in growth hormone, IGF1 and insulin signaling as well as leptin deficiency may contribute to the increase in bone marrow adiposity in obob mice. Chronic hyperphagia and excessive weight gain typically observed in obob mice may partially compensate for leptin deficiency and reduced bone marrow adiposity by altering growth hormone and insulin levels and sensitivity. In summary, leptin deficiency resulted in decreased femur length, BMC, BMD, and cortical bone volume and thickness. In contrast, cancellous bone volume fraction was increased in distal femur and lumbar vertebra. The profound changes in bone mass, density, and microarchitecture were associated with reduced linear bone growth, increased bone marrow adiposity, altered expression of osteogenic genes, decreased osteoblast number, and decreased osteoclast function. Prevention of morbid obesity in obob mice further exacerbated many of the abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency. Because morbid obesity normally present in obob mice attenuates the abnormal skeletal phenotype associated with leptin deficiency, the role of leptin in regulating postnatal bone growth, maturation, and turnover may have been underestimated.

        "introduction": "Leptin, a polypeptide hormone secreted by adipocytes, is best known for its role in the regulation of appetite and energy metabolism (Mistry, et al. 1997; Myers 2004). Rodents deficient in leptin signaling, due to either an inability to generate leptin ( obob mice) or the signaling form of the leptin receptor ( dbdb mice and fafa rats), become morbidly obese (Clement 2000). Their excess weight is the result of a combination of hyperphagia and reduced thermogenesis (Hwa, et al. 1996). In addition to morbid obesity, leptin deficiency is associated with hypogonadism (Barkan, et al. 2005), elevated corticosteroid levels (Saito and Bray 1983), and impaired thermoregulation (Trayhurn and James 1978). Leptin-deficient mice and leptin receptor-deficient mice and rats have reduced overall bone mass, reduced longitudinal bone growth (Kishida, et al. 2005; Steppan, et al. 2000), and decreased bone formation (Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008). In addition, impaired bone resorption in obob and dbdb mice results in mild osteopetrosis (Turner, et al. 2013), a condition which may contribute to the reported reductions in bone quality observed in these animals (Ealey, et al. 2006; Kimura, et al. 2012). Impaired bone resorption may also account for the age- and bone-dependent variation in cancellous bone volume observed in leptin signaling-deficient mice; the mutant mice are reported to have normal to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra and decreased to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in long bones (Hamrick, et al. 2004; Iwaniec, et al. 2007; Williams, et al. 2011). The skeletal abnormalities observed in mice and rats with defective leptin signaling suggest that leptin plays a role in normal skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover (Bartell, et al. 2011; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Kishida et al. 2005; Steppan et al. 2000; Turner et al. 2013). However, it is not clear to what extent the skeletal phenotype of obob mice is impacted by additional factors associated with morbid obesity. Although rare in humans, leptin signaling deficiency occurs as a result of loss of function mutations in the genes for leptin and the leptin receptor (Friedman and Halaas 1998). More common causes for low leptin signaling in humans include anorexia and starvation (Dardeno, et al. 2010; Muller, et al. 2009). At the other end of the spectrum, diet-induced leptin resistance, associated with chronically elevated leptin levels, mimics many of the metabolic consequences of leptin deficiency on energy metabolism and is thought to contribute to development of morbid obesity (Jung and Kim 2013). Thus, changes in leptin levels andor leptin sensitivity could have physiological effects on bone metabolism. In order to better understand the specific actions of leptin in regulating bone mass, density and architecture, we performed a study in which differences in body weight gain between rapidly growing wild type (WT) and obob mice were prevented by housing all mice at thermoneutral temperature (32C) to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure (Trayhurn 1979) and pair-feeding the mutant mice to WT mice to equalize food intake.Turner et al.
