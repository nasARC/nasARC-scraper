When the RWV is completely lled with medium and rotation initiated, cells are maintained in a physiological low uid shear suspension culture environment with high mass transfer of nutrients andwaste, which is optimal for growth and differentiation. 4,21 We previously used the RWV to establish highly differentiated 3- D intestinal organotypic models derived from human epithelial cell lines and demonstrated their ability to predict in vivo infectionoutcomes and Salmonella pathogenic mechanisms.7,1618While initiated from a single cell type, these epithelial models spontaneously differentiated into multiple epithelial cell typesnormally found in the intestine, including enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and MM-like cells, while exhibiting extensive tight junction formation, apical-basolateral polarity, and mucin produc- tion. Following infection with Salmonella Typhimurium, these 3-D epithelial models exhibited phenotypes consistent with in vivoinfections in animals and humans, including alterations in tissue morphology, adherence, invasion, apoptosis, and production of cytokines. 7,1618Moreover, S.Typhimurium invaded 3-D intestinal cells independently of all known Salmonella type three secretion systems, i.e. SPI-1, SPI-2, and the agellar secretory system,7a major nding that paralleled in vivo infection observations in both animals and humans,2227and challenged the paradigm estab- lished by 2-D monolayers that SPI-1 is always required for invasionof intestinal epithelium. Similar results were recently reported using a 3-D intestinal organoid model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, which showed that a TyphimuriuminvA mutant was still able to invade into the model, albeit at lower levels than the wild type. 6Collectively, these ndings demonstrate the utility of 3-D tissue models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms. These results led us to postulate that our 3-D intestinal epithelial model could serve as a high delity platform for engineering an improved version able to better recapitulate the multicellular complex- ity normally encountered by Salmonella during enteric infection.

HT-29 cells were initiated as adherent monolayers and U937 cells as suspension cultures. U937 cells (1  107) were treated with PMA for 48 h in the presence of ECM-coated, porous microcarrier beads to allow attachment. Following treatment, PMA wasremoved from the U937 cells. At the same time, HT-29 cells were trypsinized, counted and added (2  106) to the U937-bead mix. The RWV was loaded with cultures, lled completely with media, and bubbles removed.

Typhimurium, ST313, which has undergone genome degradation similar to thatof host-adapted S. Typhi. 32S.Typhimurium is classi ed as a generalist in terms of its host speci city, causing disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. While usually associated with self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans, S.Typhimurium can cause serious systemic infection in the immunocompromised. Conver-sely, S.Typhi is a human-speci c pathogen that causes systemic illness and typhoid fever. 3,33Thus, there is concern that ST313 may be evolving toward a human-speci c adaptation similar to Typhi. However, very limited information is available regardinghost-pathogen interaction characteristics and host speci city of ST313, although recent studies using ST313 strain D23580 found that it causes invasive disease in animals and lethal disease in mice, indicating it is not a human-speci c pathovar. 3436Herein, we report advancement of our previously developed 3- D HT-29 intestinal epithelial model7,17into a multicellular, co- culture model that provides additional complexity relevant to the intestinal microenvironment by incorporation of immune compe- tent cells; speci cally, functional macrophages. As 3-D intestinal epithelial models have been repeatedly shown to better mimic the differentiated structurefunction of intestinal tissues, and respond in a more in vivo-like manner to challenge with entericpathogens than 2-D monolayers, our comparisons in this studythus focused on the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models. 7,1719,37 Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of the HT-29- U937 co-culture model revealed key in vivo-like structural andfunctional characteristics. To assess the impact of macrophages inthis new co-culture model and validate its application as a human surrogate infection platform, we applied it to characterize infection pro les between closely related Salmonella enterica pathovars with different disease phenotypes and host tropisms (Typhimurium strains SL1344 and ST313 D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2). To further enhance the physiological relevance of the study,bacteria were cultured under aerobic or microaerobic conditionsprior to infection, as Salmonella must adapt to a broad range of oxygen levels during its normal life cycle both before and after entry into the host. This includes aerobic conditions prior toingestion, anaerobic conditions in the lumen, and microaerobicconditions approaching the intestinal wall. 38Our studies revealed that the 3-D co-culture model could discriminate between Salmonella pathovars and represents an innovative model for Fig. 2 3-D co-culture model validation.

To our knowledge, this work represents the rst RWV-derived 3- D co-culture model of intestinal epithelium and macrophages. This study is an important step forward in developing a 3-D intestinal epithelial co-culture model that integrates immune cells to mimicthe multicellular complexity of the parental tissue and itsapplication to understand the synergistic contribution of different cell types to enteric host-pathogen interactions. RESULTS Development of a novel 3-D co-culture model Our previous 3-D model of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells 7,16,17was advanced in this study by the inclusion of U937 monocytes that were pre-differentiated into macrophages by PMA (Figs. 12). The microcarrier bead scaffolds used for culturing 3-D cells resulted inestablishment of an inside-out intestinal model, wherein the luminal side of the cells faces the culture media, which facilitates access of Salmonella to the host-pathogen interface naturally encountered during intestinal infection. Cells are attached to ECM-coated porous beads through their basal surface and are in contact with the external milieu at their apical surface, which is relevant to the architecture of the parental tissue. In order todevelop the novel 3-D co-culture model, we had to design andoptimize several experimental parameters including order of addition and ratio of the two cell types (HT-29 and U937) and the activation state of U937 cells upon addition to the model. Wefound that the addition of U937 cells to a partially or fullyestablished 3-D epithelial model did not result in adequate incorporation of the U937 cells into the model, nor did it allow for the U937 cells to be incorporated beneath or within theepithelium, as would be relevant to the in vivo scenario. Inaddition, although we previously found that the addition of U937 monocytes to a 3-D alveolar epithelial lung model naturally stimulated their activation into functional macrophages, 10we did notnd this to be the case when these same cells were added to our 3-D colon model in our current study. Thus, we decided to pre- bind the U937 cells to the collagen I-coated microcarrier beads and activate using PMA. Following PMA removal, the cell-beadcomplexes were introduced into the RWV bioreactor together withthe HT-29 cells. Using this optimized procedure, we found that immuno uorescence pro ling revealed the presence of differ- entiated intestinal epithelial cells as well as macrophages, thelatter of which were integrated both between epithelial cells andunderneath the epithelium (Fig. 2). We then attempted to enumerate the ratio of epithelial cells to macrophages withinthenal model; however, we were unable to successfully remove U937 cells from the microcarrier beads using either trypsin, collagenase or a combination of the two enzymes. Validation of newly developed 3-D co-culture model Distribution of markers normally expressed by intestinal epithe- lium was pro led using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Adherens and tight junctional markers -catenin and ZO-1, respectively, were found localized at contact zones between adjacent cells in both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models (Fig. 2A, panels a, b, f and g). Mucins (MUC5AC, MUC2) and Sialyl Lewis A antigen (M-cell marker) were expressed in the 3-D co- culture model and showed a similar expression pattern as compared to the epithelial model (Fig. 2A, panels c e and h j). Secretion of mucins indicates the presence of goblet cells, while expression of Sialyl Lewis A demonstrates potential presence of M cells. As with the 3-D epithelial model, 7,17these ndings indicate the presence of various differentiated intestinal epithelial cell types in the 3-D co-culture model. U937 cells were identi ed using well-de ned markers expressed by macrophages including CD45, CD68 and CD84.9,3941Each of these markers was expressed exclusively in the 3-D co-cultures (Fig. 2B) but not in the epithelial model (Supplementary Fig. S1). Macrophages were found integrated among the epithelium of the3-D co-culture model and were observed in the models through at least 16 days of culture (Fig. 2B). The phagocytic activity of macrophages was assessed by pro ling the uptake of inert, bacteria-sized (2 m) uorescent beads. The 3-D co-culture, but not the epithelial model, contained cells with high concentrations of internalized uorescent beads (Fig. 2B, panel d; Supplementary Fig.S1, panel d), indicating phagocytic activity by macrophages in 3-D co-culture. Application of 3-D co-culture model to study host-pathogen colonization by Salmonella pathovars The contribution of macrophages to Salmonella infection was analyzed using a gentamicin protection assay to comparecolonization pro les (adherence, invasion and intracellular survi- val) between Typhimurium strains SL1344 and D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2 in the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models. Bacteriawere cultured under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions prior to infection (Fig. 3and Supplementary Fig. S2). All Salmonella strains were recovered at signi cantly lower numbers in the Fig. 3 Salmonella pathovars colonize 3-D co-culture model at lower levels than 3-D epithelial model. Bacteria were cultured under microaerobic conditions. Triplicate wells of either the co-culture ( white bars ) or epithelial model ( black bars ) were infected at an MOI of 10:1. Following infection, host cells were incubated for either A30 min (adherence), B3 h (invasion), or C24 h (intracellular survival). For each time point serial dilutions of the host cell lysate were plated to assess CFUmL. All data were normalized to the initial bacterial inoculum for each strain. Error bars represent the standard deviation from two biological replicates, each conducted in technical triplicate. Statistically signi cant differences for each strain between the co-culture and epithelial models are indicated as () p0.05; () p0.01; or () p0.0013-D intestinal co-culture model for Salmonella infection J Barrila et al. 4 npj Microgravity (2017) Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAco-culture model containing functional macrophages relative to the epithelial model for all colonization time points. Decreased colonization of the 3-D co-culture model was observed regardless of the oxygen condition under which the bacteria were cultured(Fig. 3and Supplementary Fig. S2). Model-speci c differences in adherence pro les of Typhimurium vs. Typhi We observed distinct patterns in the adherence of S. Typhi strain Ty2 relative to the two NTS strains (SL1344 and D23580). Ty2adhered to the 3-D epithelial model at greater levels than either ofthe NTS strains (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). This difference was completely abrogated in the 3-D co-culture model containing functional macrophages, as all strains displayed decreased adherence with no statistical differences observed(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Although all strains adhered to the 3-D co-culture model at lower levels than the epithelial model, there was a signi cantly larger reduction in the adherence of Ty2 compared to the NTS strains (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Regardless of oxygen conditions, Ty2 displayed an 8-foldreduction in adherence to the co-culture model relative to the epithelial model, while NTS strains only displayed a 3 to 4-fold reduction in adherence. The large decreases in Salmonella adherence to the 3-D co-culture model could potentially be dueto changes in the expression andor localization of surface receptors in the host that occurred with the inclusion of activated macrophages with the epithelial cells. Previous studies haveshown that the cystic brosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important receptor for Typhi 42,43and has also been found to internalize within colonic crypt epithelial cells in a mouse model of Typhimurium-induced enteritis.44However, immunohistochemical pro ling of our uninfected 3-D epithelial and co-culture models revealed no differences in the localization or expression of CFTR that would explain these differences in adherence (data not shown). Oxygen-speci c differences in invasion and replicationsurvival proles of Salmonella pathovars When analyzed as a percentage of the number of bacteria that adhered, we found that microaerobically grown Salmonella exhibited different invasion pro les in the 3-D co-culture as compared to the epithelial model (Figs. 45). Figure 4shows statistical comparisons for each strain between oxygen conditions. Microaerobic culture decreased invasiveness of SL1344 and Ty2 inthe epithelial model, while no differences were observed forD23580 between the two oxygen conditions. Conversely, in the 3-D co-culture model, SL1344 and Ty2 displayed no oxygen- related trends, while microaerobic culture enhanced the invasionof D23580. These data indicate that the multicellular complexity ofthe host model used to pro le oxygen-dependent invasion properties is an important factor. We also found that D23580 displayed distinct colonization patterns relative to SL1344 and Ty2(Fig. 5). Although D23580 and SL1344 adhered to both the 3-D Fig. 4 Microaerobic culture enhances the invasiveness of adherent D23580 in the 3-D co-culture model. SL1344 ( gray bars ), D23580 (black bars ) and Ty2 ( white bars ) were cultured under either aerobic conditions ( black border ) or microaerobic conditions ( red border ) and used to infect the 3-D epithelial or 3-D co-culture model. All data foreach strain were normalized to the number of bacteria that adhered. Statistically signi cant differences for each strain between oxygen conditions are indicated as () p0.05 or () p0.001.

However, D23580 replicatedsurvived at higher levels in both 3-D models than either SL1344 or Ty2 following invasion (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S4). This occurred when the bacteria were cultured under either oxygen condition, withthe aerobically cultured D23580 replicatingsurviving approxi-mately 2.1-fold higher than microaerobically cultured bacteria in the 3-D co-culture model (Fig. 5B,p 0.05). No difference between the two oxygen conditions was observed in the replicationsurvival of D23580 in the 3-D epithelial model (Supplementary Fig.S4). Immunohistochemical pro ling of 3-D models following infection We performed immunohistochemical pro ling at 24 h post- infection (h.p.i.) to characterize the distributionco-localizationpatterns of the different Salmonella pathovars within the 3-D co- culture and epithelial models (Figs. 68; Supplementary Figs. S5 S6). In both of the 3-D models infected with SL1344, bacteria were often observed to co-localize with host cells as dense intracellularclusters (Fig. 6A, panel a; Supplementary Fig. S5). When the 3-D co- culture model was infected by SL1344 grown aerobically, macrophages were rarely observed and bacteria were foundpredominantly in epithelial cells (Fig. 6A, panel a). In contrast, when SL1344 was grown microaerobically, a greater number of macrophages were present (Fig. 6A, panel d, insets); however, while some macrophages were found to contain internalized bacteria (Fig. 6A, panel d, right inset and Fig. 6B, panel b), most were empty (Fig. 6A, panel d, left inset and Fig. 6B, panel a), with the majority of SL1344 associated with epithelial cells. In contrast to SL1344 infection, macrophages were readily found when D23580 was grown aerobically, with bacteria associating with both epithelial cells and macrophages in 3-D co-culture (Fig. 6A, panel b). However, when D23580 was grown microaerobically, it was rarely found in macrophages (Fig. 6A, panel e, inset). Within D23580-infected cells, the bacterial load per cell (in either macrophages or epithelial cells) appeared much lower when compared to those infected with SL1344, withbacteria forming a predominantly punctate pattern with occa- sional intracellular clustering (Fig. 6A, panels b and e; Supple- mentary Fig. S5). In line with the colonization data, the total number of host cells (regardless of host cell type) infected with Ty2 appeared to bemuch lower in both 3-D models relative to SL1344 and D23580. When infected cells were found, they were often completely lled with bacteria (Fig. 6A, panels c and f; Fig. 7). In the 3-D co-culture model, we observed that when Ty2 was grown aerobically, itlocalized predominantly to epithelial cells, with the majority of macrophages empty. In the rare event that Ty2 co-localized with macrophages, these cells were almost always completely  lled with bacteria, forming giant macrophages (Fig. 6A, panel c, inset). In contrast, we did not nd any Ty2-infected macrophages when the bacteria were grown microaerobically (Fig. 6A, panel f, inset). Instead, Ty2 formed large clusters within epithelial cells (Fig. 6A, panel f; Fig. 7). We also examined mucus production following infection. We observed enhanced expression of MUC5AC following infection in both 3-D models relative to uninfected controls (Fig. 8and Supplementary Fig. S7), although no clear differences in mucus production between individual pathovars was observed. DISCUSSION An improved understanding of the transition between normal intestinal homeostasis and disease caused by enteric pathogens will be facilitated by development of organotypic intestinal cellculture models that mimic the 3-D architecture and multicellular complexity present in the parental tissue in vivo. In this study, we advanced our previously characterized 3-D model of human colonic epithelium7,16,17towards a more immunocompetent 3-D model through the co-culture of HT-29 cells and phagocytic U937macrophages using the RWV bioreactor. To our knowledge, this model represents the rst RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model comprised of intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages. The newly developed 3-D co-culture model shares key characteristics with the 3-D epithelial model from which it was derived,17including apical-basolateral polarity, well-organized tight junctions, expression of mucins, and evidence of multipleepithelial cell types present in vivo, including goblet cells and M-cells (Fig. 2A). The key advancement made in this work was the incorporation of phagocytic macrophages into the epithelial model in order to more closely approximate in vivo multicellularcomplexity, architecture and function. This is an important feature, as the gastrointestinal mucosa contains the largest population of tissue macrophages in the body, which play a critical role inprotecting the host from pathogens, including Salmonella . 45,46A previous study reported the incorporation of lymphocytes into a 3-D RWV intestinal epithelial model for enteric infection; however macrophages were not included in the model.47 When we applied both our 3-D co-culture and epithelial models to evaluate the colonization pro les of distinct Salmonella pathovars, we found that the presence of macrophages in the 3-D co-culture model had an inhibitory effect on the adherence,invasion and survival of all strains evaluated relative to the epithelial model, which contained epithelial cells only (Fig. 3). This inhibition could be due to an overall increased resistance tocolonization as a result of cross talk between the epithelial cellsand the macrophages or increased killing of the bacteria by the macrophages andor epithelial cells. In either scenario, these ndings are in alignment with the known role of macrophages in vivo to protect the host against enteric pathogens 45,48and further emphasize the important role of immune cells in the early interactions between the pathogen and host. We also found that Typhi adhered to the 3-D epithelial model at much higher levels than the Typhimurium strains (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). This enhanced adherence was eliminated when the same strains were used to infect the 3-D co-culture model (epithelial cells plus macrophages), with the Ty2 adherencesigni cantly more impacted by the presence of macrophages in the co-culture model than NTS strains D23580 and SL1344 (Supplementary Fig. S3, panel B). Previous monolayer studies using a single host cell type (epithelial cells or macrophages) haveproduced con icting results regarding the differences in coloniza- tion between Typhi and Typhimurium, with some studies reporting that Typhimurium adheres and invades at higher levelsthan Typhi and others nding the precise opposite. 33,4951 Genomic comparisons between Typhi and Typhimurium have revealed discrete differences between the two serovars in genes known to be important for bacterial adherence, including mbrial and Vi capsule genes (the latter speci c to Typhi).5257While some studies have characterized the phenotypic impact of those differences,5861the adherence and invasion mechanisms of Typhi are still not fully understood, due in part to the limits ofthe current experimental models for human-speci c infectious diseases. The expression, localization and conformation of surface structures present on both the host and pathogen play importantroles in initiating infection. 62,63It is well established that the expression and localization of a variety of surface markers can be altered when cells are cultured in 3-D relative to their 2-D counterparts, with the former condition often closely re ecting the in vivo-scenario.4,10,12,64,65Moreover, it has been previously shown in both 3-D10and 2-D66cultures that the co-culture of epithelial cells and macrophages can lead to alterations in theexpression of cell surface proteins. Thus the large decrease we3-D intestinal co-culture model for Salmonella infection J Barrila et al. 6 npj Microgravity (2017) Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAobserved in Salmonella adherence to the 3-D co-culture model could potentially be due to changes in the expression andorlocalization of surface receptors in the host that occurred with the inclusion of macrophages with the epithelial cells. It was shown previously that CFTR is an important receptor for Typhi.42,43We hypothesized that the inclusion of activated macrophages in the3-D co-culture model could lead to altered localization andor expression of the CFTR receptor in a manner that could explain the drastic decrease in Typhi adherence between the epithelialand co-culture models relative to the Typhimurium serovars. However, under the conditions of this study we observed no differences by immunohistochemical pro ling in its localization or expression between the two models. Another alterative explana-tion is that the Typhi strain was killed at higher levels than the NTS strains by the either the macrophages, the epithelial cells, or both. Studies are ongoing in our laboratory to investigate themechanistic basis for these differences. We were particularly interested in applying our 3-D organoid models to study the colonization characteristics of ST313 strain D23580 relative to the classic Typhimurium and Typhi strainsSL1344 and Ty2, respectively. D23580, a representative ST313 clinical isolate, has undergone genome reduction similar to that ofother human-restricted serovars like Typhi. 32ST313 strains are often referred to as highly invasive , as they are predominantly recovered from the bloodstream of patients.32,35,50,67,68 However, results from research into the invasiveness and survival of ST313 relative to classic Salmonella strains using in vitro models have been somewhat contradictory.36,50,69,70Animal studies by our lab and others have indicated that gastrointestinal coloniza-tion by ST313 (including D23580) is low, with rapid spread to systemic tissues.34,35In our current study, we found that D23580 invaded both the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models atsigni cantly lower levels than SL1344 (Fig. 3B). When we evaluated the survival of each strain relative to the number of invaded bacteria, D23580 replicatedsurvived better than either SL1344 or Ty2 in both of the 3-D models (Fig. 5B). These ndings suggest that D23580 may spread more ef ciently throughout the infected host relative to classic Typhimurium due to its inherent intracellular survival properties rather than an ability to invade at higher levels. Additional possibilities to explain the enhanced Fig. 6 Different co-localization patterns of Salmonella pathovars in the 3-D co-culture model. ACells were xed 24 h.p.i. with SL1344 ( a,d), D23580 ( b,e) or Ty2 ( c,f) that were cultured aerobically ( ac) or microaerobically ( df).

The 3-D co-culture and epithelial models could also distinguish between the Salmonella pathovars grown under limited oxygen. As facultative anaerobes, salmonellae encounter and respond to a wide range of oxygen levels both in the environment and in vivo. Studies have reported that limiting oxygen conditions increase theadherence and invasiveness of Salmonella when used to infect pure monolayer cultures of either epithelial cells or macro- phages. 7173We did not nd that low oxygen increased the adherence or invasiveness of any of the strains tested using eitherof our highly differentiated 3-D cell culture models when data were normalized to the initial inoculum, although Typhi did display an upward trend in adherence in the 3-D epithelial modelfollowing microaerobic culture ( p 0.07, Supplementary Fig. S3C). When invasion data were analyzed relative to the number of bacteria that had adhered, we found microaerobic culture decreased invasiveness of SL1344 and Ty2, yet had no effect onST313 strain D23580 in the epithelial model (Fig. 4). However, in the co-culture model a different trend was observed: SL1344 and Ty2 displayed no oxygen-related differences in invasion, while microaerobic culture enhanced invasion of D23580 that hadadhered to the model. The enhanced invasive capabilities of D23580 pre-adapted to low oxygen was not observed in the 3-D epithelial model (the more reductionist model; Fig. 4), nor was it observed when the data were analyzed as a percentage of theinitial inoculum. These results suggest that although low oxygen may not increase the ability for D23580 to adhere to the host, the bacteria that are able attach are able to invade or be taken up athigher levels than when they are pre-adapted to higher oxygenconditions. Moreover, this enhanced invasionuptake was only observed in the 3-D co-culture model, indicating that the macrophages play a key role in this increased invasion phenotypeeither directly through increased uptake of D23580 or indirectly through cross talk to the epithelium. Intriguingly, although microaerobic culture enhanced the invasiveness of D23580 that had adhered, it did not enhance the survival of those that invadedas much as when the bacteria were cultured aerobically (Fig. 5B). This difference was not observed in the 3-D epithelial model for D23580 grown under the two oxygen conditions (Supplementary Fig.S4). One advantage of using a multicellular in vitro host model system is the ability to visualize the co-localization patterns of each strain relative to the different host cell types. We found that each of the Salmonella pathovars displayed distinct patterns in their clustering and host cell speci city (Fig. 6). Regardless of the model being infected (3-D co-culture or epithelial), SL1344- infected cells were abundant in samples imaged at the intracellular survivalreplication time point (24 h.p.i.), with thebacteria forming dense intracellular clusters within infected cells. D23580 formed more punctate patterns with occasional intracel- lular clustering and what appeared to be lower numbers ofbacteria relative to SL1344- or Ty2-infected models. Although Ty2-infected cells were more dif cult to nd relative to SL1344 and D23580, when infected cells were found (epithelial cells or macrophages), they were completely packed full of bacteria.These distinct phenotypes observed may be related, in part, todifferences in the survival andor dissemination strategies between the three strains. During S. enterica infections, bacteria grow within cells and are subsequently re-distributed amongnearby uninfected cells in order to form new infection foci that become pathological lesions. 7477There is a heterogeneous expansion within tissues, with most phagocytes displaying lowbacterial numbers and small number heavily infected.74,7678It has been previously shown in mice that Salmonella strains defective in SPI-2 are still able to grow to high intracellular densities, but have dif culty exiting the cells and re-distributing within tissues, leading to a lower net growth within organs andhigher bacterial loads for the small numbers of infected cells.78 This phenotype resembles what we observed with Typhi in ourhuman 3-D organotypic models. Several SPI-2 effectors present in Fig. 7 3-D perspective of intracellular Salmonella in epithelial cells. The co-culture model was xed 24 h.p.i. with SL1344, D23580, or Ty2 grown microaerobically, stained with anti- Salmonella antibody ( green ) and DAPI ( blue, nuclei), and imaged with CLSM (Magni cation 400).

We also observed that the oxygen condition under which the bacteria had been cultured prior to the start of the infectionaltered the host cell co-localization distribution pattern betweenepithelial cells and macrophages (Fig. 6and Supplementary Fig.S5). When SL1344 was cultured aerobically, it was very dif cult to locate any macrophages in the co-culture model at 24 h.p.i., suggesting that SL1344 may have induced apoptosis in these cells;a phenotype previously observed in SL1344-infected macro-phages. 30,50,70,81In contrast, macrophages were found in D23580- and Ty2-infected models, with both strains co-localizingwith intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages when the bacteriawere cultured aerobically. These ndings are in agreement with reports showing that SL1344 induces higher levels of apoptosis inmacrophages than Typhi 30,70,81and ST313 strains50,70when cultured under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, when SL1344 wascultured under low oxygen conditions, macrophages were readilyfound within the model, some of which contained bacteria whileothers were empty (Fig. 6A, panel d ). Likewise, we found more empty macrophages in the model when D23580 and Ty2 werecultured microaerobically (Fig. 6A, panels e and f). Possible explanations for these infection patterns following culture of thebacteria under low oxygen conditions prior to infection include: (1) pathogen avoidance of macrophages, (2) speci c targeting of epithelial cells, (3) enhanced intracellular killing within macro-phages, andor (4) a masking effect whereby the macrophages areunable to detect the pathogen, leading to lower levels of uptake.When we compared our co-culture imaging results at 24 h to theco-culture colonization data at the same time point (Fig. 5B), both SL1344 and D23580 displayed an 2-fold decrease ( p 0.05) in replicationsurvival when the bacteria were cultured underoxygen-limiting conditions relative to aerobic cultures. However,Ty2 displayed no signi cant differences in replicationsurvivalbetween the two oxygen conditions (Fig. 5). Future studies will focus on further investigating the mechanisms underlying thesedifferences. CONCLUSIONS In summary, the 3-D co-culture model of human colonic epithelium in combination with immune cells that was engineered, validated and tested in this study represents a new tool to investigatemechanisms underlying enteric diseases with both non-infectiousand infectious etiologies, including salmonellosis. Phagocytic macrophages were incorporated in the model in order to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity and structure of theparental tissue, thereby allowing for synergistic contributions ofdifferent cell types during infection to be assessed so that host- pathogen interactions can be studied in a more physiologically relevant context. In addition, we also demonstrated that this modelcould be used for investigations into the impact of differentenvironmental parameters on colonization as well as co-localization patterns of pathogens with different host cell types. These ndings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related modelswith increasing complexity to study infectious disease mechanisms.Using this approach, we identi ed key microenvironmental factors (i.e., host multicellular complexity and oxygen) important for regulating pathovar-speci c invasion and host co-localization properties. We continue to enhance the physiological relevanceof these models by incorporation of additional cell types that are normally found in the tissue in vivo, including the use of primary cells, dendritic cells, B cells and T cells, which will continue toadvance our mechanistic understanding of enteric infectiousdisease in the context of the host-microenvironment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 and D23580, S. Typhi Ty2, and E. coli HB101 were used in this study. Bacterial cultures were initiated under Fig. 8 MUC5AC production by the 3-D co-culture and 3-D epithelial models following infection with Salmonella pathovars cultured under microaerobic conditions. The 3-D co-culture model ( ad) and 3-D epithelial model ( eh) were xed 24 h.p.i. with either SL1344 ( a,e), D23580 (b,f) or Ty2 ( c,g) that had been cultured under microaerobic conditions. Time-matched uninfected controls are shown ( d,h). Cultures were co-stained with a MUC5AC antibody ( yellow ), an anti- Salmonella antibody ( green ), and the cell nuclei stained with DAPI ( blue).

Overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 into fresh LB. For microaerobic studies, LB media was pre- ushed with a mixed gas comprised of 2 O 2,6 C O 2, and 92 N 2and inoculations took place within a Coy chamber which was maintained using the same gas mixture. Oxygen levels in the chamber were monitored by an O 2sensor and remained between 2.1 2.4 for the duration of the culture. Both aerobic and microaerobic cultures were grown at 37 C and 180 rpm to late log phase, and immediately thereafter used for infection assays. To con rm bacterial strains were at the same phase of growth, growth curves wereperformed under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions by plating for viable colony-forming units per mL (CFUmL) and measuring the corresponding OD 600(data not shown). Human cell lines and culture conditions The human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 and the humanmonocytic cell line U93782were obtained from ATCC (HTB-38 and CRL- 1593.2, respectively). These cell lines were chosen for this study as both represent model cell types commonly used to study Salmonella -host interactions, and thus there is extensive published literature for comparison. Moreover, U937 cells are well suited for this study, as they can be differentiated into adherent phagocytic cells that exhibit many key morphological and functional properties of macrophages, including phagocytosis. GTSF-2 medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10 heat- inactivated FBS (Life Technologies), 2.5 mgL ITS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.25 gL sodium bicarbonate was used for all studies, and cells were maintained at 37 C, 10 CO 2. HT-29 cells were initiated as monolayers and U937 cells as a suspension culture, the latter of which was maintained at therecommended cell density of 2  10521 06cellsmL. U937 cells (1  107) were added to 0.25 g porous Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been prepared according to the manufacturer s instructions. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) (108M) was added to GTSF-2 to induce characteristics of terminally differentiated macro- phages.83The mix was evenly distributed into 6-well plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 C, 10 CO 2. Following incubation, PMA-differentiated U937 cells bound to microcarrier beads were gently rinsed with GTSF-2 media and combined with HT-29 cells (2  106). Cultures were loaded into the RWV, which was then lled completely with culture media, and bubbles removed. Cultures were incubated statically for 15 30 min. prior to initiating rotation (20 rpm), monitored daily and small bubbles removed if observed. GTSF-2 was replenished after the rst 4 5 days and then every 24 h thereafter until the harvest of cultures at 15 16 days. The 3-D HT-29 epithelial cultures17served as controls and were grown in parallel with the 3-D co-culture model for all studies. Bead uptake assays The phagocytic activity of macrophages was assessed as previouslydescribed,10,84based on uptake of bacteria-sized (2 M) Fluoresbrite YG Microspheres (Polysciences). Brie y, 3-D aggregates (2  106cells) of either the co-culture or epithelial model were incubated with 108uorescent beads for 30 min at 37 C and 10 CO 2in 6-well plates (5 mL medium). Following incubation, the aggregates were rinsed in triplicate with cold Dulbecco s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Invitrogen) to remove non- phagocytosed beads and xed using 4 paraformaldehyde (PFA). Following a 30-minute incubation, aggregates were rinsed in triplicate with DPBS and further processed for imaging with CLSM as described below. Infection studies Upon reaching optimal differentiation as determined by immunohisto-chemical pro ling, 3-D cell culture models were harvested from the RWV, assayed for viability, and seeded into multi-well plates to a nal density of 1  106cellswell. A gentamicin protection assay was then performed as described previously.7,17Briey, bacteria were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 10. Samples were plated for viable CFU mL for adherence (30 min), invasion (3 h) and intracellular survival (24 h). For each time point, host cells were washed 2 3 times with HBSS, lysed with 0.1 sodium deoxycholate, and serial dilutions of the lysate plated on LB agar to assess CFU per mL. Gentamicin was added after the 30-min (50 gmL) and 3 h (10 gmL) time points in order to eliminate remaining extracellular bacteria. Percent adherence was calculated by normalizingthe CFUmL obtained at 30 min to the initial bacterial inoculum for each strain. Percent invasion and survivalreplication were calculated asindicated in the gure legend, either by normalizing to the initial bacterial inoculum or to the total CFU obtained for the previous time point. Allstatistical comparisons were made in Graphpad using the Student st-test (p 0.05). Two independent biological trials were performed for each experiment, with three technical replicates per trial. Time-matched controls were included for all studies using the non-invasive E. coli strain HB101 and untreated samples (latter for imaging studies). Immunohistochemical pro ling Fixation, staining and imaging of 3-D aggregates was performed as previously described.7,10Samples were imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 microscope. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. For 3-Dperspectives, image stacks acquired by CLSM were median ltered using a (3  3) kernel for noise reduction and then gamma corrected (gamma 0.75)to compensate for image dynamic range. Processed image stacks for eachuorescence channel were then rendered as 3-D perspective surface using an isovolume lter with the open-source image visualization engine ParaView (Henderson A. 2007. ParaView Guide, A Parallel VisualizationApplication. Kitware, Inc.). Antibodies were purchased from Abcam (CD45,-catenin, CD84); Life Technologies (ZO-1, MUC5AC); BioLegend (CD68); Kamiya Biomedical (Sialyl Lewis A); and KPL ( Salmonella CSA-1). All antibodies were used at a nal dilution of 1:50 in blocking solution (3 BSA, 0.05 Triton X-100 in DPBS) with the exception of anti- -catenin and anti-Sialyl Lewis A, which were used at a nal dilution of 1:100. Goat anti- mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) wasused at a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution for detecting primaryantibodies, with the exception of anti-CD68 and anti- Salmonella CSA-1, which were FITC-conjugated. For dual labeling purposes with CD45 andMUC5AC, a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was used that was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies).
