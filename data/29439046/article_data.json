The draft genomes of strains 1P01SCT, FO-92T, 50v1, and 2P01AA had sizes of 5,500,894 bp, 4,699,376 bp, 3,174,402 bp, and 4,328,804 bp, respec-tively. Bacillus horneckiae strain 1P01SCTwas isolated from a spacecraft assembly clean room at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), where the Phoenix spacecraft was assembled (1). As previously reported, spores of this strain were resistant to UV254radiation up to 1,000 J mH110022.Bacillus nealsonii FO-92Twas isolated from fall-out particles collected from a spacecraft assembly facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( 2). Spores of FO-92Thave exhibited resistances to UV254up to 300 J mH110022, and vegetative cells and spores of this organism were resistant in up to 5 liquid H2O2(2).Acinetobacter radioresistens 50v1 was isolated from the surface of the Mars Odyssey orbiter ( 3). Vegetative cells of this organism were capable of surviving a combination of stressors, including desiccation,up to 1,000 J of UV 254radiation, and up to 0.33 mgml of H2O2(3).Acinetobacter proteolyticus strain 2P01AA was isolated from the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at KSC during the assembly of the Phoenix spacecraft ( 4). As reported previously, strain 2P01AA exhibited increased resistance to H2O2exposure and survival in up to 320 mM H2O2(5). Here, we report the rst draft genome sequences of B. horneckiae type strain 1P01SC, B. nealsonii type strain FO-92, and two Acinetobacter species strains, 50v1, and 2P01AA, isolated from spacecraft hardware and associated surfaces. Strains 1P01SCT, FO-92T, 50v1, and 2P01AA, were sequenced using a shotgun sequencing approach on the Illumina HiSeq paired-end platform. The reads were de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench version 10.1.1, resulting in total genome sizes of 5,500,894 bp, 4,699,376 bp, 3,174,402 bp, and 4,328,804 bp, respec-tively. Genome statistics are given in Table 1 for all the strains. Annotations were produced using both the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology server ( 6) and the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline ( 7,8) and visualized using the SEED viewer ( 9). The Bacillus strains 1P01SCTand FO-92Thad 103 and 99 putative genes coding for dormancy and sporulation, respectively. Both strains had MutS, RecA, MutL, excinu-clease ABC, beta-lactamase, and genes coding for the formation of persister cells( 10). Strain FO-92Thad a prophage-associated DNA repair protein (RecT), six genes associated with spore DNA protection, exodeoxyribonuclease III, and a peroxide stressregulator (PerR). Strain 1P01SC Thad cold shock proteins (CspD and CspA) and a heat-inducible transcriptional repressor (HrcA). Acinetobacter strains 50v1 and 2P01AA possessed putative genes coding for per- sister cell formation, heat shock and cold shock responses, superoxide dismutase,Received 18 December 2017 Accepted 21 December 2017 Published 8 February 2018 Citation Seuylemezian A, Vaishampayan P, Cooper K, Venkateswaran K. 2018.

Strain 2P01AA had putative genes coding for heme oxygenase (HemO) and four genescoding for quorum-sensing molecules, which initiate biolm biosynthesis and adhesion( 12). Strain 50v1 had genes associated with betaine and choline uptake, which further allow for increased water retention in the cells ( 13), as well as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C and a DNA-binding protein (Dps), which has been shown toprotect organisms from oxidative stress ( 14). Accession number(s). The genome sequences of all four isolates have been de- posited at DDBLEMBLGenBank under the accession numbers listed in Table 1 .
