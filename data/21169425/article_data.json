Furthermore, this research eld allows the unveiling of novel connectionsbetween low-uid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterialvirulence. This study is the rst to characterize the spaceight-induced global transcriptional and proteomicresponses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceight-grownSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the rst spaceight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceight were the lecA andlecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase ( rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Inter-esting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation andoxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic me- tabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrication was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression inresponse to spaceight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during space-ight missions and for the general public. The microgravity environment associated with spaceight is unique and has a profound effect on both host and pathogencells, with potential implications for infectious disease. Fromthe host point of view, astronauts experience a compromisedimmune response under spaceight conditions, as reected incellular alterations of both the innate and adaptive immunesystems (23, 26, 40). Spaceight has been shown to alter theresponse of monocytes, isolated from astronauts preight andin ight, to Gram-negative toxins (27). Further, simulation ofaspects of this microgravity-associated decreased immune re-sponse, using the hind limb unloaded mouse model, showed anenhanced susceptibility of these animals to bacterial infection(3, 6). From the pathogens perspective, bacterial obligate andopportunistic pathogens have been found to exhibit enhancedstress resistance phenotypes following growth under both truespaceight and microgravity analogue conditions (13, 30, 33,4649). In response to the spaceight environment, global transcriptional and proteomic changes were observed for theenteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in the complex medium Lennox L broth base (LB),which were associated with an increased virulence in a murinemodel of infection (46). Moreover, the small RNA bindingprotein Hfq was identied as a major transcriptional regulatorofS.Typhimurium responses to the spaceight environment. A subsequent study demonstrated that cultivation of S.Typhi- murium in M9 minimal medium abolished the spaceight-induced virulence (47). While M9 spaceight cultures of S. Typhimurium exhibited virulence characteristics dramaticallydifferent from those in LB, microarray and proteomic analyses revealed a role for Hfq in both the M9 and LB spaceightstimulons (47). Complementary experiments using the rotatingwall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, in which cells are cultured in amicrogravity analogue low-uid-shear environment (i.e., low-shear modeled microgravity LSMMG), identied that a lowphosphate concentration in LB could be the origin of thespaceight-induced virulence of S.Typhimurium (47). Inter- estingly, LSMMG and spaceight induced similar increased  Corresponding author.

Thelatter indicates that molecular and phenotypic similarities be-tween LSMMG and spaceight conditions could be attributedto the analogous low-uid-shear environment. Recently, the global transcriptional response of the oppor- tunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to LSMMG was determined (13). As a ubiquitous organism colonizing bothenvironmental niches and the human body, P. aeruginosa is found in spacecrafts and has previously caused infections inastronauts (8, 24, 35, 43). Cultivation of P. aeruginosa in the LSMMG environment of the RWV induced molecular path-ways known to be of importance for virulence, compared tocontrol conditions. In agreement with the microarray data, anincreased production of the exopolysaccharide alginate, en-hanced resistance to heat and oxidative stress, and a decreasedoxygen transfer rate were observed. The alternative sigma fac-tor AlgU and Hfq were both proposed as important mediatorsof the LSMMG response in P. aeruginosa . In addition, by comparing the behavior of P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG to that in a higher-uid-shear control at body temperature,clinically relevant traits were found to be induced, such asbiolm formation, rhamnolipid production, and the C 4-homo - serine lactone quorum sensing system (12). Collectively, thesedata indicate that low uid shear has an impact on the behav-ior, and possibly on the pathogenicity, of P. aeruginosa . Importantly, low-uid-shear zones are believed to be en- countered by pathogens during their natural course of infec-tion in vivo , including in the intestinal, respiratory, and uro- genital tracts (12, 34). Therefore, in addition to the importanceof spaceight research for the evaluation of infectious diseaserisk during long-term missions, this research eld has the po-tential to provide novel insights in the role of uid shear invirulence and the disease process. This study describes the global transcriptional and transla- tional responses of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to the microgravity environment of spaceight. Our aim was to assess whether themicrogravity environment of spaceight could induce virulencetraits in P. aeruginosa and if evolutionarily conserved pathways in common with those of spaceight-grown S.Typhimurium were regulated in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the space-ight (this study) and LSMMG (13) responses of P. aeruginosa were compared and revealed interesting similarities. In addi-tion to the role of low uid shear in these observations, thepossible involvement of the adopted experimental setup is dis-cussed. The present study is the rst to assess the molecularresponse of an important opportunistic pathogen followinggrowth under actual spaceight conditions and provides im-portant insights into the evaluation and, eventually, the pre-vention of P. aeruginosa infections during spaceight missions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strain and growth media. A derivative of the wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ATCC 15692), which contained a gentamicin resistance cassette in theattB site, was used for the spaceight experiment. The gentamicin-resistant strain was constructed through homologous recombination as described previously(38). P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown in LB medium containing 25 H9262gml genta- micin in the spaceight hardware (see below) to avoid growth of any contami-nants. The bacterial inoculum (1.5 H1100310 8CFUml) in the spaceight hardware was suspended in 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and re-mained viable but static (not growing) during launch and until 9 days into the ight. After this time, growth was initiated by the addition of LB as describedbelow. Cells were xed in ight using the RNA and protein xative RNA LaterII (Ambion). At 2.5 h after landing of the space shuttle at the Kennedy SpaceCenter (KSC), samples were recovered and subsequently used for whole-genometranscriptional microarray and proteomic analyses. In each case, the ight cul-ture samples were compared with synchronous culture samples grown underidentical conditions on the ground at KSC using coordinated activation andtermination times (by means of real-time communications with the shuttleastronauts) in an insulated room that maintained temperature and humiditylevels identical to those on the shuttle (orbital environment simulator). Experimental setup adopted for spaceight culturing. Growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was initiated in ight, and cells were cultured in space and on the groundin specialized hardware termed the uid-processing apparatus (FPA) as de-scribed previously (46, 47) (Fig. 1). Briey, FPAs are glass barrels, containing abevel on the side, in which rubber stoppers are inserted for compartmentaliza-tion. The bottom stopper contained a gas exchange membrane. Glass barrels andrubber stoppers were coated with a silicone lubricant (Sigmacote; Sigma) andautoclaved separately before assembly. The subsequent insertion of rubber stop-pers into the FPAs resulted in the creation of three separate compartmentswhich contained, from top to bottom, (i) RNA Later II xative (2.5 ml), (ii)bacteria suspended in PBS (0.5 ml), and (iii) LB culture medium (2 ml). The lastcompartment was created at the level of the bevel. Each FPA was loaded into alexan sheet that contained a gas-permeable membrane at the bottom, and eightFPAs were subsequently loaded into larger containers, termed group activationpacks (GAPs). This experimental setup created a triple level of containment forcrew safety. At specic time points in ight, an astronaut manually inserted ahand crank into the end of the GAP and turned it, which pushed down on apressure plate underneath, resulting in a plunging action on the rubber stoppersof each FPA. This plunging action, which allowed for mixing of uids betweendifferent compartments through the bevel, was performed twice in ight. Therst plunging action, referred to as activation, served to add LB growth mediumto the cells, and the second (following a 25-h growth period) added xative topreserve samples for gene expression analysis. All phases of the experiment onorbit were conducted at ambient temperature (23C). Shuttle landing occurred atapproximately 58 h postxation. RNA extraction, labeling, and Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Total cellular RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) per themanufacturers instructions. Conversion to uorescently labeled cDNA, hybrid-ization to Affymetrix GeneChip arrays, and image acquisition were performed aspreviously described (29). Raw Affymetrix data were normalized and processedutilizing tools identical to those for the study of P. aeruginosa PAO1 under microgravity analogue conditions (13). The Benjamini-Hochberg method wasused for multiple-testing correction (7). Only fold change ratios with Pvalues below 0.05 (corrected for multiple testing) were considered statistically signi-cant. Microarray analysis was performed on all three biological replicates. Protein identication analysis. Proteins from spaceight and ground cell ly- sates were precipitated with acetone and subjected to multidimensional proteinidentication technology (MudPIT) analysis using the tandem mass spectrome-try (MS)-dual nano-liquid chromatography technique (11, 37). Tandem massspectra of peptides were analyzed with TurboSEQUEST version 3.1 (18) andXTandem (14) software. Data were further processed and organized using theScaffold program. A probability threshold of 90 was adopted, and only proteinspresent in at least two biological replicates were considered expressed. Spectrawere also assessed for good quality based on TurboSEQUEST correlation andDeltaCorrelation scores as previously described (11). Biostatistics. To calculate the overlap of up- and downregulated genes be- tween P. aeruginosa and S.Typhimurium under spaceight and simulated mi- crogravity culture conditions, homology was determined using the BLAST soft-ware (blastp) (1). Genes in different organisms were dened as orthologues whenthey fullled the following criteria: (i) a cutoff on the BLAST E value of 1e H1100210, (ii) a minimal alignment coverage of 80 of the shortest DNA or proteinsequence, (iii) a minimal sequence identity of 35, and (iv) appearance as eachothers reciprocal best BLAST hit. The statistical signicance of the number ofoverlapping genes between different species and conditions was determinedusing the hypergeometric distribution method (20).

APPL.ENVIRON .M ICROBIOL .RESULTS P. aeruginosa PAO1 transcriptome and proteome in re- sponse to spaceight. (i) General observations. Transcrip- tional analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown and xed under spaceight conditions revealed the induction of 52 genes andthe downregulation of 115 genes (2-fold threshold; PH110210.05) compared to those in identical synchronous ground controlsamples (Table 1). The genes that were differentially regulatedunder spaceight conditions were distributed throughout theP. aeruginosa PAO1 genome and were often adjacent, indicat- ing organization in transcriptional units (operons). Based onfunctional classication of differentially expressed genes usingthe Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (25),several categories were signicantly ( PH110210.05) overrepre- sented in either the up- or downregulated gene group. Thefunctional category that was signicantly more representedunder spaceight conditions was nitrogen metabolism, whiledownregulated gene categories comprised purine and pyrimi-dine metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphory-lation, and ribosome synthesis. By means of MudPIT analysis, 40 proteins were identied in ground and spaceight samples (present in at least two repli-cates), among which 28 were differentially expressed (Table 2).Seven of these 28 proteins were also differentially regulated atthe transcriptional level. (ii) Hfq and the Hfq regulon. The gene encoding the RNA binding protein Hfq and genes under the control of Hfq weredifferentially expressed under spaceight conditions. Morespecically, 13.4 of the genes from the previously described Hfq regulon (42) were induced (17 of 38 genes) or downregu-lated (21 of 38 genes) in response to spaceight, accounting for23 of the P. aeruginosa spaceight stimulon. The overlap between the spaceight data set and the Hfq regulon wassignicant ( PH110210.05), indicating that this transcriptional reg- ulator, at least in part, mediated the spaceight response of P. aeruginosa . While the downregulation of Hfq under spaceight conditions presumably resulted in the downregulation of genesunder positive control of Hfq (such as sigX,adk, and fabA ) and the upregulation of genes under negative control of Hfq (suchasbkdA2 ,bdhA , and glcC), other genes showed a direction of fold change opposite to what would be expected based uponthe described Hfq regulon. Examples include the upregulationofnirS,chiC , and rhlA, which have been documented to be under positive control of Hfq under conventional culture con- ditions (42). This nding indicates that other (post)transcrip-tional or posttranslational regulators (or regulatory networks)may have played a role in the differential expression of thesegenes in the microgravity environment of spaceight. Addi-tionally, three proteins whose mRNA expression levels arecontrolled by Hfq (i.e., PA0070, PA0456, and PA1555) werefound to be differentially expressed at the proteomic level. (iii) Anaerobic metabolism. The majority of genes that were upregulated under spaceight conditions (60) were associ-ated with growth under anaerobic conditions (Table 1) (19).Furthermore, 13 of the genes that were downregulated inspaceight are known to be downregulated during anaerobic FIG. 1. Diagram of a uid-processing apparatus (FPA) used as hardware for the spaceight experiment. In the preactivation setting of the FPA (setting 1), the bacterial inoculum (suspended in PBS) is separated from the culture medium and xative agent (RNA Later II) through rubberstoppers. The FPAs are brought on board the shuttle in their preactivation setting until activation in low-Earth orbit. Upon activation in ight(setting 2), the plunger is pushed downwards in order to bring the bacteria in contact with the medium, allowing for bacterial growth; the plungeris pushed until the middle stopper is located at the top part of the bevel. After 25 h of bacterial growth (setting 3), the plunger is pushed againin order to bring the middle stopper below the top part of the bevel, which brings the xative in contact with the bacterial culture.V OL. 77, 2011 RESPONSE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA TO SPACEFLIGHT 1223TABLE 1.

Only afew genes which are typically induced under microaerophilicgrowth conditions (2) (i.e., PA4306, PA4352, rhlI, and PA1123) were differentially expressed in spaceight compared to syn-chronous ground controls. Remarkably, genes involved indenitrication were among those with the highest fold induc-tions within this category. While genes encoding the nitratereductase were not induced signicantly, the mRNAs of genesencoding nitrite ( nirMS ), nitric oxide ( norBC ), and nitrous oxide reductases ( nosRZ ) were more abundant in spaceight- grown P. aeruginosa PAO1. Proteomic analysis of the P. aeruginosa cells grown in space- ight revealed that 7 of the 28 differentially expressed proteinsplay a role in anaerobic growth. The downregulation of ArcA,an enzyme involved in the fermentation of arginine, was ob-served, as well as the downregulation of CcoP2 (PA1555) (10),a cytochrome with high afnity for oxygen. The latter is typi-cally induced under microaerophilic conditions but not in theanaerobic mode of growth of P. aeruginosa (2). (iv) Virulence factors. The transcripts of several genes en- coding known P. aeruginosa PAO1 virulence factors were in- duced in spaceight samples compared to the ground controls.Among others, the genes encoding the lectins PA-I and PA-IIL (lecA andlecB, respectively), the chitinase-encoding gene chiC , and the rhamnolipid-encoding gene rhlA were signicantly in- duced. The lecA gene showed the highest fold induction in the gene list (6.3-fold). On the other hand, downregulation ofgenes encoding heat shock proteins ( groES and hslU ) and the N-butanoyl- L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) synthase ( rhlI) was observed. As mentioned above, hfq, which is a transcrip- tional regulator involved in the virulence of P. aeruginosa , was downregulated during spaceight. (v) Other functional categories. Of 115 genes that were downregulated under spaceight conditions, 40 are involved inthe synthesis of ribosomes. Genes involved in the dehydroge-nation of succinate to fumarate (i.e., sdhBCD ) and ATP syn- thesis ( atpGH ) were less expressed in spaceight-grown P. aeruginosa PAO1. Comparative bioinformatic analysis of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S.Typhimurium spaceight stimulons. In order to compare the gene expression proles of P. aeruginosa (this study) and S.Typhimurium (46) following exposure to space- ight conditions, orthologues of P. aeruginosa genes were iden- tied in the S.Typhimurium genome. Of 167 differentially expressed genes in P. aeruginosa , 102 orthologues were iden- tied in S.Typhimurium, among which 92 (of 115) belonged to the downregulated group and 10 (of 52) belonged to the up-regulated gene list.TABLE 1 Continued Gene no.Gene nameFunctionFold change, spacegroundHfqaO2a PA4569 ispB Octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase 0.49 H11003 PA4602 glyA3 Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 0.40 PA4608 PA4608 Hypothetical protein 2.11PA4610 PA4610 Hypothetical protein 2.70 H11003 PA4633 PA4633 Probable chemotaxis transducer 2.03 H11003 PA4671 PA4671 50S ribosomal protein L25 0.37PA4692 PA4692 Hypothetical protein 2.02PA4702 PA4702 Hypothetical protein 3.56PA4739 PA4739 Hypothetical protein 0.49 H11003H11003 PA4740 pnp Polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 0.43 PA4743 rbfA Ribosome binding factor A 0.48 PA4847 accB Biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) 0.38 PA4848 accC Biotin carboxylase 0.46 PA4880 PA4880 Probable bacterioferritin 0.46 H11003 PA4935 rpsF 30S ribosomal protein S6 0.48 PA4944 hfq RNA binding protein Hfq 0.48 PA5049 rpmE 50S ribosomal protein L31 0.28 PA5054 hslU ATP-dependent protease ATP-binding subunit 0.49 PA5067 hisE Phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphatase 0.49 PA5069 tatB Sec-independent translocase 0.35 PA5078 PA5078 Hypothetical protein 0.45PA5117 typA Regulatory protein TypA 0.44 PA5128 secB Export protein SecB 0.45 PA5276 lppL Lipopeptide LppL precursor 0.35 PA5316 rpmB 50S ribosomal protein L28 0.27 PA5355 glcD Glycolate oxidase subunit GlcD 2.51 H11003 PA5460 PA5460 Hypothetical protein 2.21 H11003 PA5490 cc4 Cytochrome c 4precursor 0.47 PA5491 PA5491 Probable cytochrome 0.35 H11003 PA5555 atpG ATP synthase subunit C 0.33 PA5557 atpH ATP synthase subunit D 0.45 PA5569 rnpA RNase P 0.41 PA5570 rpmH 50S ribosomal protein L34 0.22 aGenes that are part of the Hfq regulon or involved in anaerobicmicroaerophilic metabolism are indicated with  H11003(nH110053;PH110210.05; fold change, H113502.1226 CRABBE ET AL. APPL.ENVIRON .M ICROBIOL .A signicant overlap was found for the downregulated genes of the two bacteria ( PH110210.05) (Table 3). More specically, 15 genes showed a common lower transcription in the spaceightsamples and in the synchronous ground controls, among which9 encoded ribosomal subunits. Interestingly, hfqandbfrB (en-coding bacterioferritin) were part of the overlapping genes and were identied as key role players in both the spaceight- andLSMMG-induced responses of S.Typhimurium (46, 49). De- spite the observation that the overlap between spaceight-grown P. aeruginosa and S.Typhimurium was signicant, it is rather limited. Indeed, only 16 of the S.Typhimurium or- thologues in P. aeruginosa were found to be commonly down- regulated between the two bacteria. No overlap could be iden-tied for the upregulated genes of P. aeruginosa and S. Typhimurium under spaceight conditions. This is presumablybecause, in part, of the low presence of P. aeruginosa ortho- logues (for the upregulated genes) in the S.Typhimurium genome and because fewer genes were upregulated in re-sponse to spaceight for both of these organisms. Comparative bioinformatic analysis of the P. aeruginosa spaceight and LSMMG stimulons. A small, but signicant (PH110210.05), overlap of genes commonly upregulated in space- ight- and LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa was identied. These genes encode the hypothetical protein PA0534, a protein in-volved in microaerophilicanaerobic metabolism (PA0200), theATP binding protease component ClpA, and a hypotheticalprotein belonging to the Hfq regulon (PA2753). On the otherhand, 35 genes that were found to be upregulated in LSMMGwere downregulated under spaceight conditions. The major-ity of these genes (27 of 35) could be categorized as beinginvolved in the synthesis of ribosomes. Additionally, genesencoding citric acid cycle proteins ( sdhB , PA2634), bacterio- ferritin ( bfrB), a translational elongation factor ( fusA1 ), a heat shock protein (HslU), the sigma factor RpoA, a hypotheticalprotein (PA0856), and a protein involved in glycolysis(PA3001) were downregulated in response to spaceight cul-ture but upregulated in LSMMG. In our previous study (13), LSMMG was found to induce several genes encoding hypothetical proteins in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Among these, only one hypothetical protein (i.e.,PA2737) had not been reported as being differentially regu-lated under any studied condition and was proposed as poten-tially specic to the low-uid-shear conditions of LSMMG.TABLE 2.

DISCUSSION Assessing the behavior and virulence potential of obligate and opportunistic pathogens aboard spacecraft and the Inter-national Space Station (ISS) is of central importance to eval-uate the risk for infectious disease in the context of long-termmanned missions. Furthermore, since bacteria encounter mi-crogravity analogue low-uid-shear forces in the host duringtheir natural course of infection, bacterial spaceight researchcan provide novel insights into the in vivo infection process. Indeed, spaceight increased the virulence of S.Typhimurium, while global gene expression proling revealed a generaldownregulation of key virulence genes in this pathogen (46,47). The present study demonstrated for the rst time that theopportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa responded to culture in the microgravity environment of spaceight through differen-tial regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins. A signicant partof the spaceight stimulon was under the control of the RNAbinding protein Hfq. Hfq is important for the virulence andstress resistance of several (opportunistic) pathogens, includ-ingP. aeruginosa PAO1 (17, 39, 41), by modulating the func- tion and stability of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and in-terfering with their interactions with mRNAs (reviewed inreferences 31 and 44). Interestingly, Hfq was also found to bean important regulator in the responses of (i) P. aeruginosa to microgravity analogue low-uid-shear conditions (LSMMG,using the RWV bioreactor) and (ii) S.Typhimurium to actual spaceight and LSMMG conditions (13, 46, 49). Hence, Hfq isthe rst transcriptional regulator ever shown to be commonlyinvolved in the spaceight and LSMMG responses of two bac-terial species. Among the P. aeruginosa genes with the highest fold induc- tions under spaceight conditions were the genes encoding thelectins LecA and LecB. Lectins bind galactosides, play a role inthe bacterial adhesion process to eukaryotic cells, and are thusimportant virulence factors in P. aeruginosa (21, 22). P. aerugi- nosa lectins have cytotoxic effects in human peripheral lym- phocytes and respiratory epithelial cells in vitro and increase alveolar barrier permeability in vivo (4, 9). Lectin production in P. aeruginosa is regulated through the N-butanoyl- L-homo- serine lactone (C4-HSL) quorum-sensing system (50), which has been previously reviewed (45). However, the downregula- tion of rhlI, the gene encoding the C4-HSL synthase, under spaceight conditions was unexpected. Nevertheless, rhlA, which is dependent on C4-HSL quorum-sensing regulation and encodes the rhamnosyltransferase I involved in rhamnolipid surfactant biosynthesis, was induced during spaceight culture.Rhamnolipids are glycolipidic surface-active molecules thathave cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects in eukaryoticcells (5, 15, 32, 36). Interestingly, rhamnolipids and rhlA tran- scripts were also found in P. aeruginosa in larger amounts under low-uid-shear compared to higher-uid-shear growthconditions, using the RWV bioreactor (12). These data indi-cate that rhamnolipid production could be induced upon sens-ing of low uid shear. Gene expression proles of P. aeruginosa grown under spaceight conditions also revealed the differential regulationof a signicant fraction of genes involved in growth under oxygen-limiting conditions. Spaceight induced mainly genesinvolved in anaerobic metabolism, which was reinforced by alower expression in spaceight samples of CcoP2, a cyto-chrome with high afnity for oxygen that is typically inducedunder microaerophilic conditions (2, 10). At the time of mea-surement, the most prominent way to cope with the apparentoxygen shortage under spaceight conditions seemed to occurthrough denitrication and not through fermentation. Indeed,under oxygen-limiting conditions, P. aeruginosa switches to an- aerobic respiration in the presence of the alternative electronacceptor nitrate or nitrite (16). The downregulation of ArcA, aprotein involved in arginine fermentation, accentuates thatfermentation was presumably not activated in spaceight-grown bacteria. When comparing the gene expression proles of P. aerugi- nosa grown in spaceight and P. aeruginosa grown in LSMMG, a limited but signicant overlap was found. Besides the role ofHfq and its regulon in the response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to both spaceight and LSMMG (see above), a signicant frac-tion of genes involved in both microaerophilic and anaerobicmetabolism were commonly induced. In contrast to P. aerugi- nosa grown under spaceight conditions, LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa induced genes involved in arginine and pyruvate fermentation, while denitrication did not appear to play a rolein the LSMMG response of this bacterium. The observationthat spaceight samples were presumably more deprived ofoxygen than LSMMG-grown bacteria, compared to their re-spective controls, could be explained by the fact that actualspaceight conditions are characterized by even lower uidshear levels than LSMMG conditions. Indeed, due to the ab-sence of convection currents in microgravity, oxygen limitationwill be more pronounced in space than in LSMMG. Further-more, the role of the experimental setup needs to be consid-ered. As depicted in Fig. 2, cells grown in the bioreactors usedfor growth of P. aeruginosa in LSMMG and spaceight have different oxygen availabilities. While the bioreactors have agas-permeable membrane, the membrane surface-to-volumeratio of FPA bioreactors (used in spaceight) is 12 times lowerthan that of the RWVs (LSMMG) based on the formulaH9266r 2(H9266r2H11003h)o r1  h, with rH11005radius and hH11005height. Hence, oxygen availability overall will be higher in RWVs than in the FPA devices. It also needs to be mentioned that despite dif-ferences in aeration and uid shear between the spaceightand LSMMG studies, the RWV mimics only certain aspects ofthe spaceight environment. Indeed, enhanced irradiation andvibration or potential direct effects of microgravity (such aseffects on the cell or cellular components instead of on theextracellular environment) during spaceight could lead todifferences in gene and protein expression proles betweenspaceight and LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa . Accordingly, the RWV bioreactor was unable to mimic the complete repertoireof spaceight-induced alterations in P. aeruginosa . Since the present study was conducted by growing P. aerugi- nosa in a liquid environment under spaceight conditions, our results are relevant mainly to the assessment of bacterial vir-ulence in uid niches of the spacecraft. Indeed, astronauts arein regular contact with water-containing sources that could becontaminated with P. aeruginosa , such as drinking water, rinseless shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash, and water for laun-1228 CRABBE ET AL. APPL.ENVIRON .M ICROBIOL .dry. Similarly, water-related sites in the hospital environment are most likely to harbor P. aeruginosa (e.g., faucets, showers, medication, disinfectants, mouthwash, and other hygiene prod-ucts) and are at the origin of a signicant number of nosoco-mial infections (28). Furthermore, P. aeruginosa is occasionally part of the normal human ora of the mouth, pharynx, anteriorurethra, and lower gastrointestinal tract. In these regions of thehuman body, P. aeruginosa is present in a uid environment, which will be affected by microgravity and will presumablyresult in the exposure of P. aeruginosa to lower-uid-shear conditions than on Earth. This study was the rst to characterize the comprehensive transcriptional and translational responses of an opportunisticpathogen that is frequently found in the space habitat. Wedemonstrated that spaceight conditions activated pathways inP. aeruginosa that have been shown previously to be involved inthein vivo infection process. However, the regulation of sev- eral of these pathways appears to be differentially controlledduring spaceight compared to conventional culture. Hfq wasput forward as a main transcriptional regulator in the space-ight response of P. aeruginosa , therefore representing the rst transcriptional regulator commonly involved in the spaceightresponses of different bacterial species. We also identied in-teresting similarities and differences between P. aeruginosa grown in spaceight and under the LSMMG conditions of theRWV. Despite the limited overlap of identical genes betweenspaceight- and LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa , it was observed that different genes of the same regulon or stimulon could beinduced or downregulated in spaceight and LSMMG. Theexperimental setup was proposed as one of the putative factorsat the origin of the oxygen-related transcriptional differencesbetween LSMMG culture in the RWV bioreactor and space-ight-cultured P. aeruginosa in the FPAs. These data empha- size the importance of using identical hardware for spaceightexperiments and ground simulations, especially when oxygen isa limiting factor. In addition, differences in uid shear andother environmental conditions (such as irradiation) betweenactual microgravity and LSMMG need to be considered whencomparing bacterial responses to the two test conditions. Thisstudy represents an important step in understanding the re-sponse of bacterial opportunistic pathogens to the uniquespaceight environment. Furthermore, it allows assessment ofthe role that low-uid-shear regions found in the human bodyplay in the regulation of bacterial virulence. It remains to bedetermined whether the phenotype of P. aeruginosa acquired under spaceight conditions will effectively lead to increasedpathogenicity, as was observed for S.Typhimurium. This will be an important consideration and key area of future study inorder to further assess the risk for infectious disease duringlong-term missions.
