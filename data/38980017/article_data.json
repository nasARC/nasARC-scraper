ABSTRACT In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments.

IMPORTANCE The genetic model organism C. elegans has recently emerged as a tool for understanding hostmicrobiome interactions.

KEYWORDS Caenorhabditis elegans , skin microbiota, microbiome, 16S RNA All animals are in contact with microbial communities, termed the microbiome. Microbiomes play a significant role in shaping host physiology, adaptation, fitness, and even behavior ( 14). Organisms and their microbial inhabitants share their first interactions at the integument of the host ( 5). This enveloping layer, whether it be skin, membranes, or a cuticle, plays an essential role in hostmicrobe relationships and may act as a barrier to promote host survival. These essential roles coupled with dynamic microbial communities provide a valuable interface to study hostmicrobe interactions (6). Emerging studies specifically focus on the effects of single, pathogenic bacteria, which are often localized to the gut, on animal behavior and physiology ( 710).

This is an open- access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license .single-species studies allow a thorough investigation of hostmicrobe interactions, individual microbial species do not fully recapitulate entire communities of microbes ( 11). Moreover, a majority of these studies focus on pathogen invasion mechanisms of the skin or pathogencommensal microbial interactions ( 12), whereas hostcommensal dynamics at the skin surface remain impactful but understudied ( 5, 13). This is also the case for the soil- and fruit-dwelling nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans . Despite the subtle implication of surface-adherent bacteria, hostmicrobe interaction studies at the surface layer are often focused on pathogens ( 1416). In the wild, C. elegans are found in rotting organic matter filled with microorganisms ( 1719). Therefore, an interaction between external microbes and the worms integumentthe cuticleis inevitable and likely a dynamic process ( 20), Moreover, these nematodes rely on their cuticle health to protect against environmental stressors such as harmful toxins ( 21), desiccants ( 22), or pathogens ( 23, 24). The function of the C. elegans cuticle and its many structures have been explored using mutants in the underlying genes. Animals with defective cuticle structures display a number of phenotypes including motor abnormalities, a higher susceptibility to chemically induced cuticle degradation, and protection from skin pathogens ( 2528). Several modes of fungal and single-bacterial adherence and pathogenesis have been characterized ( 1416), including Leucobacter strains known to externally invade C. elegans surfaces ( 15, 29). However, interactions involving ecologically relevant commensals and, moreover, communities of microbes that represent wild C. elegans encounters remain underexplored. Nematodes are maintained on bacterial lawns in laboratory settings. Together with their genetic tools and transparent bodies, C. elegans have recently gained attention in microbiome studies ( 30, 31). In the laboratory setting, a single bacterium Escherichia coli (usually a single strain, OP50) serves as the animals food source and external environ ment and minimally colonizes the C. elegans intestine for most of its life ( 32). However, E. coli is not a substitute for a microbiome of C. elegans nor is it extensively associated with the nematode in the wild. A recent meta-analysis of the C. elegans intestinal microbiota produced a comprehensive analysis of the hosts natural gut inhabitants ( 1719). This collaborative effort prompted the creation of the C. elegans microbiome (CeMbio), a model microbiome consisting of the 12 most abundant gut bacteria families naturally associated with C. elegans (33). Individual isolates from this consortium are known to affect growth, food choice behavior, and physiology, as well neural degradation through metabolite secretion ( 3438). However, these studies only consider the influence and composition of CeMbio bacteria in the gut and have not examined their potential impact at other body sites, like the cuticle. In preparation for intestinal microbial sequencing, animals are traditionally subjected to harsh bleach washes and surface-sterilization protocols to remove cuticle-resident bacteria ( 39). Moreover, the first study using CeMbio intensified previously established washing steps to more effectively remove bacteria that were hypothesized to still remain on the surface, even after washing multiple times ( 33). The examination of nematode microbiomes in the absence of stringent surface bleach sterilization may provide worthwhile insights into the effects of a comprehensive, complex, and natural microbiome on cuticle physiology and host biology. To investigate the persistence, existence, and composition of a cuticle-resident microbiome, we develop a novel micro-swabbing tool in combination with bacterial growth curves to investigate if animals reared on a complex microbiome harbor cuticle-resident bacteria. To supplement this finding, we enumerate the abundance of bacteria on surface-sterilized animals to demonstrate that surface-sterilization protocols remove a significant number of skin-resident or associated bacteria. We then conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize a skin microbiome on animals reared on complex microbiomes similar to CeMbio, which we call modified CeMbio (mCeMbio, Table 1 ). Importantly, we find that the microbiome of non-sterilized C. elegans is microbially distinct from the microbiome of the C. elegans gut and the surrounding environment. We identify skin- and gut-dominant isolates of this microbial consortium Research Article Microbiology Spectrum August 2024 Volume 12 Issue 8 10.1128spectrum.00169-24 2that demonstrate distinct attachment strengths to the cuticle. Finally, we show that colonization with mCeMbio and with several mCeMbio isolates confers protection for the host against noxious stimuli. RESULTS A skin swab protocol reveals that abundant mCeMbio bacteria persist on the C. elegans surface We sought to directly identify the existence of a resident skin microbiome on the C. elegans cuticle. However, existing microbiological techniques on the nematode are designed to isolate the entirety of the animals microbiota rather than skin microbes. We postulated that the entire microbiota consists of gut-resident and surface-resident microbes and that these parts can be separated with varying intensities of surface-wash ing steps ( Fig. 1A ). For instance, surface-sterilization, hereafter referred to as bleach ing,  removes all skin bacteria and isolates gut-resident bacteria ( Fig. 1A ). Moreover, we hypothesize that animals with more skin-resident bacteria will demonstrate larger decreases in bacterial counts following bleaching. Using a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, we assessed the existence of surface-adherent microbes on animals reared on OP50 or mCeMbio. First, we observe greater CFUs from animals reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50 ( Fig. 1B ). We also observe no significant difference between the number of CFUs from whole animal lysates that were serially washed or bleached after being reared on OP50 (103 bacteria per worm, Fig. 1B ). However, we observe a significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (104 bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (106 bacteria per worm). From these data, we find that animals reared on mCeMbio, but not OP50, harbor skin-resident bacteria. Moreover, to account for free-living bacteria that are not in contact with the skin, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants after a series of washes. We observe that there are OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria present in the supernatant after washing three times, which might reflect transient gut or skin microbes that have been shed, and highlight the limited extent of these methods for identifying skin-resident microbes. Inspired by existing methods used to identify skin microbes on the surface of amphibians ( 4043), we created a microscopic nematode-sized skin swab. This reusable glass tool is swabbed across the length of each animal ( Fig. 1C ). To eliminate non- adherent, free-living microbes and enrich for putative skin-resident microbes, we compare unwashed animals (crawl) to animals that have been washed once or three times. As a negative control, we include animals that have been bleached. Swabs from animals reared on OP50 indicate that OP50 grows from lawns and unwashed animals, but even washing once eliminates all skin-associated OP50 bacteria ( Fig. 1D ; Fig. S1A and TABLE 1 Bacterial strains used in this study ID Genus Species Source JUb19 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio JUb44 Chryseobacterium scophthalmum mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio JUb101 Enterobacter sp. mCeMbio JUb134 Sphingomonas molluscorum mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio MYb10 Acinetobacter guillouiae mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio MYb11 Pseudomonas lurida mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio MYb71 Ochrobactrum pecoris mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio BIGb0170 Sphingobacterium multivorum mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio BIGb0172 Comamonas piscis mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio BIGb0393 Pantoea nemavictus mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio MSPm1 Pseudomonas mendocina mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio CEN2ent1 Enterobacter xiangfangensis mCeMbio, CGC CeMbio CBX151 Leucobacter celer subsp. astrifaciens Known skin bacterium OP50 Escherichia coli Standard foodResearch Article Microbiology Spectrum August 2024 Volume 12 Issue 8 10.1128spectrum.00169-24 3C). Specifically, growth curves of OP50 from singly (1X) and triply (3X) washed animals are indistinguishable from the swabs from bleached animals ( Fig. 1E ). Swabs from animals reared on mCeMbio indicate that viable bacteria can be isolated from lawns and unwashed animals as well as animals that have been washed up to three times ( Fig. 1F ; FIG 1 Colony Forming Unit (CFU) analysis and novel skin swab protocols reveal that abundant bacteria persist on the C. elegans surface (A) Diagram showing analysis of CFUs from washed animals, bleached animals, and liquid supernatants roughly estimates skin-resident bacterial abundance.

Growth curves of mCeMbio from animals washed up to three times had 7 fold higher levels of bacteria compared to bleached animals ( Fig. 1G ). These findings suggest that there are significant populations of adherent mCeMbio bacteria on the C. elegans cuticle that are removed by standard bleach-based surface-sterilization protocols. Surface sterilization alters the relative proportion of mCeMbio bacteria, suggesting distinct surface-resident communities We sought to define the species of mCeMbio bacteria that reside on the C. elegans cuticle and determine whether they are distinct from the microbiota of the gut and the surrounding environment. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on bleached C. elegans , serially washed C. elegans , and their bacterial lawns. In two separate experi ments, we discovered that the bacterial communities of bleached animals have a microbiota that is distinct from those of animals that have been serially washed. In bleached animals, we observed significantly higher levels of Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, while unbleached animals contain more Enterobacter sp . JUb101 and Sphingobacterium multivorum BIGb0170 ( Fig. 2A through C). Despite significant differences between the relative abundance of bacteria across experiments 1 and 2 (Fig. S2A through C), we observe consistent differences in micro biota composition of bleached and serially washed animals, both of which are distinct from bacterial lawns ( Fig. 2E and F ). These data suggest that bacterial communities of bleached animals are significantly different than those of serially washed animals, as evidenced by BrayCurtis distances (PERMANOVA, Fig. 2G and I ). Furthermore, within- sample alpha diversity, expressed as the Shannon index, of each treatment group is similar, but mCeMbio bacterial lawns display greater diversity than bleached or serially washed C. elegans in experiment 2 ( Fig. 2H and J ). Our data suggest that the composition of the C. elegans skin microbiome is stable over time; we observe that only one bacterial species shows a significant change in abundance between 2 and 8-day-old washed (unbleached) animals, while the microbiome composition between 2 and 8-day-old bleached animals shows reduction in only two species (Fig. S2D and E). Collectively, we suggest that the microbiota of C. elegans with an intact skin microbiota is distinct from the microbiota of the C. elegans gut and further distinct from the environment on which the animals were raised. Specifically, we hypothesize that species more abundant in bleached animals (JUb19 and MYb71) are more gut-specific, whereas species more abundant in serially washed animals (JUb101 and BIGb0170) are more skin-specific. Specific mCeMbio microbes associate with the C. elegans cuticle Informed by 16S relative abundance data, we sought to identify the effects of bleaching or serial washes on animals reared on JUb19 or JUb101. JUb101 is the only predomi nantly skin-resident microbe on which C. elegans develop at similar rates to those of OP50 and mCeMbio (( 33) and our observations), and JUb19 is the gut-resident microbe with the highest relative abundance ( Fig. 2C and D ). As in Fig. 1 , we performed CFU analysis on the microbes of interest in this study. We observe more CFUs from lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb101 (106 bacteria per worm) than lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb19 (105 bacteria per worm) ( Fig. 3A ). There is no statistically significant difference between the number of CFUs from lysates of serially washed or bleached animals reared on JUb19, although JUb19 is still found on the surface. This is indicated by 104 CFU per worm found in and on serially washed animals, compared to the 102 CFU per worm found in bleached animals ( Fig. 3A ). Conversely, in animals raised on JUb101, there is a statistically significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (102 bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (106 bacteria per worm), indicating the presence of JUb101 as a persistent and abundant skin-resident microbe that is removed with surface-sterilization protocols, but not serial washes ( Fig. 3A ). To account for free-living bacteria that are loosely attached to the cuticle or transient within Research Article Microbiology Spectrum August 2024 Volume 12 Issue 8 10.1128spectrum.00169-24 5the worm, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants following serial washes. We observe that JUb101 and JUb19 are both present in these supernatants, but in lower abundance when compared to washed groups. To directly compare JUb19 and JUb101 as putative gut and skin-resident microbes, respectively, we swabbed animals reared on JUb19, JUb101, or CBX151. We include CBX151 ( Leucobacter celer subsp. astrifaciens , Verde1) as a control bacterium that is known to strongly adhere to the C. elegans cuticle ( 44). We hypothesized that the FIG 2 Surface sterilization alters the relative proportion of mCeMbio bacteria.

As expected, swabs from animals reared on CBX151 grow regardless of the number of washes ( Fig. 3B ). After 72 hours of growth, no discernable differences between swabs from animals that were unwashed (crawl), washed once, or washed thrice after exposure to CBX151 were observed ( Fig. 3C ; Fig. S3A and B). Similarly, swabs from animals reared on JUb101 grow regardless of the number of washes ( Fig. 3D ). After 72 hours of growth, swabs from JUb101-reared animals that have been washed once are not distinct from those of unwashed JUb101-reared animals, but are distinct from those of bleached animals ( Fig. 3E ; Fig. S3C and D). Conversely, swabs from animals reared on JUb19 indicate that bacterial growth from unwashed crawl animals is distinct from animals washed once or thrice ( Fig. 3F and G ). Swabs from JUb19 animals washed once or thrice are indistinguishable from swabs of bleached animals ( Fig. 3G ; Fig. S3E and F). Together, the patterns observed in JUb101 growth curves resemble those of CBX151, suggesting that JUb101 is also likely a cuticle-resident microbe.

We hypothesized that bacteria associated with the cuticle (JUb101, BIGb0170, and CBX151 as a known skin-adherent control) would protect animals from noxious environments more than gut-associated ones (JUb19 and MYb71). To test this, we performed a cuticle resistance assay by treating animals with a harsh (5) bleach solution ( Fig. 4A ). In this assay, the time to burst is a readout of cuticle integrity and a potential indication of the protective roles that bacteria may have on worm physiology ( 45, 46). We found that wild-type animals reared on CBX151 and mCeMbio community take significantly longer to burst compared to OP50 controls and there fore exhibit greater cuticle resistance ( Fig. 4B ). Animals were also reared on mCeMbio isolates individually, and we observed a range of impacts on cuticle integrity. Some bacterial species, including gut-resident Ochrobactrum MYb71, significantly promoted cuticle integrity with longer times to burst. Other bacteria, including the skin-associ ated JUb101 and gut-associated JUb19, did not alter animal burst times compared to OP50. Sphingomonas JUb134 was the only mCeMbio strain to significantly decrease host cuticle integrity, further supporting that most mCeMbio strains are nonpathogenic in this context ( 33). However, neither JUb101 nor JUb19 consistently change C. elegans cuticle burst time on their own ( Fig. 4B ). This suggests that interspecies interactions present in mCeMbio may promote cuticle protection or the N2 wildtype C. elegans strain lacks sensitivity in this assay and masks the subtle impact on the cuticle. To test this, we assessed how these bacteria affect animals with disrupted cuticle structures, thereby sensitizing the assay. We tested animals with mutations in cuticle- related genes: bus-8, dpy-8, srf-3, and dpy-10 (Fig. S4A; Table S1). All genes are known to affect cuticle integrity. Bus-8 is predicted to encode a glycosyltransferase, enabling proper cuticle molts and leading to disordered epidermal morphogenesis in strong mutants ( 26, 45). Dpy-8 and dpy-10 are collagen genes that, upon disruption, cause loss of cuticular annuli structures ( 27). Srf-3 encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter, and mutants have altered cuticle surface compositions that confer biofilm resistance ( 28). Previous studies have demonstrated bus-8 (e2698 ) mutants as more sensitive ( 45) in the cuticle resistance assay, while dpy-10 mutants have been shown to be more stiff than wild-type animals ( 47) and express the innate immune gene nlp-29 at high levels constitutively ( 48), while also being more permeable to a Hoescht staining protocol ( 27), suggesting a multifaceted role for dpy-10 in protection and permeability. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared bus-8 mutants are significantly shorter (time to burst  25 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst  93 seconds), as previously observed in literature (45) (Fig. 4C and D ; Fig. S4A). Despite a disordered epidermal morphology and disrupted cuticle integrity in bus-8 animals, mCeMbio consistently promotes cuticle integrity (time to burst  39 seconds) compared to OP50 (time to burst  25 seconds) ( Fig. 4D ). To normalize across multiple experiments and variable times to burst, we evaluated the fold change in burst time compared to animals raised on OP50. We observed significant differences in the fold change in burst time of bus-8 animals raised on mCeMbio and JUb19 compared to animals raised on OP50, with mCeMbio providing 1.4-fold increases in burst time and JUb19 providing a 1.3-fold increase; JUb101 does not significantly increase the fold change in burst time but shows variability between experiments (Fig. S4B through D). Interestingly, the cuticle-adherent CBX151 caused either parental death or suppressed growth in bus-8 animals, preventing us from testing this condition consistently in this cuticle mutant background. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared dpy-10 mutants are significantly longer (time to burst  145 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst  93 seconds) ( Fig. 4C and E ). Dpy-10 animals raised on CBX151 (time to burst  457 seconds), mCeMbio (time to burst  302 seconds), JUb19 (time to burst  219 seconds), or JUb101 (time to burst  291 seconds) display noticeably longer cuticle burst times compared to dpy-10 animals raised on OP50 (time to burst  145 seconds) ( Fig. 4E). This relationship is consistent with the fold change over OP50 observed for animals Research Article Microbiology Spectrum August 2024 Volume 12 Issue 8 10.1128spectrum.00169-24 8raised on CBX151 (3.9-fold), mCeMbio (2.3-fold), JUb19 (1.9-fold), and JUb101 (2.2-fold) (Fig. S4D). Given the consistency of increased cuticle integrity in both wild-type and cuticle mutants reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50, bacteriabacteria interactions likely impact C. elegans bleach sensitivity. Moreover, dpy-10 mutants reared on JUb101 or JUb19 promote cuticle protection compared to OP50, unmasking a subtle yet consistent impact of these bacteria on the cuticle. Despite being a single species, CBX151 is also a consistent promoter of cuticle integrity, suggesting a role for adherence to cuticle structures still present on dpy-10 and bus-8 mutants. Interestingly, these cuticle structures may be critical for the adherence of some of the mCeMbio strains. We performed 16S sequencing on these sensitized strains to observe the composition of mCeMbio species present on the surfaces of the C. elegans mutants. We show the composition of serially washed (unbleached) bus-8, dpy-10 , dpy-8 , and srf-3 mutants compared to wild-type controls collected alongside them. We observe that bus-8, dpy-10 , dpy-8 , and srf-3 mutants all display reduced abundance of JUb101, the FIG 4 CBX151, mCeMbio, and some individual species protect wild-type and mutant C. elegans from harsh bleach solution ( A) Schematic of the bleach sensitivity assay using harsh bleach solution.

Moreover, bus-8, dpy-8 , and srf-3 mutants have increased abundance of JUb19, the putative gut-resident microbe in this study (Fig. S4E and F). These results allow us to begin to associate some cuticle structures with bacterial adherence. DISCUSSION Bacteriahost interactions are complex and known to impact many aspects of host biology. Consequently, the study of ecologically relevant bacterial communities is often traded for the simplicity of single species. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of ecologically relevant communities of bacteria and uncover a C. elegans skin-resident microbiome. We reared animals on a natural C. elegans microbiota, mCeMbio, and discovered that most of the mCeMbio bacteria can be removed by bleaching protocols, suggesting that these bacteria may reside on the cuticle surface ( Fig. 1A and B ). We observed that our surface-sterilized worm CFU counts match those in previous findings (33), whereas serially washed, unbleached worms have significantly more bacteria ( Fig. 1B and 3A ). We conjectured that there are abundant skin-resident bacteria, approximat ing counts from simplified arithmetic of  unbleached CFU   bleached CFU   supernatant CFU ( Fig. 1A ). To supplement this finding, we developed and implemented a novel micro-swab to isolate skin microbes from C. elegans cuticles. We measured the growth of swabbed OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria from C. elegans cuticles and observed distinct and repeatable patterns of relative growth between washing conditions ( Fig. 1D through G ); more washes are required to remove mCeMbio bacteria from the cuticle, implying that mCeMbio contains surface-adherent bacteria. We then conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing to define strain-level microbial differences among serially washed and bleached animals. From these data emerged candidate gut- ( Stenotrophomonas JUb19 and Ochrobactrum MYb71) and skin-domi nant bacteria ( Enterobacter JUb101 and Sphingobacterium BIGb0170). Although our two independent sequencing experiments revealed different proportions of microbes (Fig. S2A and C), both experiments suggest that there are distinct communities in animals with intact microbiomes compared to those without surface microbes ( Fig. 2C through J; Fig. S2B). Importantly, the microbiomes from animals with cuticle-adherent microbes are distinct from those of their bacterial lawns ( Fig. 2G and I ), indicating some level of selection on the surface of the cuticle. Although we cannot confirm whether the composition of the supernatant from washed animals, which is composed of loosely TABLE 2 All cuticle burst timesa Bacteria Set 1 Set 2 Set 3 Set 4 Set 5 Set 6 N2 OP50 93  35 81  28 67  31 121  38 265  112 112  30 CBX151 212  34 243  67 269  45 220  28 NAbNA mCeMbio 212  122 322  194 354  100 346  132 NA NA JUb19 193  43 129  47 124  42 81  41 NA NA JUb101 143  32 NA NA NA 218  49 187  100 bus-8 OP50 25  4 29  3 28  3 32  5 30  7 30  6 CBX151 Unable to test mCeMbio 39  10 37  8 38  7 50  21 NA NA JUb19 34  11 42  5 31  4 39  11 NA NA JUb101 32  5 NA NA NA 34  11 26  4 dpy-10 OP50 145  66 151  105 178  117 90  48 242  159 193  123 CBX151 409  157 481  141 541  86 486  143 NA NA mCeMbio 303  132 242  51 216  141 396  117 NA NA JUb19 297  126 143  82 289  158 296  139 NA NA JUb101 280  102 NA NA NA 504  193 391  176 aAverage time to cuticle burst for nine animals from each genotype (N2, bus-8, and dpy-10 ) raised on OP50, CBX151, mCeMbio, JUb19, or JUb101.

We further confirmed the persistence of skin-resident microbes compared to more gut-resident microbes by measuring bacterial growth from skin swabs of animals reared on these species ( Fig. 3D through G ). We hypothesize that multiple species within mCeMbio may also associate with the C. elegans cuticle to varying degrees. None of the mCeMbio bacteria are known to be pathogenic, although the individ ual isolates demonstrate varying effects on host developmental rates ( 33). Given the symbiotic nature of these bacteria and our parallel lines of validation of surface-adher ent bacteria, we hypothesized that the mCeMbio community serves a role in cuticle protection against environmental stressors. We conducted a well-established cuticle fragility assay and observed the consistent role of mCeMbio and CBX151, a known cuticle-adherent bacterium, to promote cuticle integrity in the host, which varies across the individual bacterial species in mCeMbio ( Fig. 4A and B ). From these data, we demonstrate the importance of studying community effects and the effects of single bacterial species on cuticle integrity. Put together, we uncover a protective effect for animals reared on a consortium of ecologically relevant bacteria. The data from our study do not differentiate between the combinatorial effects of the mCeMbio bacteria on the skin and in the gut, and the mechanism of this protection requires further examination. Several species of bacteria found in association with C. elegans are known to, directly and indirectly, protect against pathogens in the worm intestine ( 49). Other protective benefits may be derived from diverse nutritional or metabolic mechanisms unique to the mCeMbio bacteria ( 33). This may provide an indirect mechanism by which gut-dominant bacteria, like MYb71, are able to protect the cuticle. Moreover, both known skin-resident bacteria and members of the mCeM bio consortium have been shown to prime the cuticle against other infections ( 50). This protection may even be attributed to the potential hydrogen peroxide-degrading capabilities of the mCeMbio consortium, which have been observed in strains of E. coli (51). Importantly, we sought to examine skin-enriched microbes and the mCeM bio consortium as a whole, which involves both bacteriabacteria and hostbacteria interactions. This is highlighted by greater cuticle resistance in animals raised on the mCeMbio community (time to burst  277 seconds) compared to all but one of the individual mCeMbio members, the gut-enriched strain Ochrobactrum MYb71 ( Fig. 4B ). This suggests that most single hostbacteria interactions may not fully recapitulate the extent of interactions in our system and demonstrates the importance of studying communities of ecologically relevant microbes. In an effort to develop C. elegans as a model for understanding skin and associated diseases, we must make use of sensitized and protective strains. To do this, we used C. elegans mutants with varying levels of disordered cuticle structure and function. We found that mCeMbio, JUb19, JUb101, as well as the known skin-adherent microbe CBX151 increase protection in nearly all sensitized and protective mutants ( Fig. 4C through E ; Fig. S4A through D; Table 2 ). However, we have not confirmed that these mutant animals can be vessels for bacterial growth on their skin, given their disrupted state. We see effects on these sensitized mutants and correlate those effects to the presence of skin microbes. It is also plausible that, similar to our findings in wild-type animals, these effects could be due to nutritional supplementation from mCeMbio bacteria or otherwise mediated through the gut. Interestingly, the washed (unbleached) C. elegans with mutations in cuticle genes display 16S profiles different from those of the washed (unbleached) wild-type animals. These differences are most starkly observed in the decreased abundance of putative skin-adherent microbe, JUb101, and increased presence of JUb19 across nearly all of the sensitized cuticle mutant strains. We do not have data for bleached cuticle mutant strains; due to their sensitized nature, the standard bleaching protocol was too harsh for most of the animals. Therefore, we are unable to compare between washed and bleached conditions. However, we observe that mCeMbio is able to rescue the cuticle Research Article Microbiology Spectrum August 2024 Volume 12 Issue 8 10.1128spectrum.00169-24 11mutants, which suggests that even small populations of the strains are protective or that the protection comes from aforementioned indirect influences. Given the symbiotic nature of the mCeMbio bacteria, which includes 1112 published CeMbio strains; unique cuticle structures of the nematode skin such as the annuli, alae, or invagination sites; and community effects on promoting barrier function, our data support the existence of and role for a previously unappreciated C. elegans skin microbiome. Our work supports the continued efforts to make the study of C. elegans more ecologically relevant and suggests that we continue to understand and increase environmental enrichment to improve the relevance of this model system. MATERIALS AND METHODS C. elegans strains and maintenance Strains were ordered from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and include the following: wild-type N2; CB130 dpy-8 (e130 ); VC2985 dpy-10 (gk3075 ) II; CB6627 srf-3 (e2689 ) IV; CB6177 bus-8 (e2883 ) X. All animals were grown at 20C under standard conditions to adulthood ( 52). NGM plates were seeded with either E. coli OP50 or mCeMbio strains, unless noted of a specific bacterium. For all experiments, L4 animals are placed on lawns and removed 12 hours later, leaving only offspring behind. Experiments are then performed on the offspring, unless otherwise noted. Culture and maintenance of mCeMbio bacteria Individual isolates of CeMBio bacteria, referred to as mCeMbio (gift from H. Schu lenberg, available now through CGC as CeMbio, see note below in Identification of mCeMbio) and CBX151 (a gift from Marie-Anne Flix), were streaked onto LB agar plates, and individual colonies were picked and grown in LB growth media. Individual bacteria (12 mCeMbio strains, CBX151, and OP50) were allowed to grow for 24 days, with shaking at 4 x g at 20C. Bacteria were maintained and prepared to OD 600  0.2 by dilution in additional LB or centrifuging at 1,800 x g for 5 minutes to remove excess LB to increase the concentration of slow-growing isolates. To make mCeMbio, each of the 12 bacteria were combined at equal ratios. Two hundred microliters of the bacteria was pipetted on 6-cm NGM plates and evenly spread across the agar plate using a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007358). Bacterial plates were left to dry in a laminar flow hood for 2 days. If not used immediately, seeded plates were stored at 4C. We maintain glycerol stocks of each bacterium at 80C, and these were used for each new batch of each mCeMbio strain, OP50, or CBX151 bacteria. Identification of mCeMbio strain JUb101 The Lelliottia amnigena, JUb66, genome sequenced in Houston by Buck Samuels group and the JUb66 genome sequenced in Kiel by Heinrich Schulenburgs group are different. The bacterial sample deposited at the CGC as part of the CeMbio consortium is the JUb66 from the Samuel Lab (JUb66 Houston), and the one from the Schulenburg lab is now known as JUb101. We acquired our strains from the Schulenburg lab. These two genomes have identical 16S rRNA representative sequences and the same number of 16S repeats. A whole-genome comparison of JUb66 Houston and JUb101 (formerly known as JUb66 Kiel) shows only 84 similarity. To determine the identity of our CeMbio strain, formerly known as JUb66 Kiel, we used the following PCR primers and standard NEB Taq protocols.

Bacterial plates ( n  3 for each group) were flooded with M9 and 30 animals were picked off with a glass pipette and placed into an Eppendorf tube. For unbleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 T M9 25 mM tetramisole hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich L9756) five times, allowing 4 minutes for animals to sink to the bottom of the tubes between each wash. For bleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 T two times and then washed with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 T  2.5 hypochlor ite 1M KOH) for 4 minutes. These tubes were rinsed with M9 T twice for 4 minutes each. After washes, animals were allowed to sink to the bottom of the tube. All but 100 L of media was removed in the final wash, and the tubes were frozen on dry ice and stored at 80C. For lawn plates, 1 mL of M9 was added to the plate, and the bacterial lawns were scraped with a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007358). Bacterial slurry was pipetted and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 4 minutes. All but 100 L was removed, and the pellet was frozen on dry ice and stored at 80C. DNA was extracted following the standard NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel 740952) protocol for animal tissue with 1 hour of incubation for the first lysis step. DNA was stored at 20C. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis For each experiment, an amplicon library targeting the V4V5 hypervariable region of the 16S gene was generated via one-step PCR using the Azura TruFi DNA Polymerase PCR kit, and the 515 F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) primer set was used ( 53). Each reaction was performed with an initial denaturing step at 95C for 1 minute, followed by 30 cycles of 95C for 15 seconds, 56C for 15 seconds, and 72C for 30 seconds. Two and a half microliters of each PCR reaction was run on a 1.8 agarose gel to confirm amplification. PCR products were purified using Beckman Coulter AMPure XP following the standard 1 x PCR clean-up protocol. PCR quantification was performed in duplicate using the Invitrogen Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit. Samples were then pooled in equal proportions (20 ng DNA per sample), followed by another AMPure XP PCR purification. The final libraries were evaluated on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation (D1000 ScreenTape), quantified with the Qubit HS dsDNA kit, and each library was sequenced at the University of California, San Diego IGM Genomics Center on a single Illumina MiSeq lane with a 25 PhiX spike-in. Amplicons were analyzed with QIIME2 v2019.10 ( 54). Briefly, demultiplexed paired- end reads were trimmed to remove adapter and primer sequences with cutadapt ( 55). Trimmed reads were then denoised with DADA2 to produce amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) ( 56). Taxonomic annotation of ASVs was conducted with the q2-feature-classi fier classify-sklearn nave-bayes classifier (57, 58), both the genome-derived reference 16S sequences of CeMbio strains ( 33) and the SILVA database (v138) ( 59). ASVs were then aggregated by the bacterial strain, and reads were normalized by the 16S gene copy numbers estimated by their genome assemblies ( 33). BrayCurtis dissimilarities, Shannon indices, and tests of statistical significance were then calculated with the QIIME2 diversity plugin on the normalized relative abundance count data ( 60, 61). Raw sequence data are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the BioProject accession PRJNA979901 . Data are sorted into experiment 1 and experiment 2 combine,  in which all wild-type, hermaphrodite samples, regardless of date of extraction or age, were included if they met the category bleached or unbleached (serially washed). These data are displayed in Fig. 2 and sorted by experiment. Fig. S2 displays data from combining experiment 1 and experiment 2, but only the samples in which the bleached and unbleached (serially washed) samples were prepared as a matched set on the same day and at day 1 of adulthood.Research Article Microbiology Spectrum August 2024 Volume 12 Issue 8 10.1128spectrum.00169-24 13Skin-swabbing with the 96-well plate assay To prepare the micro-swab, a glass capillary tube (World Precision Instrument Thin Wall Glass Capillaries-TW100-4 or similar) was pulled apart over a small flame into two pieces. Heat was used to create a small closed bulb at the pulled end of each piece, ensuring there were no crevices in which bacteria or liquids may accumulate, and then the glass was allowed to cool. Then, using 600-grain sandpaper, the bulb was lightly scored to make a textured surface (10 small circles on each side and tip). To sterilize, the swab is dipped in 70 ethanol and air-dried. To swab a lawn, the micro-swab is dipped into the lawn on which the animals were reared and then immediately swirled in the appropriate LB-containing wells. To swab an animal with the condition crawl,  a single animal is placed on an empty NGM agar plate using an eyelash pick and allowed to crawl for 30 seconds. Using a dissecting microscope, the animal was gently swabbed using the bulbous end from head to tail 10 times. The bulb was then dipped and swirled around in 10 circles into 200 L of LB in a 96-well plate (CoStar 96 Flat Black). Animals that were washed once 1 x wash were washed in M9 T and allowed to sink to the bottom of a tube. This was repeated two more times for 3 x wash.  For animals in the bleach group, they were first washed with M9 T three times, then once with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 T  2.5 hypochlorite 1M KOH), and once more with M9 T. Once washed or bleached, the animals were then pipetted onto a sterile NGM plate in a small volume and allowed to crawl out of the drop before being swabbed. Once all animals were swabbed, the OD 600 was measured using a Molecular Devices SpectraMaxPlus with absorbance  600 nm, manually taking measurements during standard work hours. To generate the curves in Fig. 1D, F and 3B D and F ,Fig. S1A through D and Fig. S3A through F, the individual replicate OD 600 values at each timepoint were averaged in each condition within an experiment. Our methods make use of area under the curve analyses, which can be used to compare and quantify data from multiple growth curves ( 62, 63). Colony-Forming Unit assay Animals were reared to day 1 of adulthood on chosen bacteria. Fifty adult worms were transferred to a 2-mL tube containing 100 L M9 and 1020 1 mm zirconium beads (Beadbug Z763780). Each tube of worms was washed three times for 3 minutes each with 750 L M9 tetramisole (25 mM), removing all but 100 L liquid with a new pipette tip each time, allowing animals to sink to the bottom of the tube by gravity. We separated half of the tubes to be bleached groups, which are subjected to a 4-minute wash with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 T  2.5 hypochlorite 1M KOH). Bleached animals are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9-T to remove the bleach. On the final wash, 100 L of the supernatant from each bleached tube is removed. Unbleached samples are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9-T, and 100 L of the supernatant is removed for each unbleached tube. Each sample is homogenized using a Fisher Mixer Mill at Level 4 for 30 seconds for four cycles, totaling 2 minutes of bead beating. The homogenate was then serially diluted (1 in 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 for each tube of 50 worms) in M9. One hundred microliters of each dilution was plated and spread with a sterile L spreader on LB agar plates. The previously removed supernatants were also diluted in M9 and plated. Plates were dried and left to grow for 48 hours. Finally, bacte rial colonies were counted to quantify the original bacterial colony counts in each sample (unbleached, bleached, and supernatant of both bleached and unbleached samples). Cuticle fragility assay Fifteen microliters of strong bleach solution (1M KOH and 5 hypochlorite) is pipetted onto a single day 1 adult animal after it has crawled on a clean NGM plate for 10 Research Article Microbiology Spectrum August 2024 Volume 12 Issue 8 10.1128spectrum.00169-24 14seconds. Under a dissecting microscope, the time to burst open (cuticle loses integrity) is recorded. Standard statistical analyses Fig. 1, 3, 4 ; Fig. S1 to S4 and their statistical analyses were completed in GraphPad Prism. Ungrouped two-sample t-tests were used when determining the statistical significance during comparisons of two groups. With three groups and more, an ANOVA test was performed for determining significance values. When appropriate, corrections were performed for multiple comparisons or unequal variances. Any P value smaller than 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical tests used in Fig. 2 are described under 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing and Analysis.
