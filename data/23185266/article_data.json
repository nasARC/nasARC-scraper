A clear link between estrogen deficiency andreduced bone mass is evident by the increased prevalence ofosteoporosis in women vs. men 1 and the direct associationbetween circulating estrogen levels and rates of bone loss 25. Inaddition, estrogen replacement serves to protect against skeletalfractures and loss of bone 6 primarily by inhibiting boneresorption 7. The preponderance of literature examining theeffects of estrogen status and bone remodeling has attributed theassociation to the direct effects of estrogen on bone cell activity.However, there are other possible mechanisms whereby postmen-opausal bone loss may be influenced and modulated. There is increasing evidence in the literature that the osseous vasculature influences bone remodeling. For example, vascularendothelial cells release factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI 2) that are known to modulate osteoclast and osteoblast activity 811. In addition, the osseous resistancevasculature regulates skeletal perfusion and, consequently, fluidfiltration and interstitial fluid flow, which can affect bone cell activity through release of autocrineparacine factors 1217.Dysfunction of these vascular mechanisms could thereforecontribute to postmenopausal and old age-related osteoporosis.Indeed, attenuated bone and marrow blood flow has beenreported in healthy humans ( .60 years of age) 18,19, senescent rats 2022 and rabbits 23 and is associated with osteopenia24. Old age-related decrements in skeletal perfusion alsocorrespond with diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilationof the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), reduced vascularNO bioavailability, and diminished trabecular bone volume and material properties of the femur in male rats 2022. Thus, aging and estrogen loss may contribute to enhanced bone turnover infemales through impairment of endothelial responsiveness in theskeletal circulation. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation inbone blood vessels, and whether this is associated with changesin trabecular bone volume. Estrogen levels were modified in youngand old female rats through ovariectomy and estrogen replace- PLOS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 November 2012  Volume 7  Issue 11  e48564ment. We hypothesized that the lower estrogen levels in old intact and young and old ovariectomized (OVX) rats would beassociated with lower femoral PNA endothelium-dependentvasodilation, and that estrogen replacement in young and oldOVX rats would enhance PNA endothelium-dependent vasodila-tion through a NO signaling pathway. Furthermore, we hypoth-esized that PNA endothelial vasodilator function would be directlyassociated with trabecular bone volume. Materials and Methods Ethical Approval The procedures used in this study were approved by the University of Florida and West Virginia University School ofMedicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees andconform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH PublicationNo. 85-23, revised 1996). Young (4 mon old) and old (22 mon old) virgin female Fischer- 344 rats were obtained from the vendor (National Institute ofAging colony, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) and divided into sixgroups: 1) young intact ( n 10), 2) old intact ( n 11), 3) young OVX ( n 10), 4) old OVX ( n 9), 5) young OVX E2 ( n 11), and 6) old OVX E2 ( n 10). After arrival all animals were housed for an additional 8 weeks in a temperature-controlled (23 62uC) room with a 12:12 h light dark cycle. Rats in the latter four groupsunderwent ovariectomy surgery and were housed post-operativelyfor 8 weeks. Thus, at the time of sacrifice young animals were atleast 6 months of age and old rats were at least 24 months of age.At 6 months of old, Fischer-344 rats are considered sexually-mature young adults, and at 24 months of age are consideredsenescent when mortality rates are 30 25. To control for the levels of exogenous estrogen, all rats were provided with aphytoestrogen-free diet and tap water ad libitum . Prior to sacrifice, at least two complete estrous cycles were monitored in all femalerats by daily vaginal smears. At the time of sacrifice, 3 ml of bloodwas collected in chilled tubes containing dipotassium EDTA.Blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 uC for 5 min, and the plasma was collected and stored at 280uC for later analysis. The ovaries (in intact females), uterus and cervix weredissected and trimmed of connective tissue and fat to obtainuterine mass. Plasma estrogen was determined with ELISAimmunoassay (Estradiol EIA kit, Oxford Biomedical; Oxford,MI). Rats were sacrificed at 6 and 24 months of age.Surgical Procedures To examine the influence of circulating estrogen on the vasomotor properties of the femoral PNA, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2oxygen balance) and subjected to bi-lateral ovariectomy according to standard procedures as described previously 26,27. Briefly, bilateral dorsolateral inci- sions were made through the top layer of skin. The underlying muscles were bluntly dissected until the ovary and fallopian tube were located. For rats in the OVX groups, the fallopian tube was ligated with absorbable suture and the ovary was removed. Once the surrounding fat pad was replaced within the abdominal cavity, the musculature and outer layer of skin was sutured. Estrogen replacement in the OVX E2 groups was performed simultaneous to the OVX procedure. Two 0.05 mg 17beta-estradiol 60-day slow release pellets (Innovative Research) were implanted subcu- taneously near the scapulae. In Vitro PNA Studies Rats were anesthetized (isoflurane 5O 2balance) and euthanized by removing the heart. To assess endothelium- dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA, in vitro experiments were performed. The femur and surrounding musculature was removed and placed in a dissecting dish containing physiological saline buffer solution (PSS) at 4 uC. The PNA was isolated from the femur and surrounding muscle tissue by use of a stereomicroscope as previously described 21,22. Briefly, the PNA was cannulated onto glass micropipettes, secured with 11-0 nylon microfilament suture (Alcon), and the vessel chamber placed under an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) equipped with a video camera (Panasonic BP310), video caliper (307A horizontal video caliper, Colorado Video), and data-acquisition system (PowerLab) for the measurement of intraluminal diameter. The PNAs were pressur- ized to 44 mmHg (60 cmH 2O) with two hydrostatic pressure reservoirs. This intravascular pressure was selected based on previously reported intravascular pressures of 43 61.8 mmHg and 4662.6 mmHg in skeletal muscle resistance arteries of similar size to the PNA in normotensive rats 28. PNAs were then checked for leaks, and those that were leak free were warmed to 37 uC and allowed to develop spontaneous baseline tone ( 1 h). Vessels that leaked or did not develop at least 20 spontaneous tone were discarded. Evaluation of Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilator Responses Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed by the cumulative addition of acetylcholine (ACh; 10291024M) to the Table 1.

Prior to each concentration-response protocol, the PNAs developed spontaneous tone. After completion of theexperimental protocols, the maximal diameters of the PNAs weredetermined subsequent to a 30-minute incubation period incalcium-free PSS buffer. Evaluation of Endothelium Signaling Pathways PNAs were cannulated and allowed to develop spontaneous tone. Vasodilation to ACh was evaluated after a 20-minincubation with one of the following: 1) PSS buffer alone, 2)PSS buffer containing the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitorN G-nitro- L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME, 1025M), 3) PSS buffer containing L-NAME (1025M) plus the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (Indo; 1025M) 21,22,29,30. Evaluation of Endothelium-Independent Vasodilator Responses Endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed by the cumulative addition of DEA NONOate (DEA; 10291024M) to the bathing medium. Prior to each concentration-responseprotocol, the PNAs developed spontaneous tone. After completionof the experimental protocols, the maximal diameters of the PNAswere determined subsequent to a 30-minute incubation period incalcium-free PSS buffer. Determination of Trabecular Bone Volume Trabecular bone volume of the distal femur metaphysis was assessed using microcomputed tomography (microCT; Skyscan1172) as previously described 21. Femora were wrapped inparafilm to prevent drying during the scanning. Scans wereobtained using an x-ray source, set at 60 kV and 167 mA over an angular range of 180 degrees (rotational steps of 0.40 degrees) witha 12- mm pixel size. Projection images were reconstructed using standard Skyscan software. The trabecular bone compartment wassegmented from the cortical shell for 50 slices in a region ,0.5- mm proximal to the most proximal portion of the growth plate foreach animal. Images were binarized (threshold of 100255) andtrabecular bone volumetissue volume (BVTV) was assessed. Solutions and drugs Stock solutions were prepared in distilled water; whereby ACh was frozen at 220uC and serial dilutions of the ACh stock solution were prepared daily. Serial dilutions of DEA NONOate wereprepared fresh as needed. Serial dilutions of the stock solutionswere prepared daily. All drugs were purchased from SigmaChemical (St. Louis, MO). Statistical Analysis Vasodilator responses were expressed as a percentage of maximal relaxation according to the following formula:Vasodilation  DsDb  DmDb  100 where Dm is the maximal inner diameter recorded at 60 cmH 2O in calcium-free PSS, Ds is the steady-state inner diameter recorded after each addition of the vasodilator substance, and Db is the initial baseline inner diameter recorded immediately prior to the first addition of ACh. One-way ANOVAs were used to determine the significance of differences in body mass, uterine mass, uterine:body mass ratio, plasma estrogen concentration, and spontaneous tone and maximal diameter of the PNAs. Repeated measures ANOVAs with pairwise comparisons were used to determine the significance of differences among age and within factors for vasodilator responses. To examine the relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume according to age and estrogen status, linear regression analyses were measured in young and old rats. In addition, regression analyses were performed examining the relations between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen, uterine mass, and peak vasodilation in old and old OVX rats. All data are presented as mean 6S.E. Significance was defined as P0.05. Results Animal and PNA Characteristics Body mass (Table 1) was higher in old vs. young intact animals. Body mass was greater in young OVX vs. young intact, andOVX E2 decreased body mass in both young and old animals compared to age-matched OVX groups. In addition, body mass was lower in old OVX E2 than in old intact animals. Plasma estrogen concentration for some of the animals in the old intact (5 out of 11), young OVX (1 out of 10) and old OVX (5 out of 9) groups was below the detectable range (5 pgml) for the ELISA immunoassay technique used to measure estrogen levels. Therefore, the estrogen concentrations reported for these three groups are an overestimate of the actual levels because estrogen values for these animals could not be included in the analysis. For this reason, we provide median and range values, as well as report uterine mass as a surrogate marker for estrogen concentration. Plasma estrogen concentration in young intact animals (median 62 pgml; range 26103 pgml) was greater than that in old intact rats (median 25 pgml; range 1836 pgml). OVX decreased plasma estrogen in young rats (median 22 pgml; range 632 pg ml), but did not alter estrogen levels in old rats (median 34 pgml; range 1849 pgml). In young animals OVX E2 increased plasma estrogen (median 40 pgml; range 3554 pgml) above that in the young OVX group and to a level similar of that in the young intact group. In the old rats OVX E2 increased plasma estrogen concentration (median 51 pgml; range 3178 pgml) tolevels above that in both the old intact and OVX groups. Uterine mass (Table 1) was lower in old intact vs. young intact rats. OVX decreased uterine mass in both age groups relative to age-matchedFigure 1.

There was an age-related difference in vasodilator responses between young and old INTACT female rats. Blockade with L-NAME significantly reduced vasodilation in both groups ( P,0.05) and abolished the age-related difference in the vasodilator response.

There were no differences in vasodilator responses between young and old OVX E2 rats under any of the three conditions.

OVX E2 elevated uterine mass in both age groups relative to age-matched OVX rats. Uterine mass was also greaterin old OVX E2 than in old intact animals, whereas uterine mass was lower in young OVX E2 relative to young intact. Age and condition effects on uterine:body mass ratio were similar to thoseof uterine mass (Table 1). Spontaneous tone of the PNA did not differ among groups (Table 1). However, PNA maximal diameters in young and oldOVX E2 were significantly greater than that of age-matched intact and OVX PNAs (Table 1). Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilator Responses ACh-induced vasodilation of the femoral PNA was lower in old intact relative to that in young intact (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of theNOS pathway with L-NAME abolished differences in vasodilationbetween the two age groups (Fig. 1A). The combined inhibition ofthe NOS and COX pathways further lowered vasodilation ofPNAs from young rats, and there remained no aging differences(Fig. 1A). Ovariectomy eliminated the old age-related difference in PNA vasodilation (Fig. 1B) that was evidenced between young and oldintact animals. L-NAME lowered vasodilator responses in PNAsfrom both young and old OVX rats, indicating that most of thevasodilator response occurred through the NOS signalingmechanism. The combination of L-NAME and Indo abolishedall vasodilation in the PNA of OVX animals (Fig. 1B). Ovariec-tomy with estrogen replacement also showed no age-relateddifference in vasodilation between young and old rats (Fig. 1C).NOS inhibition lowered endothelium-dependent vasodilatorresponses in OVX E2 rats, whereas the addition of the COX inhibitor Indo had little further effect in PNAs from both youngand old rats (Fig. 1C). In young rats, the lowering of estrogen levels with OVX lowered endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas estrogen repletionin OVX E2 rats restored vasodilation to levels equivalent to that in young intact rats (Fig. 2A). In PNAs from old rats, OVX had noeffect on endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses (Fig. 3A).The chronic addition of exogenous estrogen elevated vasodilationof PNAs from old rats (Fig. 3A) to levels that were similar to thosein young animals (Fig. 1C). DEA NONOate Vasodilator Responses Vasodilation to the direct NO donor DEA NONOate was not different among groups (Fig. 4), indicating differences in ACh-induced vasodilation were mediated through the PNA endothelialcells and not differences in the responsiveness of the smooth muscle cells. Trabecular Bone Volume In young rats, the lowering of plasma estrogen concentration through OVX reduced trabecular bone volume (BVTV) by 43 compared to young intact (Fig. 2B). Estrogen replacement in OVX E2 rats increased bone volume to levels similar to those inyoung intact rats (Fig. 2B). OVX in old rats had no effect on trabecular bone volume (Fig. 3B). However, the addition of exogenous estrogen resulted in 28 higher trabecular bone volume compared to controls (Fig. 3B). Regression Analyses Trabecular bone volume was significantly correlated to peak vasodilation in both young and old rats (Fig. 2C and 3C) whereby regression analyses indicated R2values of 0.641 and 0.671 in young and old rats, respectively. In addition, in rats with low estrogen status (i.e., young OVX, old intact and old OVX), there was no relation between trabecular bone volume and plasmaestrogen (Figs. 5A and 6A) or uterine mass (Figs. 5B and 6B). However, these groups displayed a significant relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C). Discussion The purpose of this study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral diaphyseal principal nutrient artery, and whether these putativechanges in vascular endothelial function are associated with alterations in trabecular bone volume. In young rats, the results demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariec-tomy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2A) and diminishes trabecular bone volume in the femur (Fig. 2B), whereas replacement of estrogen following ovariectomy maintains both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume. In old rats, ovariectomy had no effect on circulating estrogenlevels, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 3A) or trabecular bone volume (Fig. 3B). However, the addition of exogenous estrogen following ovariectomy elevated endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 3A) and increased bone volume (Fig. 3B). The estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodila-tion were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume in both young (Fig. 2C) and old (Fig. 3C) rats. To our knowledge, these are the first data to report the effects of ovariectomy and estrogen replacement on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone from young and old animals, and the first toexamine the relation between vascular function and bone properties with age and estrogen status as variables. It has long been appreciated that estrogen can have positive effects on the skeletal system. For example, during adolescent growth estrogen is the critical reproductive factor for both girls andboys 31. Additionally, a fall in estrogen concentration below 30 pgmL during menopause corresponds to the period of accelerated bone loss 31. The loss of estrogen followingmenopause creates an imbalance between bone resorption and formation that leads to a net loss of bone 32. Many postmenopausal women exhibit reduced bone mass as well as high-turnover bone metabolism, and the reversal of these conditions are observed following estrogen replacement 33.The preservation of bone mass during this period requiresFigure 2.

Estrogen receptors are presenton osteoblasts 34,35, but the actions of estrogen on these cellsand osteoblast-like cells have been variable 4. A recent studysuggests that the mechanism(s) of action of estrogen on bone cellactivity is related to the control of function and lifespan ofosteoclasts, which serves to ultimately minimize bone resorption33. The exact mechanism(s) through which estrogen acts tomodulate bone cell activity is not completely understood, allowingfor the possibility that non-skeletal tissue may act to modulatebone cell activity 31. We hypothesize that one such mechanism isrelated to bone vascular endothelial function and its ability to 1)directly influence bone cell activity through local release ofendothelium-derived signaling molecules such as NO and PGI 2 36,37, and 2) to regulate skeletal perfusion, which couldindirectly affect bone cell activity through its impact on fluidfiltration out of the vascular compartment and, correspondingly,interstitial fluid pressure in bone 13,3740. There is a growing body of literature that supports the notion that the bone vasculature can modulate bone cell activity 4042.In regard to old age-related bone loss, previous studies in humansand animals have shown compromised bone and marrow bloodflow are associated with osteopenia 1822 and studies in malerats have shown impaired bone vascular endothelial function isrelated to old age-induced bone loss 21,22. Additionally, a recentstudy has reported that a program of low-intensity endurance exercise training that elicits low mechanical strain on bone restoresendothelial NO-mediated vasodilation of the PNA and increasestrabecular bone volume and mineral density in the distal femur ofold male rats 21. The results demonstrated that old age-induceddecrements and training-induced enhancement of NO-mediatedvasodilation of the bone vasculature are positively correlated withchanges in the bone properties 21,22. Results from the present study also demonstrate an association between NO-mediated vasodilation of bone arteries and trabec-ular bone volume when estrogen status is altered throughovariectomy and estrogen replacement (Fig. 2C and 3C). Althoughthese findings are consistent with the general hypothesis that bonevascular endothelial function is coupled to bone remodelingactivity, these results alone are inconclusive since estrogen mayhave direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cellactivity, which could be independent of each other. Therefore, wesought to determine whether a relation exists between vascularendothelial function and bone volume in animals where estrogenconcentration was low, i.e., the young OVX and the old intact andOVX groups. Regression analyses indicated that there were norelations (P .0.05) between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen (Figs. 5A and 6A) or uterine mass (Figs. 5B and 6B), abiomarker for reproductive hormone status, indicating that thedirect effects of estrogen on cancellous bone volume are negligibleovariectomized and estrogen replaced (OVX E2) rats.

However, there was a significant association between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilationand trabecular bone volume (Figs. 5C and 6C) in the femur.These findings provide support for the concept of a vascularcoupling mechanism in bone. This conclusion of a couplingmechanism between the bone vasculature and bone mass is further supported by two studies in humans, where forearm conduit artery endothelial vasodilator responsiveness, used as a surrogate measure of bone endothelial function, was positively correlated with lumbar spine bone mineral density in postmenopausalwomen 43,44. Thus, in groups without the potentially confounding influence of estrogen, the relation between endothe- lial function and bone mass is still evident. Intact young and old female rats regulate vasodilation of the femoral PNA primarily through a NOS signaling mechanism and to a lesser extent through a COX signaling pathway (Fig. 1A). These regulatory mechanisms are similar to those of male animals,whereby endothelium-dependent vasodilation is mediated pre- dominantly via the NOS signaling cascade 21,22. The old age- associated decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in female rats results from declines in NO-mediated regulation, which is also similar to that observed in male rats. In the absence of estrogen (OVX group), vasodilation in the presence of L- NAME alone is eliminated (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, with estrogen replacement the regulating vasodilator mechanism shifts from the primarily NO signaling pathway to one that includes NO and theputative endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, as indicated by the significant vasodilation that occurs in estrogen replete rats when both NOS and COX signaling pathways are blocked (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the addition of estrogen from an exogenous source does not simply restore the regulatory mechanisms for vasodilation but alters the signaling mechanisms through which the peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the boneresistance vasculature is achieved. A shift in the mechanism of endothelium-dependent vasodilation with OVX has also been reported in mesenteric arteries. In intact rats, endothelium- dependent vasodilation of mesenteric arteries is mediated through both the NOS and COX signaling pathways; OVX diminished the NO-mediated component and augmented the contribution of the COX signaling pathway 45. The decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA with OVX in young rats has also been reported to occur in other vascular beds. For example, OVX has been shown to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of pulmonary arteries 46, the thoracic aorta 46, and coronary resistance arteries 26 in young rats. However, several studies examining the effects of OVX on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bonearteries of young animals have reported results that are dissimilar to those of the present investigation. In the first study, arterial segments from rabbits were isolated from the metaphyseal cancellous bone and the diaphyseal bone marrow of the femur six weeks after OVX 47. The vessel segments with a diameter of ,250 mm were cut into rings and two 40 mm diameter steel wires were passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. Changes inisometric force were measured with increasing concentrations of ACh after the arterial rings were preconstricted with norepineph- rine. The results indicated that OVX did not alter endothelium- dependent relaxation 47. The disparity of results compared to the current study could be due to several factors, including differences in 1) the animal species studied and 2) the techniques employed to study the vascular responses. For instance, unlike ratsand humans, rabbits do not undergo the various stages of the estrous cycle 48. Also, the wire myograph technique used is not ideal for determination of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in small diameter vessels because of the potential for the wires to damage endothelial cells as they are passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. The second study with disparate results relative to those of the current study investigated the effects of OVX in medullary Figure 5.

Vasodilation induced by ACh was not different between medullary arterioles from intact and OVX rats. The discrepancy in findings may result from differences in the strain of rat studied (Fischer-344 vs. Sprague Dawley), age of the animals at sacrifice (6 and 24 months vs. 3 to 3 Kmonths) and, most probably, differences in the period of OVX (2 months vs. 710 days). Few studies have examined the effects of OVX on endothelium- dependent vasodilation with advanced age. Castillo et al. 50 reported that relaxation of aortic rings to ACh was reduced in 20- month-old OVX rats. In contrast, OVX had no further effect to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of coronary resis- tance arteries 26 and femoral PNAs (present study) from old rats. These results indicate that the old age-associated decline in circulating estrogen may contribute to the overall reduction in endothelial cell vasodilator responsiveness that occurs with advancing age 21,22,27,29. The lack of bone loss with ovariectomy in the aged animals was counterintuitive to anticipated results and other published reports. For example, ovariectomy in rats 18 months of age has shown volume decrements in long bones as well as the vertebrae 5153.However, to our knowledge, there are no published reports on bone responses to ovariectomy utilizing rats of such an advanced age (i.e., 24 months) as the current investigation. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariectomy impairs endo- thelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2A) and diminishes trabec-ular bone volume (Fig. 2B) in the femur of young, but not in old female rats (Figs. 3A and 3B). Estrogen replacement following ovariectomy maintains and enhances both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume in young and oldanimals, respectively. The estrogen-induced alterations in endo-thelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated withchanges in trabecular bone volume in both young (Fig. 2C) andold (Fig. 3C) rats, indicating a possible coupling mechanismbetween the vascular endothelium and bone remodeling activity.Unfortunately, these results alone are inconclusive due to the fact that estrogen may have direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cell activity that are independent of each other.However, in young OVX and old intact and OVX animals,where circulating estrogen levels are low with negligible effects oncancellous bone volume (Figs. 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B), regressionanalysis demonstrated a significant relation between peak endo-thelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume(Figs. 5C and 6C) in the femur. These results provide supportfor a mechanism coupling vascular endothelial vasodilator signaling with bone volume. Author Contributions Conceived and designed the experiments: RDP J.

        "introduction": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by pronounced bone resorption. A clear link between estrogen deficiency andreduced bone mass is evident by the increased prevalence ofosteoporosis in women vs. men 1 and the direct associationbetween circulating estrogen levels and rates of bone loss 25. Inaddition, estrogen replacement serves to protect against skeletalfractures and loss of bone 6 primarily by inhibiting boneresorption 7. The preponderance of literature examining theeffects of estrogen status and bone remodeling has attributed theassociation to the direct effects of estrogen on bone cell activity.However, there are other possible mechanisms whereby postmen-opausal bone loss may be influenced and modulated. There is increasing evidence in the literature that the osseous vasculature influences bone remodeling. For example, vascularendothelial cells release factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI 2) that are known to modulate osteoclast and osteoblast activity 811. In addition, the osseous resistancevasculature regulates skeletal perfusion and, consequently, fluidfiltration and interstitial fluid flow, which can affect bone cell activity through release of autocrineparacine factors 1217.Dysfunction of these vascular mechanisms could thereforecontribute to postmenopausal and old age-related osteoporosis.Indeed, attenuated bone and marrow blood flow has beenreported in healthy humans ( .60 years of age) 18,19, senescent rats 2022 and rabbits 23 and is associated with osteopenia24. Old age-related decrements in skeletal perfusion alsocorrespond with diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilationof the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), reduced vascularNO bioavailability, and diminished trabecular bone volume and material properties of the femur in male rats 2022. Thus, aging and estrogen loss may contribute to enhanced bone turnover infemales through impairment of endothelial responsiveness in theskeletal circulation. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation inbone blood vessels, and whether this is associated with changesin trabecular bone volume. Estrogen levels were modified in youngand old female rats through ovariectomy and estrogen replace- PLOS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 November 2012  Volume 7  Issue 11  e48564ment. We hypothesized that the lower estrogen levels in old intact and young and old ovariectomized (OVX) rats would beassociated with lower femoral PNA endothelium-dependentvasodilation, and that estrogen replacement in young and oldOVX rats would enhance PNA endothelium-dependent vasodila-tion through a NO signaling pathway. Furthermore, we hypoth-esized that PNA endothelial vasodilator function would be directlyassociated with trabecular bone volume. Materials and",
