During gravistimulation, starch-containing amyloplastsmigrate to the downward side of the root columella cells,initiating migration of PIN proteins that then cause asymmetricredistribution of auxin toward the lower side of the root, which inturn causes curvature in the elongation zone to reestablish theroot into a vertical orientation. 3,611This series of signaling events acts upon a well-characterized distribution of auxin that arisesfrom a ow of auxin from the aerial portions of the plant through the central stele toward the root tip with an accumulation of auxinin the columella cells, which is then relieved by a ow back toward the aerial portions of the plant through the outer root cell layers.The movement and differential accumulation of auxin withinspeci c root tip cells is known as the reverse fountain  model 9,12 14(Figure 1a). It is this auxin accumulation and ow that forms the primary basis of the root s ability to respond to gravity.10,15Implicit in model s name is the notion that gravity establishes at least part of the pattern of distribution, just asdrops from a water fountain fall after the propelling force isovercome by gravity. Most references to these gravity-drivenresponses compare vertical togravistimulated , as if vertical is the ground state. The term vertical, de ned as an orientation perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, inexorably createsan implicit relationship in which the fundamental auxin reverse fountain is established and oriented along the Earth s gravity vector. We wished to know whether gravity has a direct physiologic role in establishing the auxin reverse fountain signaling system in primary roots. One of the major values of work on the ISS is theability to remove unit gravity from growth conditions. Thisallows a comparison with earthbound experiments with, forexample, agravitropic mutants that imply that gravity sensing canbe decoupled from the auxin ow. 1619We used Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis ) lines expressing gravity signaling uorescent reporter genes to examine the distribution of auxin and cytokinin in the primary roots of plants grown in two experimentson the International Space Station (ISS). We used the auxinarticial AuxRE promoter construct (pDR5r::GFP) 20as a gene expression level reporter of auxin levels throughout the root tip,especially in the central columella cells (C), and a TryptophanAminotransferase of Arabidopsis fusion (pTAA1::TAA1 GFP) 21to monitor auxin production in the Quiescent Center cells (QC).We used a Scarecrow fusion (pSCR::SCR GFP), 22to monitor the scarecrow transcription factor, which has a regulatoryrole in auxin biosynthesis, 11to monitor auxin-related signals in the endodermal layer and QC. We similarly monitored free- cytokinin levels in root tips using the Arabidopsis ResponseRegulator promoter (pARR5::GFP) reporter, which is similarlydistributed as the GUS reporter with the same promoter(pARR5::GUS). 23 1Department of Horticultural Sciences, Program in Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA and2Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology and Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.Correspondence: RJ Ferl (robferlu .edu) Received 7 September 2015; revised 23 November 2015; accepted 27 November 2015www.nature.comnpjmgrav All rights reserved 2373-806516  2016 Macmillan Publishers LimitedRESULTS This study used two methods of microscopy to evaluate the distribution of auxin and cytokinin green uorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene products in Arabidopsis roots during development in the space ight environment compared with ground controls; live imaging with standard uorescence optics in real time on the ISS and confocal imaging of preserved, returned samples. The results are a compilation of imaging data from two independent ISS experiments; CARA conducted in 2014 and APEX03-02 in 2015. This allowed an analysis of different growing conditions on the ISS and separate ight experiences with regard to signaling in the Arabidopsis primary root. The region of interest in these evaluations is comprised of the root tip cells that participate in auxin transport (Figure 1a). Of particular interest are the columella cells and columella initials (green, Figure 1a), the cells of the quiescent center and surrounding initials (peach and dark blue, Figure 1a), the endodermis (light blue, Figure 1a) and the stele (white, Figure 1a). Figure 1b provides a confocal micrograph of the region diagramed in Figure 1a and shows the typical reference expression pattern of GFP signal from DR5r::GFP in a 4-day-old Arabidopsis root. Plant development and root morphology is different between the CARA and APEX03-2 experiments The CARA and the APEX03-2 experiments represent two very different approaches to conducting a plant experiment on the ISS, and the plants grown within these two distinct experiments exhibit distinct morphologies. Within each experiment, however, the environmental conditions between the space ight habitat and the ground control habitat were comparable. The reduced lighting habitat of the CARA plants resulted in slower development relative to their chronological age in comparison to plants grown under the higher light levels of APEX03, as can be seen examining the 8-day plants of Figure 2d,g. The roots of the space ight CARA plants grew in tight loops and coils (Figure 2d,g), which is a distinctly different morphology than was seen in previous space ight-grown Arabidopsis plants.24,25The 4-day and 8-day APEX03-2 plants housed in the more optimal lighting environment of the Vegetable Production System (VPS) displayed the more advanced development expected for plants growing under a higher light environment (Figure 2e,f,h,i) than didthe plants in the lower light environment of CARA. The roots ofthe 4-day APEX03-2 space ight plants were more linear in appearance, and exhibited much of the skewing behavior observed in pervious space ight experiments (Figure 2h). However, the 8-day plants of APEX03-2 (Figure 2i) were far lessorganized than the straighter growth seen previously in the directional light environment of the Advanced Biological Research System ABRS hardware, 24,25but still did not grow in the tight loops and coils of the CARA plants (Figure 2g). The space ight distribution of DR5r::GFP was indistinguishable from that of vertically grown roots on the Earth in two separate space ight experiments The distribution of DR5r::GFP in the roots of plants grown on the ISS was identical to that of the ground controls over the course ofthe two different ISS experiments and several plant ages. (Figure 4, Supplementary Table S1). The APEX03-2 experiment was com- prised of plants grown in the VPS growth facility (Figure 2b,c) andthen imaged in the LMM after 4 and 8 days of growth (Figure 2e,f,h,i). In addition, 4-day-old samples from APEX03-2 were xed in RNAlater and frozen on orbit, enabling confocal microscopy after sample return. Plants of the CARA experiment were grown inambient cabin lighting of the ISS for 5 days before imaging (Figure2a,d,g). As detailed in the Materials and Methods section, the comparable ground controls for both experiments were grown in a specialized chamber programed with the environmentalparameters (CO 2, temperature, humidity, and lighting) experi- enced by the ISS-grown plants, and all live imaging on the ISS conducted with the LMM (Figure 3) was directly compared with the LMM Ground Imaging Unit (GIU). Live imaging with the LMM on orbit illustrates that the same pattern of DR5r::GFP distribution was seen in the space ight grown and ground control plants of APEX03-2 in both 4-day-old(Figure 4a,b) and 8-day-old (Figure 4c,d) plants. Developmentalage did not impact DR5r::GFP distribution in CARA either. The distribution of DR5r::GFP was identical in space ight and ground control plants for both 5-day-old (Figure 4e,f) and 8-day-old rootsof the CARA plants (Figure 4g,h). In all cases, the LMM images ofDR5r::GFP were consistent with expression patterns appropriately limited to the cells of the columella. Confocal microscopy with RNAlater-preserved roots from APEX03-2 enabled cellular resolution of the columella. The cellular resolution showed that the distribution of DR5r::GFP observed in the live imaging was indeed localized to the columella. Thedistribution of DR5r::GFP in the columella cells of the groundcontrol (Figure 4i) and space ight (Figure 4j) was unchanged with respect to the gravity environment (see also Supplementary Movie S1 and Supplementary Movie S2). Quanti cation of the confocal Z-stack volumes for GFP signal revealed no signi cant quantitative differences in the expression between space ight and ground control samples for pDR5r::GFP ( T-test, P 0.55; Supplementary Figure S1). Distributions of two proteins associated with auxin signaling were also unchanged in space ight The distributions of TAA1::TAA1 GFP and SCR::SCR GFP, respectively, were identical in between space ight and ground control plants. The TAA1::TAA1 GFP and SCR::SCR GFP reporter gene lines were used in the APEX03-2 experiment (Figure 2e,f,h,i),and as with the DR5r::GFP plants, 4-day-old samples were xed in RNAlater and frozen on orbit for confocal microscopy. There was no change in the distribution of TAA1::TAA1 GFP expression in the cells in and around the quiescent center (Figure 1a) between Figure 1. Reverse Fountain model and DR5 distribution.

The individual cells involved could be seen with confocal imaging of preservedreturned samples (Figure 5a,b, and Supplementary Movies S3, S4),which supported the identical position of TAA1::TAA1 GFP between ight and ground that was seen in the root tip during live imaging with the LMM (Figure 5e,f). Quanti cation of the confocal Z-stack volumes for GFP signal revealed potential slightlyhigher expression levels in space ight for TAA1::TAA1 GFP that were not statistically well supported ( T-test, P 0.06; Supplementary Figure S1). The nuclear localization SCR::SCR GFP in endodermal cells also appeared unchanged between ight and ground control plants. Live imaging with the LMM showed a contiguous endodermal surface for both space ight and ground control (Figure 5g,h). Inreturned samples examined with confocal microcopy, longitudinal Z-sections through the endodermal layer (refer to Figure 1a) displayed some variably among samples near the QC, but thisvariation was not consistent within treatments (Figure 5c,d, and inset of Figure 3d). The distribution of cytokinin was different in space ight as compared with ground control roots The distribution of ARR5::GFP was different in the space ight grown plants compared to the comparable ground controls. Plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP expression compared with ground controls. In the 5-day roots ofCARA, ARR5::GFP expression was restricted to the very tip of the Figure 2. Experiment con guration and space ight-unique operations. The Petri plates of plants in CARA were grown in ambient lighting in the ISS on the interior wall of the Destiny module of the ISS ( a), while the APEX03-2 experiment the plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPSVeggie) in the Columbus module of the ISS.

DISCUSSION The plants examined here were derived from two distinct space ight experiments. CARA and APEX03-2 were launched months apart, and utilized different hardware and growth habitats. The developmental appearance and root growthstrategies of respective plants from CARA and APEX were quite different (Figure 2d i). This diversity provided the opportunity to observe auxin signaling in two different ISS growth habitats andtwo distinct space ight experiences separated by several months, which thereby removed the possibility of experiment processing, or local environmental factors other than space ight, impacting the results. It is well established that there are changes in root morphology and in the gene expression patterns of Arabidopsis plants grown in a space ight environment, and many of the differentially expressed genes are associated with auxin and cytokininsignaling. 24,26 28However, global patterns of gene expression from whole roots24or whole seedlings2628do not reveal changes that occur in individual cells. Here we employ GFP reporter gene Figure 3. Light Microscopy Module operations. The LMM is located in the Destiny Module of the ISS ( a, red arrow). The Petri plate was photographed and mounted on the LMM Petri base ( b, red arrow) before being inserted into the LMM ( c, red arrow).

Plants in the microgravity of space ight establish an auxin distribution that is indistinguishable from that of a vertical orientation on the Earth. The distribution of DR5r::GFP in theroots of plants grown on the ISS was identical to that of theground controls over the course of the two ISS experiments, several plant ages, and varied root morphologies (Figure 4). The expression of DR5r::GFP was evident in, and appropriately limitedto, the columella cells of the root tip. The columella cells areconsidered the primary gravity-sensing cells of the root 29and the DR5r::GFP expression patterns observed on the ISS are consistent with previous reports of DR5r::GFP distribution in the primaryroots of plants grown vertically on the Earth.8In both, the live imaging on orbit with the LMM (Figure 4a h) and the cellular resolution made possible with the confocal analysis of preservedsamples (Figure 4i,j), there is no discernable difference in thedistribution of DR5r::GFP expression between ISS-grown plants and their comparable ground controls. Though widely used for characterizing auxin distribution, as a transcriptional reporter DR5r::GFP does have limitations insensitivity and response time for reporting auxin locations and concentrations, and it does not reveal all aspects of auxin- responsive gene activity. The initial observations presented herecould be extended greatly in future ights through the use of more sensitive and non-transcriptional auxin reporter systems. In addition, exploration of sites of auxin action away from the root tip, such as shoots, root anks and junctions, as well as lateral Figure 4.

Plants in space ight also appear unchanged with respect to a second source of auxin; synthesis of auxin within the quiescent center. Auxin is synthesized in the QC cells, cells that are part of the stem cell niche (SCN) in the root apical meristem and that giverise to the gravity-sensing columella cells of the root tip21 (Figure 1a). The importance of this source of auxin to the gravity-sensing mechanism in roots is revealed by the fact excised root tips, without the auxin source of the reverse fountain, exhibita response to gravity.30We used the pTAA1::TAA1 GFP native promoter protein fusion reporter to monitor the amount of the auxin in these essential QC cells. TAA1 encodes an aminotransfer- ase that regulates auxin biosynthesis within the QC cells, andcontributes to gravitropic signaling.31The TAA1::TAA1 GFP in 5-day and 8-day-old plants on orbit showed a distribution of GFP expression that was indistinguishable from similarly grown groundcontrol plants (Figure 5a,b,e,f), and is consistent with what istypically expected in vertically grown plants. 21These results suggest that auxin synthesis of the QC is not in uenced by gravity. Also unchanged in microgravity is the distribution of the GRAS family transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR), a key transcriptionfactor involved in the maintenance of the SCN32and regulating the radial organization of the root.22,33 35SCR is essential to stem cell activity in the root apical meristem, the organization of theroot cap and QC, as well as the production of auxin as itcontributes to the reverse fountain ow. In the QC, SCR negatively regulates genes associated with auxin biosynthesis and mediates phytohormone cross-talk among the actively growing root Figure 5.

This suggests that the upstreamregulatory circuits for critical auxin synthesis steps are intact inspace ight. The space ight distribution of SCR::SCR GFP, together with the expression of TAA1::TAA1 GFP and DR5::GFP, strongly suggests that the entire auxin signaling pathway is fullydeveloped in the absence of gravity. Unlike the distribution of auxin, the phytohormone cytokinin exhibited different patterns of distribution between the space ight and ground environments. Cytokinins are counterpoints to auxin, including in the cross-talk among theroot zones that plays a role in gravity responses. 36,37We examined the distribution cytokinin using ARR5::GFP, as the ARR5 gene is induced in the presence of free cytokinin.23Plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP compared to ground controls (Figure 5i l). In the ight plants, the expression of ARR5::GFP appeared limited to the columella and lateral root cap,whereas in the ground control plants ARR5::GFP expressionextended shoot-ward from the root tip through the stele. The primary source for cytokinin production in the root tip is the columella cells. In a vertical orientation on the Earth, ARR5expression is highest in the columella, but also extends shoot-ward through the stele, a pattern that can expand in response to gravistimulation. 23On the Earth, cytokinins also have roles in root curving,38coiling and waving, and can in uence features of the actin lament organization, which in turn affects root growth patterns.39,40Plants grown on the ISS exhibit altered waving and skewing morphologies, as well as differences in the patterns of celldivision and elongation.25It is possible that cytokinin plays a larger role in these altered root growth strategies than does auxin, in the absence of gravity experienced during space ight. In addition, the repressed distribution of cytokinin as revealed byARR expression in the space ight grown roots may also re ect a cytokinin in uence in overall reduction in growth rate and development.41,42 Our results demonstrate one of the values in conducting experiments on the ISS; the ability to remove gravity from theenvironment and thus examine the role of gravity in fundamental biological processes. In this particular case, our data show that auxin distributions of the primary root are not gravity dependent,even though these distributions are key to gravity responses. It is therefore likely that the role of gravity is minimal compared with the inherent developmental cues guided by auxin to de ne the architecture of the root tip. Indeed, these experiments thatessentially remove the forces of gravity, join with previous studies that used genetics to uncouple gravitropism from auxin distribu- tion (for example, refs. 16 19) to complete the notion that auxin gradients in the primary root are fundamentally developmental.Those developmental auxin gradients were coopted then to be sensitive to gravity responses and it seems logical then that the auxin signaling system in roots was present in plants as adevelopmental system before evolving additional roles in gravity responses. The role of auxin in structures other than the root tip bears investigation, as auxin-regulated genes are seen to changein expression during space ight, when examining the root as a whole, and root architecture is also in uenced by space ight. The value of the present study is in having cell-speci c reporters to begin the challenge of nding where in the root potential space ight auxin-regulated changes do occur. The data presented here suggest that those auxin-related changes do not occur in the major gravity-sensing cells of the primary root tip, as the distribution of DR5::GFP TAA::GFP and SCR::GFP are not affectedby space ight at least to the level of sensitivity afforded by these reporters. There is unintended and unrealized bias in some of the terminology used to describe the gravity response mechanismsand models of primary roots, in that there is an unwritten implication that the default or resting auxin distribution of theprimary root is set up by gravity; that it is the vertical orientation that sets up the auxin distribution in the root tip. The term vertical carries a direct association with the gravity vector. Without the ability to remove gravity from the plant environment,there was no reason to eliminate the term from the vernacular orthe force from the concept. Our results show that the reverse fountain is neither reverse nor a fountain, as these terms imply that gravity is involved in the reversal of liquid ow. Rather, the auxin ow of the primary root tip is fundamentally no different from the auxin ow systems that guide other parts of plant primary development, except that it has been further engaged in the gravity response. MATERIALS AND METHODS Space ight launches and NASA experiment operational nomenclature The data presented here are taken from two independent experiments launched to the ISS. CARA (Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-3 on 18 April 2014. The cargo DragonCapsule was carried by a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Complex 40, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL, USA. CARA is also identi ed by the NASA operations nomenclature (OpNom) of Petri Plants , and was one of the ARK1 payloads own by the Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) (http:www.nasa.govmission_pagesstationresearchexperiments1064.html). APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015, also in a Dragon Capsule carried by a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Complex 40. APEX03-2 is alsoidenti ed by NASA OpNom TAGES-ISA (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System Intracellular Signaling Architecture: http:www.nasa. govmission_pagesstationresearchexperiments1059.html). Plant lines and plate preparations Four Arabidopsis GFP reporter lines were used in these experiments: pDR5r::GFP, a synthetic auxin response element composed of ve AuxRE elements (TAIR line CS9361),24,43pTAA1::TAA1 GFP, (TAIR line CS16432, AT1G70560),21pSCR::SCR GFP (TAIR line CS3999, AT3G54220)22 and pARR5::GFP (TAIR line CS23893, AT3G48100).23Both space ight experiments included pDR5r::GFP; however, pARR5::GFP was limited to CARA, and pTAA1::TAA1 GFP and pSCR::SCR GFP were limited to APEX03-2. Within each experiment, all genotypes were planted on a single Petri plate designated for imaging (Figure 2d i). The laboratory preparations and launch conditions were identical for both CARA and APEX03-2. Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2solid media plates comprised of 0.5 Phytagel0.5  MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com).24,25The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10 C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4 C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of theexperiment on the ISS. Although the plates were kept refrigerated where possible, the dark treatment ensured dormancy even if the plates were to experience excursions into ambient temperatures. Plant growth conditions on the ISS and comparable ground controls CARA and APEX03-2 were distinctly different experiments, each with unique growth habitats and hardware. However, within each experiment, the environmental conditions of the respective habitats were carefully controlled such that the growth conditions on the ISS closely matchedthose of their respective ground controls. This was accomplished by running the ground controls discontinuously; a 24-h delay for CARA and a 48-h delay for APEX03-2. These delays enabled the telemetric collection of environmental data from the ISS, which were then used to program the ISS Environmental Simulation (ISSES) chamber at the Space Station ProcessingFacility at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO 2levels and lighting that had been experienced by the space ight plants in the previous 24 h (or 48 h, respectively).GFP microscopy: the auxin gradient on orbit RJ Ferl and A-L Paul 7  2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited npj Microgravity (2016) 15023CARA . The CARA experiment was designed for the plants to be grown in the low-level, diffuse ambient lighting of the US Lab in the Destiny Module of the ISS. The CARA plates received between 4 6molesm2s total light. The plates were con gured with Velcro tabs that facilitated attachment to a cloth support that was af xed a wall of the Destiny Module (Figure 2a). The experiment was activated by unwrapping the plates and attachingthem to the wall of the module. The exposure to light initiatedgermination. Five days after germination was initiated, the platedesignated for microscopy was removed from the wall by astronaut SteveSwanson, photographed with an SLR camera before imaging (Figure 2g).Ground control plates were mounted on the wall of the ISSES chamber at KSC (Figure 2d). APEX03-2 . The APEX03-2 experiment plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPSVeggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS (Figure 2b,c). The 10-cm 2Petri plates were housed perpendicular (vertical ) to the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. Plants received between 100 135molesm2s PAR inside the VPS. Four and eight days after germination was initiated by unwrapping the plates and exposingthem light in the VPS, the plate designated for microscopy was removedby the astronaut Butch Wilmore, photographed with an SLR camera before imaging (Figure 2h,i). In the case of APEX03-2, the ground control plates were grown inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES chamber at KSC(Figure 2e,f). Live imaging on the ISS Live imaging in both the CARA and APEX experiments was conducted with the LMM housed in Destiny Module (Figure 3a), and with the LMM GIU, which is housed at GRC, Cleveland, OH, USA. The LMM on the ISS is amodi ed Leica RXA microscope adapted for a microgravity environment that is held within the glovebox of the Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) to helpmanage potentially dangerous or liquid-containing payloads within theFIR. Although an astronaut was required for the loading of the samplestage, the microscope is operated telemetrically from GRC by FIR and LMMcontrollers, who were in turn guided by the authors. In both the CASIS and APEX experiments, the astronaut on duty photographed the seedling- containing Petri plate before loading into the LMM; either by holding infront of the video feed camera (Figure 3b, red arrow), or with a standardSLR camera (Figure 2g i). The plate was then loaded onto the LMM Petri support base and af xed to the microscope stage (Figure 3c, red arrow). Comparable operations were conducted with the ground control plates(Figure 2d f). The SLR photographs were used to create root maps to guide the telemetric maneuvers to locate regions of interest on the Petri plates. The image in Figure 3d illustrates how the photograph of the seedlings onthe plate was overlaid with the coordinate map for the LMM microscopestage. All operations of the stage in x,yand zwere conducted telemetrically by maneuvering the motorized stage through upload ofnumerical coordinates. The numbers along the periphery of the eld of view in Figure 3d de ne the xand ycoordinates. The stage could also be moved in the zdirection for focus, and also for the collection of different focal planes. LMM images are collected with a Q-Imaging Retiga 1300 CCDcamera (Burnaby, BC, Canada) with a resolution of 1,280  1,024 and 2  2binning. The white-light images from the LMM were captured using thebeam splitter option on the LMM and LMM GIU. GFP uorescence was visualized using the CHROMA FITC Filter Set: Exciter wavelength 480,Dichroic wavelength 505, and Emitter wavelength 535. The 10  objective (numerical aperture 0.3) was used in CARA, and the 20  objective (numerical aperture 0.4) was used in APEX03-2; these are both dry objectives; necessary as the plants were viewed through the lid of the Petriplate. The management and administration of the LMM operations wasconducted by the personnel of GRC, particularly through the efforts ofteams from ZIN Technologies. The authors oversaw the data collection anddrove sample and region of interest selection in real time operations. Imaging of returned samples In the APEX03-2 experiment, a four-day-old imaging plate containingpDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1 GFP and pSCR::SCR GFP was harvested to RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA), into Kennedy Space CenterFixation Tubes (KFTs). KFTs are space ight hardware providing three levels of liquid containment for xing biological samples in space. 24,44After collection, the loaded KFTs were stowed at 80 C in the MELFI freezer on the ISS; ground controls were also collected to KFTs, but were stowed in astandard 80 C freezer. The samples were kept frozen until the sampleswere returned to the authors laboratory. The preserved plants were then imaged on the ground with a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (Mannheim, Germany) in the Cytometry Core at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. The roots were prepared by rinsing in distilled water for 2 min, and then either mounted directly in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories,Burlingame, CA, USA) or counterstained with a 0.1 solution of Calco uor White for 5 min. Calco uor White staining was followed by a 5 min wash in distilled water and then mounting in Vectashield for imaging. The imagingparameters for confocal microcopy were kept identical between space- ight and ground control samples within each genotype, although these parameters could vary among genotypes. For instance: pTAA1::TAA1 GFP, space ight and ground, was imaged with the following parameters: exposure 62, pinhole 69, zoom of 1, step size 2.98, line average 2, FC gainof 700 and offset at 3.0. pDR5r::GFP imaging parameters were identical to those used for pTAA1::TAA1 GFP, although the gain was increased for all pDR5r::GFP roots (for both space ight and ground) to 760. The 40  oil objective was used throughout, and the 488 laser was kept at 38. Keeping the imaging parameters constant between space ight and ground control samples enabled clear comparisons of the same relative location within the space ight and ground roots. Image rendering and quanti cation LMM and LMM-GIU images are captured as .bmp les. All .bmp les were converted to .tif les using Photoshop. The .tif les were transferred to Volocity 6.3 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for analysis andimage presentation. The Fine FilterRemove Noise function was used to eliminate bad pixels in the GFP images. Images from confocal microscopy of the returned samples were exported as .tif les from the Leica Application Suite. Quanti cation of uorescent signal within selected Regions of Interest in confocal imaged samples was calculatedusing PerkinElmer Volocity 3D Image Analysis Software (Supplementary Figure S1).
