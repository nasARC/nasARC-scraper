Inthis study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydcI or STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram-negative bacterialgenera. Gene expression analysis shows that ydcI is expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its autoregulation in S. Typhimurium. We demonstrate that puried YdcI protein specically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We constructed an S. Typhimurium H9004ydcI mutant strain and show that this strain is more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT strain,and this defect is complemented in trans . Moreover, our data indicate that ydcI is part of the rpoS regulon related to stress resistance. The S. Typhimurium H9004ydcI mutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in which ydcIexpression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction of ydcI expression in S. Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biolm in stationary-phase cultures. These data indicate the ydcI gene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to stress resistance and possibly virulence. Bacterial growth environments characterized by low uid shear force have been shown to induce a multitude of pheno-typic responses, including altered acid, oxidative, thermal, andosmotic stress resistance (7, 33, 36, 41, 5255), increased bio-lm formation (6, 33, 52), altered protein secretion (14, 15),altered cell surface lipid and polysaccharide proles (6, 7, 55),and increased survival in cellular and animal hosts (39, 5254).Notably, the virulence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimu- rium is increased by low uid shear growth conditions as mea-sured using murine infection assays and tissue culture models(39, 5254). Low uid shear force (dened here as approxi-mately H110210.01 to 0.2 dynescm 2) is characterized by a low- turbulence, low-agitation environment, as opposed to highuid shear (dened here as approximately from 5 to H1102250 dynescm 2) where liquid moves with higher velocity over the cellular surface (35, 21, 23, 25, 36). Low uid shear growthenvironments include spaceight, ground-based suspensionculture models such as the rotating-wall vessel (RWV) biore-actor, and the spaces between cellular microvilli, the last ofwhich is encountered by numerous pathogens during the nat-ural course of infection (21, 23, 25, 30, 40, 41). Previous workhas shown that bacteria grown in low uid shear environmentsinduce a molecular response which includes genome-widechanges in gene expression (the low uid shear stimulon) (6, 7, 39, 48, 52, 53, 55). Since growth under low uid shear condi-tions is able to induce cellular phenotypes which are difcult orimpossible to obtain via conventional culture methods, there ismuch potential for important previously uncharacterized genesand regulatory schemes to be revealed via the study of the lowuid shear response. The rst studies to identify the bacterial genes of the low uid shear stimulon were performed with S. Typhimurium cultures grown in an RWV bioreactor (39, 55) and duringspaceight (52, 53). Genes of the S. Typhimurium low uid shear stimulon were found to be distributed across the genomeand belong to a wide variety of functional groups, includingvarious transport systems, lipopolysaccharide synthesis path-ways, protein secretion mechanisms, various metabolic path-ways, and genes of unknown function (52, 53, 55). In addition,several genes encoding previously uncharacterized transcrip-tional regulatory proteins in S. Typhimurium were also found to be part of the low uid shear stimulon (52, 53, 55). Thesegenes are of particular interest not only for their potential rolein mediating bacterial responses to low uid shear but also fortheir potential to allow us to better understand the globalcircuits that inuence bacterial physiology in general. It ishighly likely that previously unexplored transcriptional regula-tors that are identied via the low uid shear stimulon will beinvolved in aspects of prokaryotic biology that are able to bestudied under standard conditions outside the context of lowuid shear. The S. Typhimurium gene ydcI (also known as STM1625 in theS. Typhimurium genome) belongs to the aforementioned class of potential transcriptional regulators that are members  Corresponding author.

However, the ydcI gene is completely uncharacterized and has not been previously studied beyond being identied viagenome sequence analysis. This study aimed to characterizetheydcI gene (and the YdcI protein) to answer basic questions regarding its role in S. Typhimurium biology and the function of its protein product. Our results indicate that the S. Typhi- murium ydcI gene (i) is conserved across genera, (ii) autoregu- lates its expression, (iii) encodes a DNA binding protein thatbinds with specicity, (iv) is required for full resistance of S. Typhimurium to acid stress, (v) appears to be a member of therpoS regulon, and (vi) when induced, alters S. Typhimurium interactions with host cells and facilitates biolm formation.To our knowledge, this is the rst report to demonstrate that apreviously uncharacterized gene identied via study of the lowuid shear stimulon is involved in responses that can be ob-served outside the low uid shear environment. This report provides a foundation for further analysis of the ydcI gene and other previously uncharacterized transcriptional regu-lators of the low uid shear stimulon. The study of thesegenes may allow us to engineer bacteria for benecial pur-poses by disrupting or inducing certain signals in a con-trolled manner resulting in improved vaccines and otherapplications (10, 11, 32). MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, plasmids, and media. Please refer to Table 1 for a list of strains and plasmids used in this study. S. Typhimurium strain H92733339 was used as the wild type (WT), and all mutations were analyzed in this background (22).Construction of the S. Typhimurium H9004ydcI mutation was performed using lambda Red recombination as previously described (12, 45) and by using theDNA primers listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. A Cm rcassette from pKD3 (12) was inserted at nucleotide 166 of the S. Typhimurium ydcI open reading frame (ORF) in the same orientation as the ydcI ORF. To obtain the H9004ydcI::lacZ fusion, the Cmrcassette at the site of the H9004ydcI mutation was deleted using Flp recombinase expressed from pCP20 (12), and then the lacZ plasmid pCE36 (13) was inserted at the single FRT site at this location as previouslydescribed (13). To construct the WT ydcI::lacZ fusion, we performed an identical procedure by inserting the Cm rcassette immediately after the stop codon of ydcI and inserting pCE36 at this location. The strain containing Cm:: lacZ was ob- tained by inserting the Cmr-encoding gene from pKD3 immediately upstream of thelacZ gene in the H9004ydcI::lacZ mutant strain using Red recombination such that the Cmr-encoding gene promoter replaces the ydcI promoter and drives lacZ expression. All constructions were veried using PCR analysis. The H9004rpoS mu- tation (which is marked by Apr) was transferred via P22 transduction from donor strainH92734973 (38). To restore WT rpoS in the WT ydcI::lacZH9004rpoS strain, a strain containing a Cmrmarker at gene STM2901 (located approximately 20 kb from therpoS gene) was used as a donor for P22 transduction, and Cmrrecipients were screened for ampicillin sensitivity (50). A CmrAprisolate from this trans - duction was used as a control. Plasmid pBAD18 H11001ydcI was constructed using a synthesized ydcI gene in which a six-histidine tag was fused to the C terminus and cloned into pUC57 (56) and then subcloned into pBAD18 (24) downstream ofthe arabinose-inducible promoter (Genscript, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The entirelength of the construct was veried via sequencing. Strains were grown using LB(Lennox) medium supplemented with the following antibiotics when necessary:ampicillin, 200 H9262gml; chloramphenicol, 10 H9262gml; kanamycin, 50 H9262gml. Sequence analysis. The YdcI homologs from the indicated Gram-negative species were identied using BLAST search analysis with S. Typhimurium YdcI (GenBank accession no. AAL20543) as the query (1). Homologs were alignedusing CLUSTAL W analysis as previously described (46, 51). Gene expression analysis. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed as described previously (51, 55), using approximately 4 to 6 H9262g RNA from late-log- phase cultures (optical density at 600 nm OD 600H110050.9 to 1.4). RNA was isolated using RNA Protect reagent and RNeasy spin prep kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). LacZ assays were performed with late-log-phase cultures usingstandard protocols as described previously (35), and the data presented repre- sent the mean and standard deviation of three or four independent experimentseach assayed in duplicate or triplicate reactions. Expression and purication of YdcI protein. Escherichia coli strain TOP10 containing pBAD18 H11001ydcI was grown to an OD 600of approximately 0.5 to 0.8, induced with 0.1 arabinose, and then grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested, lysed using B-Per reagent (PierceThermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL), andprocessed for isolation of YdcI protein (with a six-histidine tag) using nickel-agarose spin columns in accordance with the manufacturers instructions (ZymoResearch, Orange, CA). Coomassie staining and Western blot analysis withanti-six-histidine antibody (Immunology Consultants Lab, Inc., Newberg, OR)were performed using standard protocols as described previously (2, 49, 50). Gel shift assays. Gel shift reactions were performed in the presence of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mMEDTA, 1 H9262g salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1 H9262gml bovine serum albumin with approximately 1 ng of probe. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min atroom temperature before being loaded onto a prerun 8 acrylamide gel in 0.5 H11003 Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer at 150 V. Probe labeling and detection wereperformed using a nonradioactive kit in accordance with the manufacturersinstructions (PierceThermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL) with positively charged nylonmembrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The 180-bp probe H3 consisted ofDNA extending upstream from 38 bp downstream of the ydcI ATG codon ( S. Typhimurium coordinates 1714755 to 1714935) that was PCR amplied using theprimers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material and puried using aspin column in accordance with the manufacturers instructions (Zymo Re-search, Orange, CA). The 182-bp probe H5 consisted of DNA upstream of theH3 probe from coordinates 1714573 to 1714754, and the lacZ probe consisted of 152 bp amplied from the lacZ gene using the primers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Competition assays were performed under the bind-TABLE 1.

Thermal, osmotic, and acid stress assays. Stress assays were performed as described previously, using shaking broth cultures grown to stationary phase (39,5254). The data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of fourindependent experiments each plated in triplicate. Tissue culture invasion and intracellular survival assays. Invasion of Int407 intestinal epithelial cells and survival in J774 macrophages were assayed asdescribed previously with a multiplicity of infection of approximately 30 usinglate-log-phase broth shaking cultures (4952, 54). The data (see Fig. 7) are fromfour to six independent experiments each performed in triplicate tissue culturewells, except for the pBAD18 H11001lacZ strains, which are from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Biolm formation. Strain H92733339 containing pBAD18, pBAD18 H11001ydcI,o r pBAD18 H11001lacZ was grown overnight in the absence of arabinose, diluted 1:50 in fresh medium, grown to an OD 600of approximately 0.6 to 0.8, supplemented with arabinose to 0.1, and grown for an additional 12 to 16 h. Crystal violet staining of biolms and subsequent quantitation were performed as described previously(9, 43). Low uid shear studies. To test S. Typhimurium responses to low uid shear culture, the RWV bioreactor was used to grow cultures of each strain in the lowuid shear and control orientations as described previously (references 52 and 53for acid stress and reference 54 for oxidative stress). The cultures were subjectedto acid stress (pH 3.5 with citric acid) and oxidative stress (70 mM H 2O2) and assayed for survival as described previously (references 52 and 53 for acid stress and 54 for oxidative stress). The results are from three to six independent RWVexperiments each plated in triplicate. RESULTS The S. Typhimurium ydcI gene encodes a conserved pro- tein. We used the S. Typhimurium YdcI protein sequence (GenBank accession no. AAL20543) as a query in a BLASTsearch for homologs in the protein database. The results of thissearch indicated that the YdcI protein sequence belongs to theLysR family of transcriptional regulators and is highly con-served among Gram-negative genomes, including the generaEscherichia ,Shigella ,Citrobacter ,Enterobacter ,Klebsiella , and Serratia (Fig. 1). The e values for the alignments in Fig. 1 are all less than 10 H11002140, except that for the Serratia protein, which is 10H1100292. We also found that the YdcI protein is encoded by Ralstonia ,Pseudomonas ,Burkholderia ,Rhizobium ,Agrobacte- rium ,Brucella , and Ruegeria at a somewhat lower level of homology (e values between 10H1100271and 10H1100249) but still repre - senting a high degree of conservation in these genera (see Fig.S1 in the supplemental material). The genomic organization ofthe location of the ydcI gene in the genera from Fig. 1 is also conserved (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Theseresults indicate that the ydcI gene is conserved across multiple Gram-negative genera and suggest evolutionary selection forthe function of this gene in prokaryotic biology. Analysis of ydcI gene expression. To test if the ydcI gene is expressed in different bacterial genera, we isolated total RNAfrom cultures of S. Typhimurium, Salmonella Typhi, Proteus mirabilis ,Serratia marcescens ,Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Cit- robacter koseri and performed an RT-PCR analysis using prim- ers against the ydcI homolog in each strain. We detected ydcI homolog expression via this assay indicating that this gene isable to be transcribed across genera (Fig. 2). To further ana-lyze ydcI gene expression, we constructed lacZ transcriptional fusions in the chromosomal copy of the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene. Two such fusions were constructed; the WT ydcI::lacZ andH9004ydcI::lacZ alleles contain the promoterless lacZ gene fused immediately after the ydcI stop codon and at nucleotide166 of the 912-bp ydcI gene, respectively (Fig. 3A). The latter construct is predicted to abolish normal YdcI protein function,thereby allowing comparison of lacZ reporter expression in the presence and absence of WT YdcI protein. We found thatthe WT ydcI::lacZ fusion was expressed 3-fold less than the H9004ydcI::lacZ construct (Fig. 3B). We introduced a plasmid ex- pressing the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene from an arabinose- inducible promoter (pBAD18 H11001ydcI) into the H9004ydcI::lacZ mu- tant strain. In the presence of arabinose, this strain expressedsignicantly less lacZ than the control strain containing the vector only (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results indicate thatthe YdcI protein negatively autoregulates its expression underthe conditions tested here and is expressed at relatively lowlevels when this autoregulation is intact. Purication and DNA binding activity of YdcI protein. To test the YdcI protein for DNA binding activity, we cloned theS. Typhimurium ydcI gene downstream of an arabinose-induc- ible promoter on the plasmid vector pBAD18 (24). In thisconstruct, we also fused the coding sequence for a six-histidineepitope immediately after the last codon such that the YdcIprotein would be expressed with a C-terminal tag. Arabinose-dependent expression of the YdcI protein was demonstratedvia Western blot analysis, and we then puried the fusionprotein using nickel agarose columns (see Fig. S3 in the sup-plemental material). To test the DNA binding activity of YdcI,we incubated YdcI protein from either cell extracts or puriedpreparations with a 180-bp DNA probe (named H3) consistingof the sequence immediately upstream of the S. Typhimurium ydcI ORF as indicated in Materials and Methods. Both sources of YdcI protein shifted the labeled H3 probe in this assay (Fig.4A). To test the specicity of the YdcI DNA binding activity,we used a 152-bp probe consisting of lacZ gene DNA, and YdcI did not shift this probe (Fig. 4B). In addition, we alsosynthesized a 182-bp probe (named H5) consisting of DNAfrom the ydcI promoter region that extends immediately up- stream of the H3 probe and show that YdcI does not shift thisprobe (Fig. 4B). We also incubated gel shift reaction mixtureswith an excess of unlabeled ydcI promoter fragment H3 (spe- cic competitor) or unlabeled lacZ fragment (nonspecic com- petitor). The results are consistent with a specic YdcI DNAbinding activity since the specic competitor abolished binding to the probe and the nonspecic competitor did not (Fig. 4C).Since YdcI is a DNA binding protein that has not been previ-ously characterized, we used the gel shift assay to determine anapparent dissociation constant ( K D) for the YdcI binding ac - tivity. The concentration of YdcI protein at which 50 bindingoccurred (and thus indicated the apparent K Dunder these conditions) was approximately 2.3 to 4.6 nM (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). This magnitude of apparent KDis consistent with documented specic DNA binding activity of members of this protein family (34, 44, 47) and is consistentwith the conclusion that the ydcI gene encodes a specic DNA binding protein. Since our results indicated that a YdcI DNA binding site is located within the H3 probe, we used the Microfootprinterprogram (http:bio.cs.washington.eduMicroFootPrinter.html)to identify possible YdcI binding sites within the H3 fragment(37). This analysis yielded two candidate sites in the H3 frag-ment, but two separate 40-bp probes containing each site did2210 JENNINGS ET AL. J. B ACTERIOL .not display binding to YdcI protein in the gel shift assay (data not shown). Stress assays reveal an acid resistance defect in an S. Ty- phimurium ydcI mutant. In order to study the role of the ydcI gene in Salmonella biology, we constructed a knockout muta- tion of the ydcI gene in the chromosome of S. Typhimurium using the lambda Red recombination system (see Materialsand Methods for details). We observed no signicant growthdifferences between the WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains using OD 600and CFU measurements in a growth curve (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). Since the ydcI gene was initiallybrought to our attention as a member of a stimulon of genes that change expression under conditions that alter bacterialstress resistance, we tested the ydcI mutant for osmotic, ther- mal, oxidative, and acid stress resistance compared to that ofthe isogenic WT strain. Under conditions of osmotic and ther-mal stress, we did not observe a signicant difference in sur-vival between the WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains (Fig. 5). Under conditions of oxidative stress, we observed inconsistent resultsthat may indicate a survival defect under these conditions oftheH9004ydcI mutant compared to the WT, but this experiment requires further study to determine a conclusive effect (data FIG. 1. Alignment of the S. Typhimurium YdcI protein with homologs present in a range of other Gram-negative genera. Yellow highlighting indicates amino acid identity (in at least ve of the proteins). The e values for the aligned proteins are less than 10H11002140, except for the Serratia protein, whose e value is 10H1100292.VOL. 193, 2011 CHARACTERIZATION OF S. TYPHIMURIUM ydcI GENE 2211not shown). However, under both organic (citric acid) and inorganic (HCl) acid stress (pH 3.5), we observed a signicantdifference between the survival of the H9004ydcI mutant and that of the WT strain (Fig. 5). Both the organic and inorganic acidresistance defects can be complemented by a functional copyofydcI provided on a plasmid (Fig. 5). These data indicate that theydcI gene is required for full acid stress resistance of S. Typhimurium under the conditions studied here and likelyexpresses a protein that serves to regulate genes involved inacid stress resistance.Relationship between the ydcI and rpoS genes. The S. Ty- phimurium rpoS gene encodes a highly conserved sigma factor that is required for the expression of a wide array of genesinvolved in resistance to a range of environmental stresses andhas been termed the master regulator of bacterial stressresistance (16, 26, 29). Since the ydcI gene is required for full FIG. 2. RT-PCR of ydcI gene homologs in a range of Gram-nega- tive genera.

The maps of the WT, H9004ydcI::lacZ , and WT ydcI::lacZ gene loci in the S. Typhimurium strain genomes are shown. (B) The LacZ activity of the strains in panel A is shown. In addition, the H9004ydcI::lacZ strain was transformed with either pBAD18 or pBAD18 H11001ydcI and assayed for LacZ activity in the presence or absence of arabinose. FIG. 4.

The percentsurvival of the WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains under the corresponding stress (compared to before addition of stress) was calculated, and aratio of the percent survival of the indicated H9004ydcI mutant test strain to that of the WT strain is shown.

Typhimurium, we compared the phenotype of an S. Typhimurium H9004ydcIH9004rpoS double mutant to that of the H9004ydcI andH9004rpoS single mutants to distinguish between the possibilities that ydcI and rpoS are part of the same pathway or part of separate, additive pathways. In thecitric acid resistance assay, we observed that the H9004rpoS mutant displayed high sensitivity within 30 min, but the H9004ydcI mutant did not display its sensitivity until 120 min after the addition ofstress (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6A). Thus, within 30 min of citric acidstress exposure, the H9004ydcI and WT strains display similar phe- notypes (Fig. 6A). However, the H9004ydcIH9004rpoS double mutant displayed a citric acid resistance defect that was identical tothat of the H9004rpoS single mutant (Fig. 6A). In the HCl acid resistance assay, both the H9004ydcI andH9004rpoS single mutants display high sensitivity within 30 min of acid exposure, but theH9004rpoS mutant is signicantly more sensitive than the H9004ydcI mutant during this time (Fig. 6A). The H9004ydcIH9004rpoS double mutant displayed an HCl acid resistance defect identical tothat of the H9004rpoS single mutant. These results suggest that the ydcI andrpoS genes act via the same pathway and do not act in an additive manner in separate pathways to provide WT levelsof acid resistance. To test if rpoS plays a role in the expression of the ydcI gene, we constructed a WT ydcI::lacZH9004rpoS strain and compared the LacZ activity of this strain to that of the WT ydcI::lacZ strain. Remarkably, the WT ydcI::lacZH9004rpoS strain completely lost LacZ activity, in contrast to the control (Fig. 6B). A controlstrain in which the same lacZ reporter gene was driven by the Cm r-encoding gene promoter was not affected by the presence of theH9004rpoS mutation (Fig. 6B). To demonstrate that the loss of WT ydcI::lacZ activity was not due to a random artifact of strain construction, we restored the WT rpoS allele to the WT ydcI::lacZH9004rpoS strain using P22 transduction of a Cmrmarker linked to the WT rpoS allele as described in Materials and Methods. This strain displayed WT levels of WT ydcI::lacZ activity, in contrast to the control, conrming that the H9004rpoS mutation was responsible for the expression defect (Fig. 6B).Taken together, the double mutant studies and lacZ reporter analysis provide signicant evidence that the ydcI gene is part of the rpoS regulon in S. Typhimurium. Tissue culture invasion assays. To test for a role for ydcI in S. Typhimurium invasion of cultured intestinal epithelial cells, we compared the H9004ydcI mutant strain to the WT for entry into Int407 cells. The results indicated that the H9004ydcI mutant did not differ signicantly from the WT in Int407 invasion (Fig.7A). However, we also tested the invasion phenotype of strainsin which ydcI expression had been induced or turned on as an alternative to analysis of the deletion mutant (in which thegene is removed). Since expression of the ydcI gene from the pBAD18 H11001ydcI construct restored the repression of a chromo- somal H9004ydcI::lacZ fusion to WT levels, expressed a protein displaying specic DNA binding activity as predicted, and com- plemented the H9004ydcI acid resistance defect back to WT levels, we reasoned that this construct would be an appropriate reagent for FIG. 6. Relationship between ydcI and rpoS genes. (A) The indicated strains were subjected to acid stress (pH 3.5) with citric acid or HCl as indicated over a 30-min time period. The percent survival of the strains (compared to before the addition of stress) was calculated, and a ratio ofthe percent survival of the test strain to the WT strain is shown. Note that the phenotype of the H9004ydcI mutant is similar to the WT for citric acid stress within 30 min (the data in Fig. 5 are from 120 min of acid stress). The Pvalues were calculated as comparisons of the indicated strains and theH9004ydcI single mutant strain. (B) Cultures of the indicated strains were assayed for LacZ activity and plotted for Miller units. All strains are in theH92733339 background, as indicated in Table 1. Cm:: lacZ indicates that the lacZ gene in this strain is transcribed via the Cm rgene promoter. STM2901::Cm indicates the gene location of a Cmrmarker linked to the WT rpoS gene within approximately 20 kb of DNA in the S. Typhimurium genome.VOL. 193, 2011 CHARACTERIZATION OF S. TYPHIMURIUM ydcI GENE 2213this purpose. WT strain H92733339 containing pBAD18 H11001ydcI invaded Int407 cells to a level 2.8 times higher than that of controls in thepresence of arabinose (Fig. 7A). Control strains containing thepBAD18 vector alone or pBAD18 H11001lacZ did not display in- creased cell entry in either the presence or the absence of arabi-nose (Fig. 7A). The latter strain expresses copious amounts ofLacZ protein (several thousand Miller units) in the presence ofarabinose (reference 42 and data not shown). This indicates thatthis phenotype is specic to ydcI induction and not merely due to general overexpression of protein in this strain. The pBAD18 andpBAD18 H11001ydcI strains displayed virtually identical levels of ad- herence to Int407 cells under these conditions (see Fig. S6 in thesupplemental material). The SPI-1 genes encode a type III secre-tion system used to facilitate invasion of nonphagocytic cells likethose of the Int407 line (1820). To test if induction of ydcI could serve to reverse the invasion defect of the H9004SPI-1 strain, we introduced the pBAD18 H11001ydcI plasmid into this strain, induced ydcI expression via arabinose, and tested invasion of the culture. We did not observe any reversal of the H9004SPI-1 invasion defect under these conditions compared to the control strain containingthe vector alone (Fig. 7A). This may suggest that the increasedinvasion upon ydcI induction in the WT strain background occurs via the SPI-1 pathway. We also tested if the H9004ydcI mutation or induction of ydcI expression had any effect on S. Typhimurium survival in J774 macrophages. Neither the deletion nor the induction of theydcI gene had any effect on S. Typhimurium macrophage sur- vival (Fig. 7B). Biolm formation. When cultures of strain H92733339 contain- ing pBAD18 or pBAD18 H11001ydcI were supplemented with ar- abinose and allowed to grow for approximately 12 to 16 hpostsupplementation, we observed that the strain containingpBAD18 H11001ydcI formed a biolm which was especially promi-nent at the medium-air interface (Fig. 8A). This biolm was readily stained with crystal violet, indicating signicant celladhesion (Fig. 8A), and this observation was conrmed viamicroscopy (data not shown). Biolm staining was readily ob-served in areas below the medium-air interface, suggesting thatbiolm-mediated adhesion was not dependent on the interface(Fig. 8A). The control strain containing pBAD18 did not forma biolm after arabinose supplementation (Fig. 8A). In addi- tion, both strains did not form a biolm under the same growthconditions in the absence of arabinose (data not shown). Toconrm that biolm formation was not the result of generalprotein expression from the pBAD18 arabinose-inducible pro-moter, we performed the same assay with strain H92733339 con- taining pBAD18 H11001lacZ . This strain had a phenotype identical to that of the pBAD18 control and did not form a biolm uponarabinose supplementation (Fig. 8B). Quantitation of crystalviolet staining of the biolm conrmed the qualitative differ-ences observed between the strains in Fig. 8 (see Fig. S7 in thesupplemental material). Low uid shear studies. To test if the ydcI gene plays a role in transmission of the low uid shear environmental signal in S. Typhimurium, we tested both the WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains for two separate phenotypes induced by low uid shear growthin the RWV apparatus. Previous studies have established thatlow uid shear conditions alter the acid and oxidative stressresistance proles of WT S. Typhimurium (39, 41, 5255). We grew cultures of the WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains under low uid shear and control conditions in the RWV and subjectedthese cultures to separate acid (pH 3.5 using citric acid) andoxidative (70 mM H 2O2) stresses. In both tests, the H9004ydcI mutant strain displayed the same low uid shear-induced phe- notype as the WT strain (Fig. 9). This indicates that the ydcI FIG. 7. Invasion of Int407 cells and survival in J774 macrophages. (A) The indicated S. Typhimurium strains were tested for invasion of Int407 cells via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of percent invasion of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. The H9004SPI-1 strain contains a deletion of the SPI-1 genes required for full invasion of Int407 cells. The H9004SPI-1 and H9004ydcI mutant strains were compared to the WT for ratio calculation. The pBAD18, pBAD18 H11001ydcI, and pBAD18 H11001lacZ strains were compared to the WT pBAD18 strain under the corresponding arabinose condition for ratio calculation. (B) The indicated strains were tested for survival in J774 macrophages over a period of18 to 20 h via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of the percent survival of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. Forratio calculations, the H9004ydcI mutant strain was compared to the WT and the pBAD18 H11001ydcI strain was compared to the pBAD18 strain.2214 JENNINGS ET AL. J. B ACTERIOL .gene is not required for these low uid shear responses in S. Typhimurium under these conditions. DISCUSSION Growth conditions such as spaceight and RWV culture that are characterized by low uid shear force have been shown toincrease bacterial virulence (39, 52, 53). In addition, an array of other phenotypes is induced or altered via this growth envi-ronment (6, 7, 40, 41). Interestingly, these uid shear levels arerelevant to those encountered by certain pathogens in thehuman host during the course of infection (23, 36, 40, 41).However, this environmental cue is not well characterized, anda number of uncharacterized genes with unknown function arepart of a stimulon associated with low uid shear force (7, 52,53, 55). Unexplored genes with potentially important, observ-able roles in prokaryotic biology could be part of this stimulon,but they may not have been previously analyzed because theyhave not been identied as part of any established regulatorynetworks or phenotypes. One such gene, S. Typhimurium ydcI, was discovered to be a member of the S. Typhimurium low uid shear stimulon and has been predicted be homologous tothe LysR family of transcriptional regulators (54, 55). How-ever, the ydcI gene was previously uncharacterized before this study. The goals of this study were to characterize the S. Typhimu- rium ydcI gene for a role in bacterial biology and to analyze the DNA binding activity of the YdcI protein. In this report, wedemonstrate that the ydcI gene (i) is conserved in a range of Gram-negative bacteria, (ii) is expressed in S. Typhimurium and other Gram-negative species, (iii) is autorepressed in S. Typhimurium, (iv) encodes a DNA binding protein that bindsspecically to a probe from the ydcI promoter, (v) is required for full resistance of S. Typhimurium to acid stress, (vi) is part of the rpoS regulon, (vii) can increase S. Typhimurium invasion of intestinal epithelial cells when induced, and (viii) can cause FIG. 8. Induction of ydcI expression results in S. Typhimurium biolm formation. (A) S. Typhimurium strain H92733339 containing either pBAD18 or pBAD18 H11001ydcI was grown in the presence of arabinose for approximately 16 h in LB medium. The white arrow indicates signicant biolm accumulation at the medium-air interface. The upper and lower panels show culture appearance and crystal violet-stained asks (with culturesremoved), respectively. (B) The same as panel A, except that strain H92733339 containing pBAD18 H11001lacZ was tested. FIG. 9. Low uid shear phenotypes of WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains via RWV culture. The S. Typhimurium WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains were grown in the RWV apparatus in low uid shear (LFS) orcontrol conditions, and the cultures were tested for acid stress resis-tance (pH 3.5 with citric acid) or oxidative stress resistance (70 mMH 2O2) in separate assays. The percent survival of the WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains for each culture condition in each stress was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of each sample to the controlcondition for each stress is shown. Low uid shear culture alters stressresistance compared to the control for both the WT and H9004ydcI mutant strains.V OL. 193, 2011 CHARACTERIZATION OF S. TYPHIMURIUM ydcI GENE 2215biolm formation in S. Typhimurium when induced. These results indicate that the ydcI gene likely serves as a DNA binding transcriptional regulator that regulates genes involvedin aspects of bacterial biology, including stress resistance andpossibly virulence. A major goal in the future study of ydcI will be to identify the genes that are members of a potential YdcIregulon to understand how genes regulated by YdcI arelinked to stress resistance, host cell interactions, biolm for-mation, and other prokaryotic functions. In addition, futurestudies will focus on determining if ydcI has a role in the transmission of the low uid shear environmental cue to bac-terial cells beyond the experiments performed here. Thoughthe results of Fig. 9 show that the ydcI gene is not required for the low uid shear phenotypes tested as part of this study, thisgene may be involved in other low uid shear responses not yettested (including in other species beyond S. Typhimurium). Expression of the ydcI gene is upregulated by low uid shear growth conditions (54, 55). Interestingly, though the ydcI gene is clearly expressed in bacteria under standard culture con-ditions, the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene appears to be repressed and expressed at relatively low levels under these conditions.One intriguing possibility is that ydcI is expressed at a certain level under one set of conditions and is then upregulated by anenvironmental signal(s) to induce adaptive cellular changes foranother set of conditions. As indicated by our data, thesechanges could include altering resistance to stresses, interac-tions with host cells, or physiology related to biolm formation.Whether these changes function to adapt S. Typhimurium or other bacteria for their roles as pathogens remains to be de-termined with future studies. However, our data suggest that,at a minimum, the ydcI gene likely regulates genes with the potential for involvement in functions related to stress resis-tance, growthsurvival, and possibly virulence. The observationthat ydcI expression involves the RpoS sigma factor provides support to this hypothesis since RpoS controls the expressionof a regulon of genes involved in stress resistance and virulence(16, 26, 29, 38). However, we have previously reported thatRpoS is not required for a range of low uid shear responsesinS. Typhimurium (54). Therefore, a possible scheme for the regulation of ydcI expression is that RpoS is used for expres- sion under certain conditions and another (yet to be identied)pathway is used for expression under other conditions (such aslow uid shear). Future studies will be aimed at determininghow ydcI gene regulation ts into regulatory schemes in a range of bacteria. This is the rst report to demonstrate DNA binding activity of the YdcI protein. We show that both (i) extracts containingYdcI protein and (ii) puried YdcI protein are able to bind aDNA probe (from the S. Typhimurium ydcI promoter region) in a specic manner. The YdcI DNA binding activity displaysan apparent dissociation constant with a value consistent withspecic DNA binding proteins with biologic functions and con-sistent with other members of LysR family (to which YdcIbelongs) (34, 44, 47). Induced expression of the YdcI proteinrepressed an S. Typhimurium ydcI::lacZ fusion and comple- mented the acid resistance defect of an S. Typhimurium H9004ydcI mutant. These observations suggest that the YdcI DNA bind-ing activity functions in bacterial cells to affect physiologicalchanges. Future studies will be aimed at determining (i) thespecic DNA site that is recognized by YdcI, (ii) the genesassociated with YdcI binding sites, and (iii) whether these sites are used by YdcI in other bacterial species. We identiedpotential binding sites within the H3 probe fragment, butsmaller DNA fragments containing these individual sites didnot display YdcI binding activity. Identication of the actualYdcI binding site will require additional, systematic study thatis beyond the scope of this report. However, this report pro-vides a foundation for analyzing the previously uncharacter-ized YdcI DNA binding activity via a number of approaches. Though induced ydcI expression affects S. Typhimurium in- testinal epithelial cell invasion and biolm formation, we donot know how the YdcI protein functions in these phenotypes.We demonstrate that the host cell interaction phenotype onlyaffects the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and not survivalin macrophages. One possibility for this may be that ydcI can alter the expression of genes involved in SPI-1 type III secre-tion-mediated invasion of nonphagocytic cells or other genesinvolved in specic interactions with epithelial cells. Indeed,the induction of ydcI did not increase invasion by a H9004SPI-1 strain, suggesting that ydcI possibly acts through the SPI-1 pathway for increased invasion. We tested a SPI-1 invI::lacZ fusion for altered expression in the presence of pBAD18 H11001ydcI and found that ydcI induction produced a 7.1-fold decrease in reporter expression (data not shown). This indicates that YdcImay potentially alter SPI-1 gene expression as part of its func-tion, but how YdcI would do this in the context of the manydifferent SPI-1 genes and the other regulators of SPI-1 geneexpression remains to be determined. Systematic identicationof the genes regulated by YdcI and elucidation of how YdcIcontrols these genes as part of an overall regulatory schemewill require further controlled study. Biolm formation in Sal- monella spp. appears to be a complex process and has been shown to involve a number of different genes involved in a-gella and curli ber formation, cellulose production, and O-antigen synthesis (8, 9, 27, 28, 31). In addition, there are likelyat least two different types of biolms formed by Salmonella spp. that are utilized on either cholesterol-rich surfaces (likegallstones) or on material surfaces like glass or plastic (8, 9).We do not know how ydcI affects Salmonella genes involved in biolm formation, but studies aimed at determining the natureof the ydcI-induced biolm and the genes involved in this process are currently being pursued.
