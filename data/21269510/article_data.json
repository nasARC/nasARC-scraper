Background Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) regulate diverse processes in eukary otic cells including signal transduction, cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organizationand intracellular membrane trafficking. GTPases areactivated by GTP binding and inactivated by subsequenthydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thus acting as mole-cular switches in these processes 1,2. The Rab GTPasefamily is the largest and most complex within the Rasprotein superfamily. Rab GTPases are important regula-tors of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling processes in eukar- yotic cells 3-6. Rab GTPase functions have been exten-sively studied in yeast and mammalian systems. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that different Rab proteins function in distinct intracellularmembrane trafficking steps and they are hypothesized towork together with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins to promote specificity of vesicle transport to target com-partments and facilitate ve sicle and target membrane fusion 7-13. They are therefore essential for the trans-port of proteins and membrane through the endomem-brane system to their destination. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 93 putative Ras superfamily proteins. Fifty-seven of these are RabGTPases, more than in yeast but similar to the numberin humans 13,14. According to their sequence similar-ity and phylogenetic clustering with yeast and mamma- lian orthologs, these Rab proteins were assigned to eight subfamilies, AtRabA to AtRabH, which can be furtherdivided into 18 subclasses 13. Relatively few of theplant Rab orthologs have been investigated functionally.Most of these studies have used constitutively active(CA) andor dominant negative (DN) mutations, gener-ated by direct mutation of the conserved domain torestrict mutant GTPase proteins to the active GTP- bound form (constitutively active) or inactive GDP- bound form (dominant negative).

For anumber of plant Rab GTPases, expression of their CAand DN mutants in transformed plants, together withprotein localization information, has shown that theseRabs perform functions similar to those of their yeast and mammalian orthologs 15-19. Several reports indicate t hat Rab proteins are impor- tant for elongation of tip-growing cells in plants. For example, AtRabA4b is reported to localize to the tips ofroot hair cells and was proposed to regulate membranetrafficking through a compartment involved in thepolarized secretion of cell wall components 18. NtRab2GTPase is important for trafficking between the endo- plasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies in tobacco pollen tubes and may be specialized to optimally support thehigh secretory demands in these tip growing cells 16.NtRabA (Rab11) in tobacco i s predominantly localized to an inverted cone-shaped region at the pollen tube tip,and both constitutively active and dominant negativemutants resulted in reduced tube growth rate, meander-ing pollen tubes, and reduced male fertility 20. There are four genes in the Arabidopsis RabD subfam- ily, AtRabD1 (At3g11730), AtRabD2a (At1g02130, AtRab1b), AtRabD2b (At5g47200, AtRab1a) and AtRabD2c (At4g17530, AtRab1c) 13. In mammals, the orthologs of AtRabD, Rab1 isoforms, physically associatewith the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment andGolgi and regulate membrane trafficking between theER and Golgi complex 21. Fluorescent protein fusions with AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b localize to the Golgi and trans -Golgi network 22,23, and transient expression in plant cells of dominant negative mutantsofrabD2a orrabD1 resulted in the inhibition of ER-to- Golgi trafficking 15,22,24, suggesting a related functionfor the plant Rab1 homologs. Pinheiro et al. 22 isolatedT-DNA insertion mutants in each of the AtRabD familygenes and reported that each of the single and double mutants lacked a detectable phenotype. By contrast, a rabD2a rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant was lethal and a rabD1 rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant had stunted growth and low fertility, indicating that these gene family mem-bers perform important and overlapping functions. We previously hypothesized that closely related genes with a high Pearson correlation in their RNAaccumulation level are functionally redundant, and showed that expression patterns of both the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes are negatively correlated with the process of starch synthesis 25, whereas the expression patterns of the remaining RabD genes are not. We therefore predicted that these two Rab proteins mayhave redundant functions that are not shared by theother two AtRabD family members. Here we show thatAtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated in theirRNA accumulation level across a variety of experimen-tal conditions. Phenotypic analysis of knockoutmutants indicates that they are at least partially func-tionally redundant, and are important in pollen devel-opment and pollen tube growth. The proteins bothlocalize to the trans -Golgi, consistent with their pro- posed role in trafficking from the ER to the Golgiapparatus. Results The expression patterns of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are closely correlated The four RabD family members in Arabidopsis shareabout 88 identity at the amino acid level. The accu- mulation pattern of the associ ated transcripts is quite distinct across a wide variety of experimental condi- tions and developmental stages (MetaOmGraph, http:www.metnetdb.orgMetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm; 26)(Table 1; Additional file 1, Table S1). AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c expression patterns are correlated (at a Pearson correlation value of 0.72), whereas AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a show very low correlation with the others (Pearson correlati on value of  0.20). Based on their high sequence similarity (99 amino acid iden-tity) and the correlation between their mRNA accumu-lation patterns, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b andAtRabD2c might have some functional overlap that isnot shared by AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a. Identification of Null Mutations in the Genes AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c It was reported previously that an AtrabD2b AtrabD2c double mutant has no phenotype 22. Based on ourcorrelation analysis above, we hypothesized that thismutant may have some more subtle defects that cannotbe compensated for by the remaining family members.To investigate this further, we identified T-DNA inser-tion mutants (Figure 1A) in AtrabD2b (3 alleles) and AtrabD2c (1 allele). Homozygous lines for the T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR, using primersselected by iSct primers (http: signal.salk.edutdnapri- mers.2.html), and the insertion sites were determined bysequencing the PCR products (Figure 1B). Analysis ofmRNA levels by RT-PCR indicated that AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 are null mutants. However, Table 1 Pearson correlation between expression patterns of AtRabD family members AtRabD1 AtRabD2a AtRabD2b AtRabD2c AtRabD1 100 AtRabD2a 17.08 100 AtRabD2b -3.4 22.19 100 AtRabD2c 15.92 25.23 77.81 100Peng et al .BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:25 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-22291125Page 2 of 16theAtrabD2b-3 mutation had no effect on AtRabD2b RNA accumulation (Figure 1C and data not shown). Progeny from AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1 heterozy- gotes showed a T-DNA segregation ratio of approxi- mately 3:1 based on kanamycin resistance, consistent with a single insertion.

To generate AtrabD2b AtrabD2c dou- ble mutants, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 homozygoussingle mutants were crossed, F1 plants were allowed toself fertilize and the AtrabD2b-2AtrabD2c-1 double mutant was identified from the F2 population by PCRusing the primers for both AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 . Hereafter, the AtrabD2b-2AtrabD2c-1 double mutant will be referred to as AtrabD2b2c , and AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 single mutants will be referred to as AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c respectively. Siliques Are Shorter in the AtrabD2b2c Double Mutant than in Either Single Mutant or in Wild-Type Lines To evaluate phenotypes associated with the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, homozygous AtrabD2b (three alleles, AtrabD2b-1 ,AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2b-3 ), AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b2c mutants, along with wild- type siblings, were grown on agar plates with or without various hormone, nutrient and light treatments. Wetested over 50 of the conditions described in the Gantletwebsite (http:www.gantlet.org); however, no significantphenotypic differences were observed in the seedlings forany of the mutant alleles (data not shown). In addition,we tested the seedling phenotype on media with or with- out sucrose or vitamin B5 and , consistent with previous reports 22, no obvious phenotypes were observed. By contrast, AtrabD2b2c double mutant lines showed a phenotype associated with reproduction. In these lines, siliques were shorter when grown eitherunder continuous light or long day (16h light8h dark)conditions. Neither the AtrabD2b nor the AtrabD2c single mutant alleles displayed a short silique pheno- type. The length of AtrabD2b2c siliques was 70 of that of wild-type, AtrabD2b orAtrabD2c single mutant lines (Figure 2; P  0.01 by Student st-test). To evalu- ate whether this reduced silique size is associated with a seed defect, siliques from AtrabD2b2c, wild-type, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant lines were opened at 10 DAF (days after flowering). Consistently, no defectsin the seeds of either AtrabD2b orAtrabD2c single mutants were observed. However, approximately halfof the ovules in the AtrabD2b2c double mutant were not fertilized (Figure 3). Co nsistent with this observa- tion, the AtrabD2b2c mutant plants produced a smal- ler quantity of seeds than wild-type plants or singlemutants (Figure 3; Additional file 2, Figure S1). Theseresults are consistent with a functional overlapbetween AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c that cannot be ful- filled by AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a. Complementation of AtrabD2b2c Mutant Phenotype To demonstrate that the AtrabD2b2c mutant phenotype is due to the mutations in the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, constructs containing either AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c , each expressed from their native promoter, were introduced into the AtrabD2b2c double mutant.AtRabD2c 2060bpAtRabD2b 2055bp100bp ATGTAAATG TGA AtrabD2b-2AtrabD2b-1 AtrabD2b-3 AtrabD2c-1A M MB Col-0 AtrabD2c AtrabD2b AtrabD2b2c AtRabD2c AtRabD2b Tubulin CCol-0 AtrabD2c AtrabD2b 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4AtrabD2b2c100bp Figure 1 Characterization of AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutations .

AtrabD2b2c ,AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c Pollen Have Defects in Morphology and Pollen Tube Elongation Two possibilities could explain the unfertilized embryosseen in the AtrabD2b2c double mutants. One possibi- lity is that the pollen bears a defect that leads to pollensterility and inability to fertilize the embryos. Alterna-tively, ovules may bear an abnormality such that their fertilization is reduced. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we obser ved the pollen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All of the pollen from wild- type plants looked normal, whereas more than 20 oftheAtrabD2b2c pollen exhibited an irregular, collapsed morphology (Figure 5A). We also observed that someabnormal pollen grains from the AtrabD2b2c double mutant were devoid of nuclei, as indicated by DAPI staining, whereas all pollen from wild-type (Figure 5B) a n ds i n g l em u t a n tp l a n t s( d a t an o ts h o w n )h a v en u c l e i .This defective pollen may be the severely collapsedpollen visualized under the SEM. Surprisingly, even theAtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutant lines produce aberrant pollen at a level of about 10. This is unex-pected, as the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have normal-appearing siliques and seed quantities simi-lar to the wild-type plants. A likely explanation is that there are sufficient normal pollen grains in the single mutants to efficiently fertilize the ovaries in theAtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants. We originally identified AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c because the transcript accumulation patterns of thesetwo genes correlate with those of many genes associatedwith starch metabolism. Indeed, the AtrabD2b2c double mutant pollen stained less intensely with IKI than wild- type pollen (Figure 5C), suggesting a decreased starch content in the AtrabD2b2c mutant pollen. This is con- sistent with the expression correlation, although the rea-son for this phenotype is unclear. A single flower of Arabidopsis produces thousands of pollen grains, but usually there are less than 100embryos in one silique. If only 20 of the pollen grainsare abnormal, we would not expect the strikingly reduced fertility seen in the AtrabD2b2c double mutant. We therefore looked for additional explanations for the reduced fertility. To evaluate germination and Figure 3 There are many non-fertilized ovaries in the AtrabD2b2c double mutant . Individual siliques of wild type, single and double mutant plants were dissected and examined under the microscope. Arrows heads indicate unfertilized ovaries.

After overnight incubation, almost all of the pollen from wild-type plants germinated and showed atypical tip growth. However, about 10 of the pollen from the AtrabD2b2c mutant did not germinate at all and 50 of the pollen germinated but did not grow api- cally as did pollen of wild-type plants (Figure 6A and6B). Instead, these pollen tubes were shorter and hadswollen tips, some burst ( 5), and others branched (2; Figure 6A,B and 6D). The germination rate of the pollen from the single mutants was similar to the wild-type pollen. However, approximately 20 of the germi- nating pollen also had swolle nt i p s( F i g u r e6 Aa n d6 B ) , although the phenotype was not as severe as the AtrabD2b2c double mutant; burst or branched tubes were never observed in either single mutant (Figure 6Aand 6B). Moreover, the pollen tubes of the AtrabD2b2c double mutant were much shorter than those of wild-type plants or either single mutant (P  0.01), and thesingle mutants had shorter pollen tubes than wild-typeplants (Figure 6E; P  0.01 for both mutants). Eventhough the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants had collapsed pollen, shorter pol len tubes and swollen tips, their siliques were normal compared with wild-typeplants. We hypothesize that the single mutants may stillhave sufficient normal pollen to enable all embryos tobe fertilized. The in vitro pollen germination phenotypes were confirmed by analyzing pollen tube growth after in vivo pollination (Figure 6C). Open flowers from wild- type or AtrabD2b2c mutant plants were incubated overnight on agar medium. The AtrabD2b2c mutant flowers had reduced pollen germination and decreasedpollen tube length compared with wild-type plants, sug-gesting that pollen germination and pollen tube growthmay also be defective in vivo. Pollen and Pollen Tube Defects Cause the Shorter Siliques in the AtrabD2b2c Mutant To investigate whether the unfertilized seeds are due to the observed pollen abnormality, or whether the ovaryalso has defects that might contribute to the reducedrate of fertilization, we crossed wild-type and AtrabD2b 2cmutant plants. If the shorter silique phenotype is borne only by the abnormal pollen, wild-type plant pol-len should rescue the AtrabD2b2c mutant silique phe- notype to a normal length (AtrabD2b2c mutant female flower crossed with wild-type plant pollen). In contrast,the AtrabD2b2c mutant plant pollen crossed with a wild-type female would mimic the mutant phenotype ofdecreased fertilization (wild-type female flower crossedwith AtrabD2b2c mutant pollen). Alternatively, if the ovary also has some abnormality, wild-type pollenwould not completely rescue the mutant phenotype, andAtrabD2b2c mutant pollen would not mimic the mutant phenotype. The results of these crosses indicatedthat pollen from wild-type plants can rescue theAtrabD2b2c short silique phenotype, and the pollen from AtrabD2b2c can bestow the shorter silique phe- notype on wild-type plants (Figures 7A and 7C). Specifi-cally, about half of the seeds were not fertilized in thesiliques that developed from wild-type pistils fertilizedbyAtrabD2b2c pollen (Figure 7B). In contrast, the sili- ques from AtrabD2b2c usually had about 50 unferti- lized ovules, but when these pistils were fertilized bywild-type pollen, all seeds looked normal, and the sili-ques were longer than those siliques in the same inflor-escence which were self-fertilized (Figures 7). Theseresults confirm that the unfertilized ovaries are mostly,if not exclusively, caused by pollen defects in theAtrabD2b2c mutant. Figure 4 Complementation of the do uble mutant phenotype .

Publicmicroarray data indicates that both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are expressed throughout development,including high expression in floral organs and particu- larly in the stamen (Figure 8; 25,26). To directly examine the spatial expression pattern of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, transgenic lines containing promoter:GFPGUS constructs for each genewere analyzed for GUS activity at various stages ofdevelopment from germination to senescence.

GUS staining further indicated that in cotyledons, rosette leaves and cauline leaves, AtRabD2b expressionwas localized predominantly in vascular tissues (Figure9B), whereas AtRabD2c was expressed ubiquitously incotyledons and in mature leaves throughout the entire leaf. Interestingly, in emerging leaves, AtRabD2c wasonly expressed in the trichomes, while AtRabD2b was not expressed in these cells (Figure 9A). In flowers,AtRabD2b was expressed in sepals, stamen and stigma,while AtRabD2c was expressed in sepal, stamen, stigmaand style (Figure 9E, F). This dichotomy of expressionsuggests that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c may functionindependently of each other in certain cells.

They bothalso showed expression in roots, but AtRabD2b was ubi-quitously expressed throughout the root, whileAtRabD2c expression was excluded from root hairs and root tips (Figure 9A-D).Subcellular localization of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c In mammals, different AtRabD orthologs (Rab1 isoforms) are localized to the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compart-ment or Golgi compartments. In plants, AtRabD2a andAtRabD2b are associated wit h the Golgi apparatus and trans -Golgi network 15,22,23,27, and we predicted that Figure 9 Temporal and spatial expression pattern of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c .

To determine the subcellular localization of AtRabD2c, GFP-AtRabD2band GFP-AtRabD2c constructs were introduced intoArabidopsis leaf protoplasts and the GFP signal wasobserved by confocal microscopy. For both constructs,GFP localized to punctuate structures, reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. To verify the identity of these structures, GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c were co-transfectedinto Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the trans -Golgi marker ST-YFP 15, and YFP and GFP signals wereobserved. Confocal results indicated that both AtRabD2band AtRabD2c primarily colocalized with ST-YFP (Figure10) and are therefore associated with the Golgi, consis-tent with a role in Golgi tra fficking. Occasionally, AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c-labeled structures were seenthat did not contain ST-YFP; these could be the post-Golgi compartments describ ed previously 22,23,27. Cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion demon-strated the absence of cross talk between GFP and YFPsignals (Additional file 3, Figure S2). Discussion Rab GTPases are critical players in the transport of materi-als through the endomembrane system, controlling exocy-t o s i so fp r o t e i n sa n dc e l lw a ll materials, endocytosis of receptors and transporters, and membrane recycling pro-cesses. Together with SNARE proteins, they promote spe-cificity of vesicle transport to target compartments,ensuring that vesicles fuse only with their appropriate tar-get and thus maintaining the distinct identity of individual organelles. Two Rab subfamilies, Rab1 (AtRabD orthologs)and Rab2 (AtRabB orthologs), have been reported to func- tion in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi inmammalian cells 21,28-34. The plant Rab1 and Rab2homologs AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and NtRab2 have alsobeen reported to function in ER to Golgi vesicle transport15,16. Here, we demonstrate a distinct physiological role for the Rab1 homologs AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen development and pollen tube growth. Using the bioinformatics tool MetaOmGraph (http: www.metnetdb.org) 25,26 to determine the pairwisePearsons correlation value between the expression pat-terns of all of the 57 AtRab genes (Additional file 1,Table S1), we found that among the four AtRabDs, onlythe expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated. From this data, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have partially redundant func-tions that are not shared by the remaining AtRabDfamily members. To test our hypothesis, we used T-DNA insertion single and double mutants to confirmthat AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have functional overlapand show that they are both required for normal pollendevelopment and tip growth of pollen tubes. We also showed that they both co-localize with the trans -Golgi marker ST-YFP, consistent with their proposed role in Golgi trafficking. The conclusion that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are partially functionally redundant is based on several linesof evidence. First, although single mutant plants con-taining AtrabD2b orAtrabD2c mutant alleles are indis- tinguishable morphologically from their wild-type counterparts, even when grown under a variety of Figure 10 AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are both Golgi resident proteins . Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were co-transformed with GFP-AtRabD2b or GFP-AtRabD2c and the Golgi marker ST-YFP. GFP, YFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence were detected by confocal microcopy. At least 10 transformed protoplasts were observed for each construct. Upper panel, GFP-AtRabD2b; lower panel, GFP-AtRabD2c. Scale bar  10 m.Peng et al .BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:25 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-22291125Page 12 of 16growth conditions, the AtrabD2b2c double mutant has a short-silique phenotype. Second, both AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant plants produce a small percentage of deformed and collapsed pollen grains, while AtrabD2b 2clines produce a higher percentage of deformed pollen grains, many of which are severely deformed, some lack- ing nuclei. It is probable that such aberrant pollen would give rise to defects in pollen germination, andindeed, though the germination rate is similar betweenAtrabD2b orAtrabD2c single mutants and wild-type plants, about 10 of the pollen grains from AtrabD2b 2cdouble mutant plants are unable to geminate. Furthermore, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant pollen tubes do not grow apically as well as do wild-type pollen tubes and tend to have swollen tips and a shorter length; this phenotype is substantially more severe inAtrabD2b2c double mutants. In addition, some pollen tubes from AtrabD2b2c double mutants branch or burst, which is not seen in pollen tubes of wild-typeplants or either single mutant. These data also indicatethat the loss of function of the AtRabD2b2c genes can- not be compensated for by the AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a genes, suggesting that eithe r some function(s) of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c proteins are distinct from those of AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a, or that they are notexpressed in the same cell types. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2 c co-localize with the Golgi marker ST-YFP upon tra nsient expression in Ara- bidopsis leaf protoplasts, as was reported also forAtRabD2a (formerly called AtRab1b) 15. It is therefore possible that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c function in vesi- cle trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus, asdoes AtRabD2a 15,22. Complete disruption of Rabfunction in ER-to-Golgi trafficking is expected to belethal, due to loss of plasma membrane, vacuole and cellwall assembly and integrity. However, the AtrabD2b2c double mutant is indistinguishable from wild-type plants,except for shorter siliques due to the pollen and pollen tube defects. There are severa l possible explanations for this. First, other AtRabs must perform the same function in vegetative tissue. The most likely candidates areAtRabD2a and AtRabD1, which could compensate fort h el o s so ff u n c t i o ni nt h eAtrabD2b2c mutant in most cell types 22. Moreover, other Rab families, such astobacco RabBs (NtRab2s) have also been shown to beregulators of membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus 16. AtRab Bs (AtRab2s) may have the same function, such that the y also participate in ER to Golgi vesicle trafficking. The pattern of AtRabB1b RNA accumulation is most highly correlated with that ofAtRabD2b (67) and AtRabD2c (68) (Additional file 1,Table S1). These genes might compensate in part for theloss of function of AtrabD2b2c .Second, pollen tubes grow very rapidly compared with many other cell types. Pollen tubes elongate by tipgrowth, whereby the pollen cytoplasm is confined to themost proximal region of the tube, and growth isrestricted to the tube apex 35. In vitro ,l i l yp o l l e n tubes grow at about 150 nmsec 35 and Arabidopsis pollen tubes at 37 nmsec 36; in vivo , tobacco pollen can grow at 42 nmsec 37. This fast growth is contin- gent on rapid vesicle trafficking to deliver large amountsof membrane and cell wall components to the apicalregion of the tubes. This extensive trafficking require-ment may preclude the remaining Rabs from completelycompensating for loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Third, computational analysis of public microarray data, together with studies of the expression patterndirected by the AtRabD2b a nd AtRabD2c promoters, indicated that both are widely expressed in most organsand several cell types, with high expression in pollen.Root hairs also showed expression of AtRabD2b, and,like pollen tubes, root hairs elongate by tip growth.However, root hair growth in the AtrabD2b2c double mutant is indistinguishable from that of wild-type plants. This is consistent with the idea that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are required for vesicle trafficking inmultiple cell types, and that the highest demand for thisprocess may be in pollen and pollen tubes, in order tooptimally support the large s ecretory requirement of these very rapidly elongating cells. In combination, thesedata indicate that the high expression of AtRabD2b andAtRabD2c in pollen may be important to facilitate membrane trafficking needed for pollen tube growth. Conclusions In summary, we used a T-DNA insertion mutant approach to demonstrate the function of AtRabD2b andAtRabD2c. Our data indicated that both are Golgi resi-dents; they have similar but not identical expression patterns, but are both highly expressed in pollen; they are both involved in tip growth of pollen tubes; and they are at least partially functionally redundant. Futurework will focus on elucidating the molecular basis forthe pollen phenotype in the AtrabD2b2c double mutant. Methods Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Wild-type Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) ecotype Columbia (Col-0), AtrabD2c-1 ,AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2b2c (crosses of AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1 ) mutants in the same genetic background were used.Seeds were sown in Sunshine Soil mix, incubated at 4Cfor 2 to 3 days, then grown at 22C, 70 relative humid-ity, in a 16-h light8-h dark photoperiod 26.Peng et al .BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:25 http:www.biomedcentral.com1471-22291125Page 13 of 16Screening for T-DNA insertion mutants T-DNA insertion mutants of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c (Salk_045030 ( AtrabD2b-1 ), Salk_117532 ( AtrabD2b-2 ) and Salk_120116 ( AtrabD2b-3 ) for AtrabD2b; Salk_054626 ( AtrabD2c-3 ) for AtrabD2c) were obtained from ABRC 38. Homozygous lines for T-DNA inser- tions were identified by PCR genotyping. For eachT-DNA insertion mutant, two sets of PCRs were per-formed using genomic DNA as a template: one with a gene-specific primer and a T-DNA left border primer LBb1, the second with two gene-specific primers. ThePCR products were sequenced to confirm the locationsof the T-DNA insertion sites for all of the mutants. Thegene specific primers used are listed in Table 2. Crossing and screening for double mutant Single mutant alleles ( AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1 ; Figure 1A) were crossed, the F1 generation of thesecrosses was allowed to self fertilization and theAtrabD2b2c double mutant was identified from the F2 generation by PCR genotyping. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 20 DAI (daysafter imbibition) plants using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using Super- ScriptIII One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen,) as per the manufacturer sm a n u a l .T h e b-tubulin gene, which is highly conserved and constitutively expressedin all eukaryotes, was used as a standard. The primersused are listed in Table 2. The RT-PCR products weresequenced to confirm the c orrect amplification product.In vitro pollen germination and growth measurement Pollen was obtained from flowers collected from Arabi-dopsis plants (ten plant lines per genotype) 1 to 2 weeksafter bolting. Pollen from AtrabD2b2c ,AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, along with pollen from wild-type plants, was germinated on agar medium containing 18(wv) sucrose, 0.01 (wv) boric acid, 1mM MgSO 4, 1mM CaCl 2,1 m MC a ( N O 3)2, and 0.5 (wv) agar, pH 7 . 0 3 9 o v e r n i g h ta tr o o mt e m p e r a t u r ea n de x a m i n e d and photographed under a Zeiss Axioplan II compound microscope equipped with an AxioCam color digitalcamera. Measurements were performed using SIS Prosoftware (OSIS, Lakewood, CO) using the bars in the ori-ginal image. For pollen tube length measurements, 200pollen tubes were chosen randomly for each genotype,and significance was assessed using Student st-test. For fluorescence microscopy, the germinated pollen was transferred onto a slide and two drops of anilineblue solution (0.005 aniline blue solution in 0.1 Msodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were added for ten minutes. To confirm the pollen tube growth defects, 20 open flowers per genotype were cut below the pistil and insertedvertically into germination medium in a 9-cm Petri dish.Plates were sealed and incubated overnight at 22C at100 humidity under continuous illumination. The paths of pollen tubes inside the pistils were visualized by fixing whole pistils in 2 glutaraldehyde and 2 paraformalde-hyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, underlow vacuum (18 psi Hg) for 2 h at room temperature.Samples were washed three times in the same buffer andstained with Aniline Blue and DAPI. The tissue was thencleared for 24 hours at room temperature with a drop ofclearing solution (240 g of chloral hydrate and 30 g of gly- cerol in 90 ml water). Pollen was examined with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 light microscope (LM) and images were cap-tured with a Zeiss AxioCamHRc digital camera (CarlZeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) using AxioVision 4.3 soft- ware. The microscope was equipped with a DAPI filter setcomprising an excitation filter (BP 36512 nm), a beamsplitter (395 nm), and an emission filter (LP 397 nm). Theobjectives used for imaging were a Neofluar 40 oil, an Apochromat 63 oil, and a Neofluar 100 oil. Cloning Promoter::GFPGUS fusion constructs were made for each gene by cloning the amplified promoter region (intergenic region; 964 bp for AtRabD2b and 558 bp forAtRabD2c) into the binary vector pBGWFS7 (GATE-WAY; Invitrogen). The genomic fragments containing AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c with their respective promoters for comple-mentation of the mutant phenotype were amplifiedusing AtRabD2b-g-F and R or AtRabD2c-g-F and R pri-mers (Table 2).

Plant transformation and selection Arabidopsis plants were transformed using Agrobacter- ium tumefaciens by the floral dip method 40 and selected for Basta resistance conferred by the T-DNA. Transcriptomic analysis MetaOmGraph (MOG; http:www.metnetdb.org) 25was used to analyze expression patterns of AtRabD1,AtRabD2a, AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c and derive thecorrelation between them. GUS assay Transgenic T2 seedlings were germinated in soil and har-vested at various stages of development. Plants or organswere stained at room temperature overnight as described41, then destained in 70 (vv) ethanol. For each con-struct, at least 7 independently transformed lines, 7 plantsfor each stage, were harvested for GUS screening. Transient expression in protoplasts Transient gene expression in Arabidopsis mesophyllprotoplasts was carried out as described previously 42.In brief, Arabidopsis protopl asts were isolated from the leaves of 3-4 week old plants. Leaf strips were digestedin a buffer containing cellulose R-10 and macerozymeR-10. After adding 30 g of plasmid DNA, an equal volume of protoplasts was mixed with PEG buffer (40 (wv) PEG4000, 25 (vv) 0.8M mannitol, 10 1M CaCl 2) then incubated at room temperature for 25 min. After gentle washing, the protoplasts were kept in thedark at room temperature overnight and then viewed byconfocal laser scanning microscopy as described below. Confocal laser scanning microscopy Colocalization of GFP-RabD2b and GFP-RabD2c with ST-YFP was performed using a Leica TCS SP10 confo- cal microscope, which allows flexible selection of emis- sion bandwidths to minimize bleed-through.Transformed cells were excited with a 488 nm laser(power 20) and 514 nm laser (50 power), and GFPand YFP signals were collected using 495-510 nm and560-640 nm bandwidths, respectively. Non-transformedcells and cells expressing as i n g l eG F Po rY F Pf u s i o n were used as controls to confirm the absence of crosstalk between GFP, YFP and autofluorescence signals. Scanning electron microscopy Pollen that had been germinated in vitro was placed in 2 glutaraldehyde and 2 paraformaldehyde in 0.1 Msodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under low vacuum(18 psi Hg) for 5 h at room temperature. Samples werewashed three times in the same buffer, postfixed in 1osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h and washedt w ot i m e si nt h es a m eb u f f e r ,f o l l o w e db yd e i o n i z e dwater. Samples were dehydrated through a graded etha-nol series (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100; 30 min per step), followed by two changes of ultrapure 100 ethanol, all 30 min per step. Fresh pollen was also examined with-out fixing. Fixed samples were critical point-dried in aDCP-1 Denton critical-point-drying apparatus (http:www.dentonvacuum.com) using liquid carbon dioxide,and mounted on aluminum stubs with double-sidedsticky pads and silver cement. Samples were then sputter-coated with 15 nm gold (20) and palladium (80) in a Denton Vacuum LLCDesk II Cold Sputter Unit (http:www.dentonvacuum.com), and viewed with a JEOL 5800LV SEM (http:www.jeol.com) at 10 kV. Alternatively, released fresh pollengrains were directly mounted on stubs and sputter-coatedwith gold particles before SEM analysis. All digitally col-lected images including the LM and SEM images wereprocessed in Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and made into plates using Adobe Illustrator 10. Over 20 samples from each plant line were used for SEM or LM analysis. Additional material Additional file 1: Table S1. Expression pattern of AtRab genes .

        "conclusion": "s: These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members. Background Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) regulate diverse processes in eukary otic cells including signal transduction, cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organizationand intracellular membrane trafficking. GTPases areactivated by GTP binding and inactivated by subsequenthydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thus acting as mole-cular switches in these processes 1,2. The Rab GTPasefamily is the largest and most complex within the Rasprotein superfamily. Rab GTPases are important regula-tors of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling processes in eukar- yotic cells 3-6. Rab GTPase functions have been exten-sively studied in yeast and mammalian systems. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that different Rab proteins function in distinct intracellularmembrane trafficking steps and they are hypothesized towork together with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins to promote specificity of vesicle transport to target com-partments and facilitate ve sicle and target membrane fusion 7-13. They are therefore essential for the trans-port of proteins and membrane through the endomem-brane system to their destination. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 93 putative Ras superfamily proteins. Fifty-seven of these are RabGTPases, more than in yeast but similar to the numberin humans 13,14. According to their sequence similar-ity and phylogenetic clustering with yeast and mamma- lian orthologs, these Rab proteins were assigned to eight subfamilies, AtRabA to AtRabH, which can be furtherdivided into 18 subclasses 13. Relatively few of theplant Rab orthologs have been investigated functionally.Most of these studies have used constitutively active(CA) andor dominant negative (DN) mutations, gener-ated by direct mutation of the conserved domain torestrict mutant GTPase proteins to the active GTP- bound form (constitutively active) or inactive GDP- bound form (dominant negative).

For anumber of plant Rab GTPases, expression of their CAand DN mutants in transformed plants, together withprotein localization information, has shown that theseRabs perform functions similar to those of their yeast and mammalian orthologs 15-19. Several reports indicate t hat Rab proteins are impor- tant for elongation of tip-growing cells in plants. For example, AtRabA4b is reported to localize to the tips ofroot hair cells and was proposed to regulate membranetrafficking through a compartment involved in thepolarized secretion of cell wall components 18. NtRab2GTPase is important for trafficking between the endo- plasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies in tobacco pollen tubes and may be specialized to optimally support thehigh secretory demands in these tip growing cells 16.NtRabA (Rab11) in tobacco i s predominantly localized to an inverted cone-shaped region at the pollen tube tip,and both constitutively active and dominant negativemutants resulted in reduced tube growth rate, meander-ing pollen tubes, and reduced male fertility 20. There are four genes in the Arabidopsis RabD subfam- ily, AtRabD1 (At3g11730), AtRabD2a (At1g02130, AtRab1b), AtRabD2b (At5g47200, AtRab1a) and AtRabD2c (At4g17530, AtRab1c) 13. In mammals, the orthologs of AtRabD, Rab1 isoforms, physically associatewith the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment andGolgi and regulate membrane trafficking between theER and Golgi complex 21. Fluorescent protein fusions with AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b localize to the Golgi and trans -Golgi network 22,23, and transient expression in plant cells of dominant negative mutantsofrabD2a orrabD1 resulted in the inhibition of ER-to- Golgi trafficking 15,22,24, suggesting a related functionfor the plant Rab1 homologs. Pinheiro et al. 22 isolatedT-DNA insertion mutants in each of the AtRabD familygenes and reported that each of the single and double mutants lacked a detectable phenotype. By contrast, a rabD2a rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant was lethal and a rabD1 rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant had stunted growth and low fertility, indicating that these gene family mem-bers perform important and overlapping functions. We previously hypothesized that closely related genes with a high Pearson correlation in their RNAaccumulation level are functionally redundant, and showed that expression patterns of both the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes are negatively correlated with the process of starch synthesis 25, whereas the expression patterns of the remaining RabD genes are not. We therefore predicted that these two Rab proteins mayhave redundant functions that are not shared by theother two AtRabD family members. Here we show thatAtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated in theirRNA accumulation level across a variety of experimen-tal conditions. Phenotypic analysis of knockoutmutants indicates that they are at least partially func-tionally redundant, and are important in pollen devel-opment and pollen tube growth. The proteins bothlocalize to the trans -Golgi, consistent with their pro- posed role in trafficking from the ER to the Golgiapparatus.",
