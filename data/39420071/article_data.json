Benian1 UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region.Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeresand SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlatedwith more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels,increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondriashow increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot beuncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from anincreased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres tomitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production. Muscle sarcomeres contain extraor dinarily large proteins, 700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 in C. elegans2;p r o j e c t i n , obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and bronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including alack of M-lines 69.unc-89 is a complex gene, which utilizes three pro- moters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11(WormBase). Over- lapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngealmuscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying andintestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest ofthese isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains,a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and twoprotein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodieslocalize UNC-89 to the M-line 8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library withsegments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identi ed at least 7 inter- acting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans 2.Interactions were veri ed by a combination of in vitro binding assays using puri ed recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and ana- lysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatasesinteract with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containingeither of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interactwith SCPL-1 12, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a reg-ulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) 13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phos- phatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared. The Drosophila genom e contains a single unc-89 gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown ies are unable to y and their indirect ight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines andmisplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thinlaments 14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and ies. Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17,a n d striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homo- logous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, 1Department of Pathology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.2Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.3Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA.4Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.5Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research, Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. e-mail: pathgbemory.edu Communications Biology  (2024) 7:1342 11234567890():,; 1234567890():,;including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC- 89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus ratherthan near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk 16,19. Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heartfailure, and distal skeletal myopathy 20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myo brils to the sar- coplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with anankyrin protein localized to the SR 21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myobril organization but disorganized SR23.T h i sm y o bril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924. Obsl1 is an 200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is locali zed to M-lines, Z-disks, and inter- calated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growthdefect (3M-growth syndrome) 26. Substrates for UNC-89 PK2 have not yet been identi ed and an understanding of the in vivo substrates for the kinase domains ofobscurin is in its infancy. However, sequence analysis suggests thathuman obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases 27, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro28. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro28.O b s c u r i nP K 1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK129. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteinsimplicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electrontransport chain (ETC) 30. Speci cally, nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins were downregulated. Analysis of the proteomedata suggested downregulation of ETC proteins was more associatedwith loss of obscurin than with Obsl1. PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity featu res being strictly conserved across arthropods 31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231. So far, the experiments on obscurin have utilized a knockout of the entire protein, not speci cally eliminating the activity of one or more kinase domains. Taking advantage of the genetic manipulability of C. elegans ,w e used CRISPRCas9 to create a worm that expresses UNC-89 having theestablished kinase inactivating mut ation, lysine-to-alanine, in the ATP pocket of the PK2 catalytic domain. These mutants have normal sarcomerestructure, normal force generation, even better than normal muscle func- tion, and yet display fragmented mitochondria that have increased basalrespiration that cannot be uncoupled further. We gained insight into molecules and processes that lead to m itochondrial fragmentation, uncou- pling, and higher ATP. Our results s uggest signaling from sarcomere to mitochondria which may function to match energy needs to energy pro-duction, and that PK2 of UNC-89 (obscurin) is key to this communication. Results Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PK2 is an active kinase and that a mutation expected to abolish activity is not expected toresult in instability A sequence analysis of PK2 from C. elegans UNC-89 using BLAST con- rmed that it belongs to the DMT class of CAMK kinases (Ca2 Calmo- dulin-dependent kinases). The DMT class takes its name from their representative Death-associated-protein kinases (DAPKs), Myosin light- chain-kinases (MLCKs), and Triple functional domain protein-related kinases (TRIO) and contains, in additi on, various muscle kinases including human titin kinase, nematode twitchin kinase (TwcK) and mammalianobscurin and SPEG kinases 32. The BLAST search revealed that PK2 sharesthe highest sequence identity le vels with DAPKs, TwcK, and MLCK (Supplementary Fig. 1). DAPK, TwcK, and MLCK kinases are proven to be catalytically active and their phosphotransfer has been characterized3335. Referencing the UNC-89-PK2 sequence to these other kinases reveals a high con- servation of catalytically relevant motifs in PK2. Speci cally, canonical kinases are characterized by a glycine-rich GxGxxG loop motif involvedin ATP-binding, an AAK motif in -strand 3 containing an essential lysine (that optimally positions the non-transferable - and -phosphate groups of ATP), a conserved glutamate residue in helix C that forms asalt bridge with the essential lysine during the catalytically committedstate of the kinase, a DFG signature motif (where the aspartate residuechelates the magnesium ion required for catalysis), a catalytic aspartateand a conserved asparagine residue (also involved in cation coordina-tion), both in the catalytic loop motif 36,37. These groups are conserved in UNC-89-PK2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). A minor variation is present only in the glycine-rich motif, which in UNC-89-PK2 adopts thesequence FxGxxS. In fact, this motif is commonly diversi ed across obscurin and UNC-89 PK2 kinases across phyla (Supplementary Fig. 2).Degeneration of the rst and last positions of this motif is common among kinases and is known not to compromise ATP-binding orphosphotransfer. For example, the active kinases CDK11 38,T P 5 3 R K39, and mouse obscurin PK228contain ExGxxG, KxGxxA, and RxGxxS motif variants, respectively. During the course of this study, the recombinant production of UNC- 89-PK2 samples compatible with viable phosphotransfer experimentation could not be established. Thus, in order to further investigate whether a phosphor-transfer productive conformation is attainable by UNC-89-PK2,we calculated its 3D model using AlphaFold and tested in silico its capabilityof accommodating ATPMg2 (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In kinases, the mutual arrangement of N- and C-terminal fold lobes, theposition of the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop, the orientation of the cata-lytic helix C hosting the conserved glutamate residue that coordinates the magnesium counterion, the conformation of the activation loop that gov-erns access to the catalytic aspartate at the peptide binding site, the con-formation of the conserved DFG-mo tif, and the assembly state of two dynamic structural networks o f hydrophobic residues termed spines ,i s dynamically altered to achieve catalytic readiness 36. Nucleotide binding to t h ek i n a s en o r m a l l yi n d u c e st h ef o r m a t ion of the catalytically committed state. Distinctly, DMT kinases exist in a catalytically-primed state in theabsence of ATP-binding, which does no t induce a further conformational rearrangement 31,32. In agreement with this existent knowledge, the 3D model of UNC-89-PK2 displayed a regular kinase fold with features typical of thecatalytically-primed conform ational state of a kinase (Fig. 1a, b). At the residue level, the ATP-binding lysine K7816 is modeled forming a typicalsalt bridge to the conserved glutamic acid E7827 in the catalytic helix C. The canonical DFG-motif (re sidues 7921-7923) is modeled in the in- conformation and the activation loop is in an open state. Both the regulatory (R)-spine (residues L7831, L7842, H 7899 and F7922) and the catalytic (C-) spine (I7799, A7814, V7863, I7907, M7908, F7909, V7965 and L7969) areassembled. The modeled structure of UNC-89-PK2 closely resembles that ofhuman DAPK1 and was also compatible with its ATPMg2 binding mode (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that UNC-89- PK2 shares the sequence and conformat ional features of established cano- nical kinases. Mutation of the K in the AAK motif to A or several other residues has been shown to inactivate most known kinases 40. To assess whether the introduction of a KtoA mutation in PK2 could render the kinase unstable,we tested the effects of this mutation on the 3D model of PK2 using FoldXv4 41.T h i sy i e l d e dac a l c u l a t e dc o m p a rative protein unfolding energy, G, of0.15 kcalmol and indicated that no signi cant stability change arises from the introduction of the mutation. To summarize, UNC-89-PK2 is modeled by Alphafold in a catalytically-primed conformational s tate compatible with kinase activity, the active site comprises the essential functional groups necessary forhttps:doi.org10.1038s42003-024-07042-3 Article Communications Biology  (2024) 7:1342 2phosphor-transfer and the introduced mutation is not expected to cause structural instability. Taken together, bioinformatics analysis indicates that UNC-89-PK2 is a canonical, active ki nase and that the observed nematode phenotype in this work results from hindered phosphor-transfer by PK2resulting from the inactivating KtoA mutation.Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with PK2 KtoA have normally organized sarcomeres, SR, and microtubules, and move fasterthan wild-type nematodes We used CRISPRCas9 to create a worm (Fig. 1d),unc-89(sf22) ,i nw h i c h PK2 has a K7816A mutation. The strain was outcrossed 4 times to wild type to remove most of the potential off-ta rget mutations induced by CRISPR. By western blot, this KtoA mutation does not detectably affect the expression orstability of full-length UNC-89 isoforms (Fig. 1d) using an established antibody 10. Surprisingly, unlike all other unc-89 mutants, unc-89(sf22) worms have normal sarcomere structure as assessed by immunostainingusing antibodies to various sarcomeric proteins, including UNC-95 for thebase of M-lines and dense bodies (Z-disks), MHC A myosin heavy chain forA-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, a nd F-actin for I-bands (Fig. 2ac). Detec- tion and localization of the PK2 KtoA mutant UNC-89 to M-lines, thenormal localization of wild-type UNC-89 in sarcomeres 8,10, is consistent with the western blot showing no major l o s so ft h em u t a n tU N C - 8 9p r o t e i n . To examine the myo lament lattice at higher resolution we used EM. As s h o w ni nF i g . 2d, the ultrastructure of the sarcomeres in unc-89(sf22) and in unc-89(syb1360) , a second, independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutant allele (see below), appear as in wild type; there are normally organized A- and I-bands, normal numbers of thick and thin laments, and normally organized dense bodies, M-lines and membranous sacs of the SR. Because de ciency of mouse obscurin 23and worm UNC-8924result in disorganized SR, we examined SR organization using the marker UNC-68(Ryanodine receptor). However, HA-tagged UNC-68 endogenouslyexpressed from a CRISPRCas9 strain (Supplementary Fig. 4a), or myc- tagged UNC-68 overexpressed from a transgene (Supplementary Fig. 4b) show normal localization in unc-89(sf22) . Obscurin is also required for nor mal microtubule organization 42. However, we found no difference in mic rotubule organization comparing wild type vs. unc-89(sf22) , using a transgenic line expressing TBA-1 ( - tubulin) tagged with HA (S upplementary Fig. 5). unc-89 is also expressed in the single sarcomere muscle cells of the pharynx. UNC-89 is normally localized to the middle of the A-bands ofpharyngeal sarcomeres 8,10. All previously characterized unc-89 mutants, except for unc-89(tm752) , have abnormally organized l a m e n t sa so b s e r v e d by polarized light or immunostaining6,9,11, with characteristic arc-like thick laments at the periphery of the terminal bulb. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, both unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) display normal pharyngeal muscle as assessed by staining with anti-UNC-89 and the pharyngealmuscle-speci cM H CC . Nearly all previously characterized unc-89 mutants have reduced whole animal locomotion and generate reduced maximal force 9, most likely because sarcomere disorganization results in reduced muscle activity. Theone known exception is unc-89(ad539) , but this mutant only affects the organization of the pharyngeal muscl e. Two independently derived UNC- 89 KtoA mutants, unc-89(sf22) andunc-89(syb1360) , crawl faster than wild- t y p ew o r m so na na g a rs u r f a c e( F i g . 3a), and generate the same amount of maximal force 43as wild type (Fig. 3b). Nematodes expressing UNC-89 PK2 KtoA, or an unc-89 mutant lacking expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, have frag-mented mitochondria Blondelle et al.30created a mouse doubly knocked out for both obscurin and obsl1 and demonstrated that by proteome analysis, these mice have changesin metabolic pathways, including decr eased levels of nearly all mitochon- drial electron transport chain comp lexes. This report prompted us to examine the morphology and function of mitochondria in UNC-89 KtoAmutants. Using an antibody to the mi tochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A, and identifying the body wall muscle cells using antibodies to UNC-95, we found that mitochondria in wild-type muscle are organized into long wavy chains, parallel to the sarcomeric A- and I-bands (Fig. 4a), as reported by others 44. In comparison, mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) appear fragmented. This can be seen by confocal (Fig. 4a) and structured illumi- nation microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 4b).

Bot- tom, left: western blot comparing the levels of UNC-89 giant isoforms in wild type vs. unc-89(sf22) . The giant isoforms of UNC-89 are 800 kDa. The asterisk indicates a protein of nonspeci c reactivity detected by the anti-UNC-89 antibodies 46.https:doi.org10.1038s42003-024-07042-3 Article Communications Biology  (2024) 7:1342 3related giant protein twitchin with a catalytically dead protein kinase domain, unc-22(sf21) , or twitchin with a missense mutation in Ig7, unc- 22(e105)45have normally organized mitochon dria (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that effects on mito chondrial morphology are speci cf o r UNC-89 PK2 and not a function shared by protein kinases of the other giantmuscle proteins in the worm. We nd similar abnormal fragmentedmorphology of the mitochondria in unc-89(tm752) animals, which lack expression of all kinase-containi ng isoforms, but do express other isoforms 8,11(Fig. 4a). In contrast, a more normal (wild type) morphology of mitochondria is seen in two other unc-89 mutants: unc-89(e1460) as t o p codon in an alternatively spliced exon for Ig20-Ig2624,46, which expresses kinase-containing isoforms; and in unc-89(su75) a frameshift mutation in https:doi.org10.1038s42003-024-07042-3 Article Communications Biology  (2024) 7:1342 4the exon for Ig3946, that lacks expression of all giant isoforms but expresses the small kinase-containing isoforms (Fig. 4a, b). Our impressions of mitochondrial morphology are support ed by a quantitative analysis of the SIM images (Supplementary Fig. 8): b inning the mitochondria for length indicates that unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752) have no mitochondria 10m, and fewer mitochondria between 5 and 10 ma sc o m p a r e dt o either wild type or unc-89(e1460) . Therefore, either inactivation of PK2 kinase or lack of expression of PK2-co ntaining isoforms results in frag- mented mitochondria. Because CRISPRCas9 can result in off-target effects, we generated 3 more CRISPR alleles ( sf24,syb1195 ,a n d syb1360 ) resulting in the same KtoA amino acid change. sf22andsf24are independent alleles generated from the same sgRNA, and syb1195 and syb1360 are independent alleles generated using a different sgRNA. The mutant alleles were outcrossed 3X to wild type.The new mutants displayed the same mitochondrial fragmentation as unc- 89(sf22) worms (Fig. 4c, d), suggesting that the KtoA mutation in UNC-89 PK2 adversely affects mitochondrial morphology. In PK2 KtoA mutants, mitochondrial fragmentation results from greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria InC. elegans , mitochondrial fusion and ssion are primarily controlled by 3 proteins44(Fig. 5a): fusion is mediated by FZO-1 (ortholog of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)) on the outer membranes of opposing mitochondria, and by the inner membrane protein EAT-3 (OPA1); ssion is mediated by DRP-1 (Drp1), which is mostly cytosolic but can be recruited tomitochondria where it forms a large sp iral that constricts mitochondrial membranes. We nd that the drp-1(tm1108) mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously 47(Fig. 5b), and that an unc- 89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e., drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22) .T h ee p i s t a s i so f drp-1 over sf22indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity.T h i sf u r t h e rs u g g e s t st h a tD R P - 1p r o t e i nc o u l db eat a r g e to ft h ep r o t e i n kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, dire ctly or indirectly through a kinase cascade. In mammals, Drp-1 shuttles between the cytosol and mitochondria, and upon association with mitochondria, ssion is promoted 48.W et e s t e d the hypothesis that part of the mechanism by which unc-89 KtoA mutants have more mitochondrial fragmenta tion is that more DRP-1 is associated with their mitochondria. We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validatedthe antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wildtype (80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from a drp-1 deletion mutant (Fig. 6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of two unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants ( unc-89(sf22) orunc-89(syb1360) )( F i g . 6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of D RP-1 associated with puri ed mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 6c). There- fore, the greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria at leastpartially explains how the mitochondria in PK2 KtoA mutants are morefragmented.Increased levels of ATP in PK2 KtoA mutants Because mitochondrial fragmentation i s usually associated with decreased respiration and ATP production49,50, we compared levels of ATP in wild type vs. each of the 4 PK2 KtoA mutant allele s. Using a luciferase assay on whole worms, we were surprised to nd that each mutant shows at least a 40 increase of ATP compared with wild type (Fig. 7). However, unc-89 is expressed only in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and intestinal muscle,and a few myoepithelial cells of the oviduct. Thus, we utilized a method toassess ATP levels primarily in the body wall muscle, the major site of UNC-89 expression. The ATP:ADP ratio, is a sensitive indicator of cellular energystatus 51.T h e uorescent biosensor PercevalHR can measure this ratio in living cells52,53. The ATP:ADP ratio is proportional to uorescence at 529 nm at two excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm)54.T h e myo-3 gene, which encodes myosin heavy chain A (MHC A), is primarily expressed inbody wall muscle but is also expressed in a few single sarcomere muscle cellsand in a few myoepithelial cells of the gonadal sheath. We created transgenicworms that express PercevalHR primarily in body wall muscle using themyo-3 promoter. We rst validated the technique by showing: (i) the ATP:ADP ratio is decreased in animals treated with antimycin A (inhibitscomplex III) (Supplementary Fig. 9a , c), and (ii) the ATPADP ratio is decreased in drp-1(tm1108 ) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with a report that drp-1 mutants have decreased ATP levels 55. The ATPADP ratio is increased in unc-89(sf22) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d ), consistent with the increased levels of ATP in the whole animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these results do not reach the level of statistical signi cance, they do show trends consistent with our ten tative conclusions. Complex I respiration is increased, complex II respiration is decreased, and each cannot be uncoupled in unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants We next tested the hypothesis that the increase in ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants is due to enhanced mitochondr ial function. We utilized a method to isolate mitochondria from any cell type in C. elegans56to isolate mito- chondria primarily from body wall muscle cells. We used a strain in which the fusion protein tomm-20-mKate2-HA was expressed from the myo-3 promoter, total mitochondria were puri ed, and then mostly muscle- specic mitochondria were pulled out using anti-HA-magnetic beads. Mitochondrial respiration in musc le mitochondria was assayed using an oxygen electrode. We investigated both complex I and complex II-basedrespiration as electrons can take two paths through the electron transport chain: either I to III to IV or II to III to IV. When assessed for complex Iinduced respiration (addition of subs trates malate and glutamate), muscle mitochondria from unc-89(sf22) andunc-89(syb1360) showed signi cantly higher rates of basal respiration, and the respiration could not be uncoupledby adding FCCP (Fig. 8a). When assessed for complex II-induced respira- tion (addition of the substrate succinate), the UNC-89 KtoA mutants showed lower rates of basal respiration, which could also not be uncou- pled (Fig. 8b). To gain insight into why complex I respiration is increased and complex II respiration is decreased, we assessed the protein levels of onecomponent of each electron chain complex by western blots. Unfortunately,Fig. 2  Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with the KtoA mutation in PK2 have normal muscle structure. a The drawing on the right shows a cross-section through an adult worm indicating that the body wall muscle is organized into four quadrants.Each quadrant is composed of interlocking pairs of mononuclear fusiform-shaped cells(23 or 24 per quadrant). The enlargement emphasizes that the myo lament lattice is restricted to one side of the cell. The drawing depicts several planes of section; one plane emphasizes that this is striated muscle with typical A-bands containing thick laments organized around M-lines, and overlapping thin laments attached to dense bodies (Z-disk analogs).

As shown in Fig.8c, d, the levels of complexes I and V are normal, complexes II and IV are decreased, and cytochrome C (whic h shunts electrons from III to IV) is increased. These results only partially explain why complex II-basedrespiration is decreased.Increased glycolysis in PK2 KtoA mutants Although the increase in complex I-based respiration might partiallyexplain the increased level of ATP in the PK2 KtoA mutants, we exploredthe additional possibility that glycolys is was increased. There is precedence for a compensatory increase in glycol ysis when mitochondria do not per- form well 57. We measured the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in gly- colysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. The activity of this enzyme is signi cantly increased in all 4 PK2 KtoA mutants (Fig. 9). Thus, increased glycolysis at least partially explains why there is an increase in total ATP levels in PK2KtoA mutants, however, the mechanism of this increase remains elusive. Uncoupling might result from increased levels of the uncoupling protein UCP-4 in PK2 KtoA mutants That both ETC I and ETC II-based respiration cannot be further increased by uncoupling reagents (Fig. 8a, b), suggests that the mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gra dient across the intermembrane space is generated by electron transfer, but the gradient can be dissipated byuncoupling proteins (UCPs) 58. UCPs are a family of transporters that permit proton movement back into the mitochondrial matrix, and some UCPs areinvolved in generating heat. Thus, uncoupling should result in less ATPproduction, and the observed increase in ATP is likely due to increasedglycolysis (Fig. 9). Mammals express 5 UCP proteins, but C. elegans express only a single UCP, called UCP-4. Nematode UCP-4 is primarily expressedin the body wall and pharyngeal muscles 59.W ew i s h e dt oe x p l o r et h ep o s - sibility that the level of UCP-4 is altered in the PK2 KtoA mutants. Wecreated a CRISPRCas9 strain in w hich UCP-4 has an HA tag at its C- terminus, and this strain was crossed into unc-89(sf22) andunc-89(syb1360) . A ss h o w ni nF i g . 10, the level of UCP-4 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in PK2 KtoA mutants. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains theuncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants, but why UCP-4 levels are increasedawaits further study. Increasing the level of PK2 increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria Since the presumed inactivation of PK 2 leads to mitochondrial fragmen- tation we wondered what would happen i f the activity of PK2 was increased. We tested this by overexpressing a portion of UNC-89 containing wild-type PK2. We reported that a segment consisting of the C-terminal third of the interkinase region followed by Ig53, Fn2, and PK2 (13 IK-Ig-Fn-Pk2),when transgenically expressed from a heat shock promoter localizes to theM-line, the normal location of UNC-89 46.T h i ss t r a i na n dw i l dt y p e ,a sd a y1 adult animals, were heat-shocked at 30 for 2 h, and then immunostainedusing anti-ATP5A to image the mitochondria. As shown in SupplementaryFig. 10a, although mitochondria fro m the wild type showed the expected lineartubular organization, mitocho ndria from the strain expressing the PK2 fragment showed more clump i n g .A ss h o w ni nS u p p l e m e n t a r y Fig. 10b, heat shock of this extra PK2 did not change the total level of DRP-1,but as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10c, it decreased the level of DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. Discussion Werst performed bioinformatics analysis indicating that UNC-89 PK2 is a canonical active protein kinase an d that a particular missense mutation (KtoA) is expected to abolish activity but not the stability of the protein. Weused CRISPRCas9 to create worms that express UNC-89 isoforms withcatalytically inactive PK2 protein kinase domains and we observed an unexpected and speci c phenotype. In contrast to all previously described unc-89 loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoAmutants have fragmented mitochond ria. Although mitochondrial frag- mentation is usually associated with d ecreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased a nd complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase incomplex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreasedand the level of complex II was decreased. Thus, it seems that the effect of Fig. 3  UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutants move faster than wild type but exert the same amount of force as wild type. a Crawling assays on wild type (WT), several unc-89 loss of function alleles ( e1460, su75 ,tm752 ), and two independently derived PK2 KtoA mutants ( sf22and syb1360 ).

The observed increase in glycolysis might be a compensatory response to altered mitochondrial respiration. We gained molecular insight into how the mitochondria are frag- mented. The conserved GTPase Drp1 is required for mitochondrial frag-mentation, and in mammals, this occurs by recruitment of Drp1 to the outermembrane by adaptors, then oligomer ization, recruitment of dynamin 2, and membrane scission 60.W ef o u n dt h a tt h e r ei sm o r eD R P - 1a s s o c i a t e d with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants , thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 bytransgenic overexpression increases m itochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria . The association of Drp1 is known toFig. 4  Body wall muscle cells of UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. aConfocal images of body wall muscle stained with antibodies to ATP5A to reveal the morphology ofmitochondria. Note that wild type has mitochondria organized as long wavy lines running parallel to the A- and I-bands, described as tubular . In contrast, unc-89(sf22) which carries the PK2 KtoA mutation, and unc-89(tm752) which lacks expression of all kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria thatappear as dots or can be described as fragmented. Bycomparison, unc-89(e1460) which maintains expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, and unc-89(su75) which lacks expression of all giant isoforms but still expresses small kinase-containingisoforms have mitochondria that appear more tub- ular or more like wild type. b3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria of the indicatedstrains.

That both complex I and complex II respiration could not be further uncoupled led us to postulate that the mitochondria are alreadyuncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space can bedissipated by uncoupling proteins which transport protons back into themitochondrial matrix. Although mammals express 5 UCP proteins, C. elegans expresses only a single UCP, UCP-4. This allowed us to easily explore whether this mechanism of uncoupling is abnormal in PK2 KtoAmutants. We found that the level of UCP-4 protein is elevated in PK2KtoA mutants as compared to wild type. The higher level of UCP-4 likelyexplains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how thisoccurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade. Moreover, more uncouplingmeans that mitochondria produce less ATP, and thus elevated ATP levelsin PK2 KtoA mutants are most likely due to increased glycolysis. Further insight into the mechanisms that generate the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants awaits determining the in vivo substrates for PK2.Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful inproducing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phospho-transfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoAmutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sar-comere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such commu-nication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomerecontraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and mostof this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very closepacking of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacentmyobrilSRT-tubule cylinders are lled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle,mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria 61. This organi- zation likely ensures rapid and ef cient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus62. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up intomyobrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myo brils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even inC. elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mito-chondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolicactivity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscleperformance. Although our studies provide a possible molecular mechanism by which sarcomeres communicate with mitochondria, our study is not the rst to provide evidence of communication between these organelles. In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al. 63 demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria andmyobrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, brillar, exempli ed by indirect ight muscle in which individual myobrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myo brils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria aredifferent in these muscle types. In indirect ight muscle, the mitochon- dria are elongated and lie between the myo brils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 requiredforssion, the morphology of indirect ight muscle resembled leg muscle with myo brils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mito- chondria located inside. Increased mitochondrial fragment ation has been linked to a reduction in mitochondrial function 49,64. However, some studies suggest that mito- chondrial fragmentation is not alway s associated with decreased function and may be bene cial. For example, in rat gastrocnemius muscle, resistance exercise resulted in an increase in activated Drp1 (Drp1 phosphorylated atserine 616), suggesting activation of mitochondrial ssion 65.F e n ge ta l .66 reported that in rats during early exercise, there was increased expression of thession mediator Fis1. A more de nitive study was reported on heart muscle67. After exercising mice for 1 h, the a uthors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidativestress was not increased, mitochon drial membrane potential was main- tained, pro-mitophagy proteins decrea sed, and mitochondrial respiration was increased. Their conclusion is that mitochondrial fra gmentation asso- ciated with increased mitochondrial function is part of the normal cardiacresponse to increased energetic demand encountered during normal levelsof exercise. Our ndings in C. elegans striated muscle that a kinase-dead version of UNC-89 results in mitochond rial fragmentation but increased respiration and ATP levels are consistent with this report on exercised mouse heart.

To detect UNC-89 proteins, weseparated the protein lysate on a 3 stacking and 5 separating LaemmliSDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h, andreacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 af nity-puri ed rabbit polyclonal antibodies at 1:400 dilution 10, followed by reaction with anti-rabbit Ig- horseradish peroxidase and ECL. Western blots to detect DRP-1 wereused in three types of experiments. First, to check the speci city of anti- DRP-1 antibodies, equal quantities of total protein lysates from wild typeand drp-1(tm1108) were separated on a 10 Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted against af nity-puri ed anti- DRP-1 at 1:200 dilution which had been pre-absorbed against an acetonepowder of E. coli OP50 to reduce or eliminate reaction to bacterialproteins. Second, we used a similar approach to compare the levels ofDRP-1 in total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc- 89(syb1360) . Third, we compared the level of DRP-1 from total worm mitochondria from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) .P r e - paration of total worm mitochondria by differential centrifugation wasconducted as described below in the section on purifying muscle mito-chondria.

Measurement of mitochondrial length in m from the 3D recon- structions of SIM images was perfor med using Imaris software on a com- bination of 2 images from each wild type and mutant strain. The longest axis of each anti-ATP5A-staining object ( mitochondrion) was determined using the Imaris parameter called BoundingBoxOOLength . After eliminating objects 1 m ,t h en u m b e ro fo b j e c t sw a sp l a c e da n dc o u n t e di n3b i n s : 15 m, 51 0 m, and x 10m. The Y axis of the graph in Supplementary Fig. 8 represents the number of objects in each bin dividedby the total number objects. Electron microscopy Electron microscopy of body wall muscle was performed as described inMatsunaga et al. 45. From each strain, approximately 200 days 2 adults were xed and processed, and approximately 10 randomly selected ultrathin sections were examined. Approxima tely 30 low-powered images were captured that revealed all of the sarcomeres of single body wall muscle cells,and from these 10 20 images at higher magni cation were captured that revealed 1 2 sarcomeres each. All these images were examined by two individuals both on a computer scr een and by printouts, looking for any differences between the wild type and the two mutant alleles, sf22and syb1360 . Representative images are shown in Fig. 2d. Crawling assays and NemaFlex force measurement For crawling assays, day two adults were harvested from one 6 cm NGM OP50 seeded plate with M9 buffer, and a nal wash in M9 containing 0.2 gL gelatin. Five microliters of worm suspension were added to the center of a 6 cm unseeded NGM plate and then the excess liquid was removed using a twisted KimWipe. After a ve-minute adaptation time, worm crawling movement was recorded using a dissecting stereoscopic microscope tted with a CMOS camera (Thorlabs). For all strains a total of fteen, 10-s. videoswere recorded from various sections of the plate with each video tracking an average of 8 individual animals. Video data was analyzed by Image JWrmTracker software plug-in to obt ain body bends per second (BBPS) for individual animals. Worms that moved out of frame and outliers wereremoved during data analysis and an average of 20 animals were analyzedfor each strain. The resulting BBPS values for each mutant strain were compared to the wild type and furthe r tested for statistically signi cant differences using Welch sT-test. The maximum exertable muscle force by C. elegans strains was mea- sured using the NemaFlex method 43. The technique is based on the deection of soft micropillars as the animals crawl through an array of micropillars. The pillars are arranged in a square lattice with a pillar dia- meter of 44 ma n dh e i g h to f8 7 m. The gap between the pillars is 71 m. Day 1 adult animals were loaded individually in each chamber76,a n da Fig. 9  PK2 KtoA mutants display increased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. Statistical signi cance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch s correction.

Imaging was performed in bright eld using a Nikon Ti-E microscope and an Andor Zyla sCMOS 5.5 camera. Imageswere acquired at 5 frames per second with a 4 objective at a pixel resolution of 1.63 m per pixel. Movies were processed and analyzed for force values using in-house-built image processing software (MATLAB, R2016a). Ani-mal muscle strength measurements were calculated by identifying themaximal force exerted in each fra me for an individual animal. We de ne the maximum exertable force f 95corresponding to the 95th percentile of these maximal forces. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Generation of antibodies to DRP-1 Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were ge nerated to the C-terminal 143 residues of DRP-1b, amino acids 570-712. The coding sequence of this segment was ampli ed by PCR from a cDNA pool (RB2 library) and cloned into vectors pGEX-KK1 and pMAL-KK, to express glutathione S-transferase (GST) andM B Pf u s i o np r o t e i n si nE .c o l i 77. In brief, to express each fusion protein, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Millipore Cor-poration, cat. no. 71397-4), and grown i n Luria-Bertani broth containing 10 gml ampicillin at 37 to OD 6000 . 6 0.8, followed by induction of expression with 0.5 mM isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 for 5 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl uoride (PMSF) and cOmplete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Inc., cat. no.11836170001), and broken in a French pressure cell at 1000 pounds inch 2, the addition of Triton X-100 to 1, followed by spinning out debris by centrifugation at 12,000  gfor 20 min. The lysates were added to either a slurry of glutathione-agarose bea ds (Sigma, cat. no. G-4510) or amylose resin (New England BioLabs, cat. no. E8021L) and incubated with mixingfor 30 min at 4. The beads were washed 5X with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0containing 1 Triton X-100 and 100 mM PMSF, and then 4 with 50 mMTris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM PMSF. The beads were placed intominicolumns and eluted with either 10 mM free glutathione or 10 mMmaltose in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The GST fusions were shipped to Noble Life Sciences (Sykesville, Maryland) for the production of rabbit antibodies.Antibodies were af nity-puri ed using Af -gel (Bio-Rad)-conjugated MBP fusions, as described 78.B r i e y, the MBP fusion proteins were dialyzed against 100 mM 3-morpholinopropan e-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) pH 7.0, and then 3 10 mg were covalently coupled to 1 ml of a 50:50 mixture of Af - Gel 10 and Af -Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad Labor atories, cat. nos. 1536099 and 153-6051). These columns were then used to af nity purify 2 ml of anti- serum and the antibodies eluted with low and high pH and concentratedwith a centrifugal lter (Centriprep 10, Millipore, cat. no. 4304). Measurement of ATP levels in whole worms 100 day 1 adults were collected and washed free from bacteria, pelleted in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, frozen in liqu id nitrogen, and then placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. After placing on ice for 5 min and vortexing for 5 s, debris was pelleted by centrifugation at maximum speed in amicrofuge for 10 min at 4 C. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubesand diluted 5 10 fold with deionized water and kept on ice. Using this material, the total protein content was determined by the BCA protein assaykit (Pierce, cat. no. 23225), and the total ATP determined using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assa y kit from Promega Corporation. Results were expressed as nmoles of ATP per milligram of protein. Use of PercevalHR to measure ATPADP ratio The plasmid pRsetB-PercevalHR wa s purchased from Addgene (Cam- bridge, MA), and The XbaIXhoI fragment of pRsetB-PercevalHR was inserted into the vector pPD95.86 via its XbaISalI sites to allow expression of PercevalHR from the muscle-speci c promoter for the myo-3 gene. The resulting plasmid, myo-3p::PercevalHR at 10 ngml, was co-injected intoworms together with the transformation marker plasmid lin-44p::GFP at90 ngml, into wild-type worms, and transgenic animals were selected onthe basis of GFP expression in the wor m tail. The extrachromosomal array was then integrated randomly into the genome by ultraviolet irradiation 79 with modi cations (Peter Barrett, personal communication), to create strain GB296, sfIs21 myo-3p::PercevalHR; lin-44p::GFP. sfIs21 was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and into drp-1(tm1108) , to create strains GB355 and GB356, respectively. PercevalHR is based on GlnK1 which undergoes a majorconformational change depending on whether ATP or ADP is bound.Coupling of GlnK1 to mVenus creates a uorescent read-out of this con- formation. An ATP to ADP ratio is p roportional to emission at 533 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 488 nm. Day 1 transgenic adults wereimmobilized for imaging without d rugs using a combination of a PDMS micro uidic device with channels just la rge enough to accommodate adult worms and Pluronic F127 80.T h em i c r o uidic devices were kindly manu- factured and provided by Gongchen Sun from the Hang Lu laboratory at theGeorgia Institute of Technology. Aqueo us solutions of Pluronic F127 are uid at 4, and solid at room temperature. Body wall muscle was excited with a laser at 405 and at 488 nm using an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocalmicroscope. Ratiometric images of body wall muscle were created bydividing the emissions, Em 488Em 405. Using Fiji software on these images,the total number of pixels with intensi ty greater than 100 were counted, and the means and standard deviations wer e calculated from multiple body wall muscle cells from 5 animals of each strain. Purication of muscle mitochondria and respirometry Body wall muscle-speci c mitochondria were puri ed from strains expressing tomm20-mKate2-HA fro m the promoter of the muscle-speci c gene myo-3 , using a modi ed version of the procedure developed by Ahier et al.56.B r i e y, for each strain, we harvested a mixed-stage population of nematodes from 2, 15 cm, high peptone plates seeded with E. coli strainNA22. Worms were washed free from bacteria by at least 3 washes of M9buffer, followed by 2 washes with de ionized water. The worm pellets were resuspended in 3.5 mls of ice-cold Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer (MIB;50 mM KCl, 110 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM TrispH 7.4 without protease inhibitors) and transferred to a 7 ml Douncehomogenizer. While on ice, we brought the pestle up and down 25 times.The homogenate was transferred to 3, 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and spun in amicrofuge at 4 for 5 min at 200  g. The resulting supernatant was trans- ferred to 3 fresh tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at 800  g. This super- natant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000  gto pellet the mitochondria. The pellets from all 3 E ppendorf tubes were resuspended in a nal volume of 600 l of ice-cold PEB (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 1 bovine serum albumin, without protease inhibit ors). To this suspension was added 30 lo f a suspension of anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, cat. no. 88836), and thetube placed on a rotating wheel at 4 for one hour. The beads were thenpulled out of the solution using a tube stand containing neodymiummagnets (Millipore Corporation), a nd then the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of PEB, and then resuspended in 50 100l of MIB and kept on ice. Mitochondrial respiration was m easured using a Clark electrode (Oxytherm System, Hansatech) as described 81.B r i e y, isolated muscle mitochondria were suspended in res piration buffer containing 120 mM KCl, 3 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM KH2PO4, and 0.3 (wv) fat-freeBSA. Complex I substrates (10 m M glutamate, and 2 mM malate) or complex II substrates (7 mM succinate) were added in addition to 1.2 mMADP to stimulate basal respiration. U ncoupled respiration was measured with the addition of 80 nM FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-p-tri-uoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), an d non-mitochondrial oxygen con- sumption was assessed with the addition of potassium cyanide (500 M). To assess mitochondrial respiration, t he non-mitochondrial oxygen con- sumption rate was subtracted from t he total oxygen consumption rate. Glycolysis assay We used Abcam s6-Phosphofructokinase Activity Assay Kit (colori- metric) (ab155898) essentially according to the manufacturer s instruc- tions. Approximately 50 milligrams of packed worms were homogenized in200l of PFK Assay Buffer, using a Pellet Pestle Motor (DWK Life Scienceshttps:doi.org10.1038s42003-024-07042-3 Article Communications Biology  (2024) 7:1342 13Kimble Kontes). After determining the protein concentrations using a Bradford assay, approximately 1 g of total protein extract was used per assay. PFK activity was recorded as mUmg protein. Statistics and reproducibility GraphPad Prism9 was used to plot and analyze numerical data. Figurelegends explain the n values, whether st andard deviations or standard errors of the mean were plotted, which statistical tests were used, and the de nition ofvalues. Statistical signi cance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch s correction unless otherwise speci ed. Each experiment was con- ducted several times independently and only if the same results or ten-dencies were obtained, were gures and conclusions made. Many experiments involved imaging and evaluation of the images was conductedby at least two individuals but in most cases, no quantitation was involved, sostatistical analysis was not used.
