E-mail: maxnflmnh.ufl.edu Introduction The amphibian decline controversy has focused on many factors that affect amphibian populations to varying degrees 1,including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, pollution,increased ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, direct exploitation,introduced species and disease, including infectious disease 2,3.Although evidence of disease in amphibian populations is not new,early literature on amphibian health in natural populations is quitescattered, deals primarily with anurans andor local problems, orwas initiated because of concerns related to supply and demandand decline of commercial harvest 46. In the late 1960s andearly 1970s, various biological supply houses noted problems inthe commercial supply of amphibians causing Maugh 7 to comment on the apparent short supply and diseased state ofamphibians collected in nature. The review of mycoses of amphibians by Reichenback-Klinke and Elkan 8 primarily focuses on Basidiobolus ranarum and Saprolegnia parasitica and indicates the dearth of knowledge relating to the distribution and importance of microfungi associated withamphibians. With few exceptions, this void continued for the next two decades 912. The impetus for research on amphibian microbes became a major focal point of the 1 stWorld Herpetology Congress in Canterbury, England in 1989, where herpetologistsshared their observations on declining frog populations anddeveloped initial strategies to investigate the potential problems. PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 December 2011  Volume 6  Issue 12  e28906The discovery that the chytridiomycete Batrachochytrium dendroba- tidis, a zoosporic fungus related to infectious oomycete water molds, Saprolegnia spp., was capable of causing lethal dermatitis in amphibians led to a proliferation of studies 13. After reviewing studies of microbes implicated in amphibian population declines, including chytridiomycosis, Ranavirus disease, saprolegniosis and Ribieroia spp., Daszak et al. 14 concluded that available data provide the clearest link for the fungal disease amphibian chytridiomycosis. Herpetological Review dedicated an entiresection to amphibian chytridiomycosis geographical distribution 1517. The advances in research on the secretions, structure, and functions of amphibian integument and their products reveal a remarkable complexity of bioactive secretions and diversity of amines, peptides, alkaloids, bufodienolides, and other compounds18,19. The presence of antimicrobial agents in amphibian skin hypothesized by Csordas and Michl 20 and Croce et al. 21 has led to an increased interest in the relationship of the bacteria andfungi present in the skin of amphibians and the antimicrobial peptides and metabolites that they produce 2230. Some of these peptides and alkaloids can inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi31,32 and common cutaneous bacteria from the terrestrial salamander Plethodon cinerus can inhibit pathogenic fungi 33. Evidence also suggests that symbiotic bacteria may contribute toinnate immune defense of some amphibians 30. While evidence suggests that these antimicrobial compounds and symbiotic bacteria can provide some level of protection for amphibiansagainst microbial invaders 3033, the connection between disease and amphibian decline has been confirmed for some amphibian populations 34. However, long-term amphibianstudies, especially those including population and environmental data, are so rare that we have very few data to support many claims related to decline or changes in, or the health of, wildamphibian populations 35. One long-term study subject, the Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganensis bishopi , and its habitat within a 4.6 km section of the North Fork of White River(NFWR), has been the subject of numerous investigations since the intensive 110 day surveys conducted during 19691971 36,37. In 1969, the 4.6 km research section within the North Fork of White River (NFWR), Ozark County, Missouri, was a crystalline, substantially spring-fed stream located in the least densely humanpopulated area of the second least densely populated county in the state (9 peoplesq mi; 38). Only one rarely used sportsmans cabin graced the banks of the research section in 1969. Thesprings and occasionally the river were used as drinking water by some locals and visitors. From 1969 to 1980, 169 days of skin- diving surveys, coupled with environmental sampling, wereconducted in this section, including some in every year and within every calendar month, but not every month of every year 39. Population and ecological studies of the aquatic Ozark HellbenderC. a. bishopi and its habitat were conducted in this section during 19691971 36,37. Other ecological studies included year-round water quality, benthic habitat, macro-invertebrate structure, cottidfish diet studies, and numerous shorter-term studies 36,40. These early studies in the NFWR found an immense and healthy population of C. a. bishopi , as many as 428 individualskm, and almost no abnormalitiesinjuries. Only 2.9 of 479 individuals observed in 1969 were abnormalinjured and they exhibited rapid regeneration capabilities 36,39,41. Additional surveys between1972 to 1980 continued to show immense and healthy populations of Ozark Hellbenders 27,42. All surveys during this time period ranged from between 912 individual Ozark hellbenders collectedper hour per person (Nickerson et al, unpublished data). Reassessment of the ecological characteristics of the NFWRconducted in 20042007 revealed extensive habitat alteration and degradation, including increased land development, siltation, sedimentation, and water quality degradation 43. Community changes included algal and nuisance aquatic vegetation blooms, otter establishment, and fish and macroinvertebrate community alterations 43. Canoe use within the NFWR significantly increased 43. Intensive surveys of the NFWR hellbender population conducted in 2005 yielded only 55 individuals, of which 26 (i.e., 47) had visible abnormalitiesinjuries, including loss of limbs, limbs with exposed bones, and degeneration of other tissues which did not regenerate or had remarkably retardedregeneration (J. Briggler, unpublished data). The high prevalence of abnormalitiesinjuries and the lack of the historically charac- teristic (rapid) regeneration of injuredaffected tissue in hellben- ders in the NFWR was the impetus for our examination of the microbial community associated with the observed abnormalities injuries. Results Our results reflect our strategy to optimize chances for successful culture of potentially pathogenic microorganisms by using three different media for each sample; blood agar (all purpose growth media), mannitol salts (differential and selective media), Sabourauds (differential and selective media often used to isolate fungi) (Figure 1). An evaluation of the microbial flora sampled from C. a. bishopi indicated the presence of common environmental flora from both abnormalinjured and uninjured limbs. A wide variety of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria were isolated. While no consistent pattern of bacterial colonization was observed between uninjured and abnormalinjured body parts (Tables 1 and 2), several interesting microbial associations were observed. The genus Aeromonas was identified in 9 separate occasions, although the amphibian pathogenic species Aeromonas hydrophila , was identified only once from an abnormalinjured animal (NFWR 139 - lower lip). Likewise, certain organisms that can cause human infection were also identified, including the opportunistic pseudomonal pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NFWR 135 - right back limb), P. stutzeri (NFWR 134 - right back; NFWR- 135 right back), P. alcaligenes (NFWR  right front), and the pseudomonal-like pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (NFWR 136  left front limb). In addition, the poultry pathogen Riemerella anatipestifer 44 was also isolated only from abnormal injured animals. On rare occasion, one bacterial species would represent the vast majority of the colonies from a given abnormal injured sample as exemplified by the known human pathogen Granulicatella adiacens (formerly Streptococcus adiacens ; 45), which represented 91 of the 163 bacterial isolates found on the blood agar plate associated with the NFWR 139 lower lip sample. When using Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, only fungi were isolated, except for one plate (from the injured animal NFWR 135 - left front limb) where 4 colonies of Kocuria kristinae (previously Micrococcus ) were found, which is a common inhabitant on human skin that has been increasingly associated with infectious disease in humans 46. Fungal isolates were consistent with common environmental flora from genera that included Penicillium ,Streptomycetes ,Cladospo- rium,Fusarium ,Acremonium ,Curvularia , and the Class Hyphomycetes (Tables 3, 4, and 5). Discussion The C. a. bishopi population decline in the NFWR is well documented and of significant concern 42,47,48. Many reasons for the decline in population and health of the Ozark HellbenderMicrobes Cultured from Injured Hellbender Tissues PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 2 December 2011  Volume 6  Issue 12  e28906have been suggested, including flooding 39,49 amphibian harvesting 42, the use of the anesthetic MS-222 (Tricane) 50,51, the reintroduction and introduction of species includingotters and trout 47,52, habitat alteration and degradation 53, disease including those having a genetic, chemical, or infectious etiology 36,41,48,50,51,5361, and the interaction of thesefactors 47. Many of these hypothesized causal agents of decline have been investigated to various degrees, yet disease research has largely been limited to B. dendrobatidis 5961, and prior to our study, the microbial community associated with the abnormalities typifying the affected hellbenders had not been assessed. As a variety of pathogenic microbes have been linked to amphibiandeclines, it is critical that the microbial community be examinedfor all potential disease agents and that research not be initially limited to a single potential infectious agent until causation has been properly evaluated and established. While our microbiological evaluations in this study indicated common environmental organisms in both abnormalinjured anduninjured Ozark Hellbenders, several opportunistic pathogenic organisms were identified that were associated only with the abnormal tissueinjuries of C. a. bishopi , such as Aeromonas hydrophila , a known pathogen of amphibians 62,63, Granulicatella adiacens 64, Stenotrophomonas malophilia 65, and a variety ofopportunistic pathogen Pseudomonad species - P. aeruginosa 66, P. stutzeri 67 and P. alcaligenes 68. These microbial pathogens are known to form biofilms in the environment andor in vivo inthe infected host. Several of the filamentous fungi isolated in thisstudy, including Penicillium ,Fusarium ,and Cladosporidium are genera containing opportunistic pathogens that are known to beassociated with environmental biofilms 6972. Multispeciesbiofilms may interact synergistically yielding an increasedresistance to antibacterial agents 73. While a possible causeand effect role for biofilms in disease progression observed in theOzark Hellbenders is outside the scope of this study, thisobservation warrants investigation in future studies. The lack ofisolation of the same organism from multiple wounds suggests thatnone of the organisms identified were the sole etiological agentresponsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi . If the immune system of the injured C. a. bishopi were repressed, it is possible that a combination of the isolated opportunistic pathogens may havecontributed to the observed tissue damage. The Gram positiveopportunistic pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae , was isolated from one animal. While the presence of S. pneumoniae may be the result of contamination during collection or processing, the genusStreptococcus has been found by the EPA downstream of our NFWR research site. Figure 1. Representative microbial flora cultured from C. a. bishopi on three different media.

River otters ( Lutra orLontra canadensis ) used in reintroduction programs are known to carry a suite of pathogenic microbes,including Gram positive Streptococcus spp. and Gram negative Pseudomonas spp. 74. Otters reintroduced into Missouri were sourced from Louisiana and could carry many different microbeswhich are not found in the streams of the Ozark Highlands 75.We speculate that reintroduced otters may introduce pathogenicmicrobes into the environment through fecal transmission or directcontact with hellbenders, crayfish (the primary prey of both ottersand hellbenders), or other species. In addition, river otters are capable of killing or injuring C. a. bishopi . Non-lethal injuries such as bites or scratches yielding open sores may provide a pathway forpathogens. Non-native rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) and brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) are stocked in the NFWR annually. These trout come from multiple hatcheries with multiple watersources and are transferred between hatcheries, which have knownreoccurring water quality issues, including harboring pathogenicmicroorganisms 76. While we know of no predation of C. a.bishopi by salmonids in the wild, hatchery-raised trout released into the NFWR and other water bodies may serve as a source forpathogens. Increased recreational use of NFWR may also be a source of hellbender injury and pathogenic microbes. Canoeing and otherwater activities may disturb or dislodge habitat rocks, inadvertentlyinjuring hellbenders located underneath 43. Humans may alsobe a source of pathogens such as S. pneumoniae , one of the opportunistic bacteria found in this study. The rapid regeneration that historically typified injured hellbenders was not apparent in recent studies of the NFWRpopulation. Based on data collected in 1969, hellbender injuries (i.e., tail holes) induced by tagging healed completely with no sign of infection and no visible scars within two months (Nickersonunpublished data). The remarkable regenerative capacity ofsalamanders has been known since first reported by Spallanzaniin 1769 77. Regenerative studies have included phylogenetic,seasonal, and environmental analysis of limb regeneration 7779. Environmental factors that have been considered to affectregeneration include temperature, diet, photoperiod, parasitism,infection, and quality of terrestrial and aquatic microhabitats 79.Table 1.

Previous studies investigating the impact ofhuman activities on NFWR water quality revealed relatively high concentrations of total phosphorus (652 mgL21) and total nitrogen (0.353.06 mg L 21) in the 4.6 km research site originally investigated by Nickerson and Mays 80,81. The impact of thistype of increased nutrient level on the hellbenders was investigatedby Solis et al., which focused on a historically populated area,Table 2.

Not unexpectedly, the site studied by Solis et al. indicatedthat nutrient concentrations (including total phosphorous andnitrogen) exceeded the EPA recommended criteria in two thirds ofthe samples 80. However, a direct correlation between theseelevated levels and abnormalitiesdisease of the hellbenders wasnot supported, as all individual concentrations of nutrients andorganic chemicals were at much lower levels than any laboratoryand field experiments shown to have deleterious effects onamphibians 80. Likewise, serum samples from C. a. bishopi collected at the Solis et al. site were analyzed for possibleendocrine disrupting chemicals, however, none were detected atlevels above the EPA and Missouri Clean Water Commissioncriteria for aquatic organisms 82. Thus, the direct impact ofincreased chemical levels on the hellbenders remains inconclusive. The impact of eutrophication associated with human activity was further investigated in a periphyton survey of the NFWR in2006 to determine if changes in the periphyton communities couldbe a factor in the Ozark Hellbender decline 81. SomePeriphyton, such as cyanobacteria (i.e., blue-green algae) maycause cutaneous damage, neural and hepatic effects, tumor induction, diarrhea, vomiting, respiratory dysfunction, convulsionsand occasionally death 83. The periphyton community withinthe NFWR 4.6 km Nickerson and Mays research section consistedof diatoms, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria 81. The green algaeCladophora spp. achieved relative abundances of .90 of the total periphyton community 81. Blooms of the benthic, filamentousCladophora spp. are a visible indicator of eutrophication and are linked to phosphorus concentration with 20 mgmL21being the threshold for Cladophora dominance 84,85. High nitrate concen- trations are an issue with karst topography such as that in theNFWR drainage 81 and increases in human usage and poorsewage facilities. Large Cladophora spp. blooms have been a component of the NFWR since at least 1968, but have increasedover the decades and large floating algal masses seen during recentsummers were not a component of the NFWR 4.6 km sectionduring the early surveys 36. Increased algal levels are known toincrease both biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance, andCladophora spp mats maintain higher E. coli densities than the surrounding aquatic habitat 86,87.

A 2007 study of total coliform (TC) bacteria and Escherichia coli content was conducted at multiple sites and habitats in the NFWRbetween Mark Twain National Forest Campground Access andNorfork Reservoir, as well as springs which flow into the NFWR89. Total coliform levels exceeded the values deemed safe for fullbody contact by Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) in 70 of 94 individual water samples and 25 of the 94samples also surpassed concentrations of E. coli deemed safe for full body contact 89. Our results do not preclude that an infectious agent caused or exacerbated the tissue damage observed in Ozark Hellbenders, asother microorganisms, which would not grow on the media used in this experiment, may have been present (i.e., the microbial diversity observed in this study is likely a subset of the total microbial diversity). Alternatively, if the immune system of the abnormalinjured C. a. bishopi was suppressed, many of theTable 5. Fungi identified on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar.

As such, the increase inincidence of abnormalitiesinjuries and retardation of tissueregeneration may have multiple contributing factors includingchanges in the Ozark Hellbenders susceptibility to infection andexposure to microorganisms. The Ozark hellbender is a federallylisted endangered species that has yet to have successfullyreproduced in captivity. The unavailability of healthy Ozarkhellbenders, small sample size, and conservation status precludedour ability to evaluate all of Kochs Postulates. However, this studyprovides the most complete analysis of potential microbial stressorson Ozark hellbenders to date and places these findings in thecontext of habitat alterations. Follow up studies are planned toidentify causative mechanism(s) and environmental factors that arecontributing to health and population declines in this endangeredspecies. Materials and Methods The Ozark Hellbender, C. a. bishopi , is now listed as endangered and populations have been extirpated and face extinction in muchof the former range. The NFWR currently supports only a verysmall population of C. a. bishopi , of which about 50 within the original NFWR research section of Nickerson and Mays 36,37have substantial abnormalitiesinjuries (J. Briggler unpublisheddata). On 17 August 2007, we methodically searched a portion ofthe NFWR by snorkeling and lifting rocks. We located andcaptured six adult hellbenders, all with abnormalitiesinjuries(Table 6). Each individual hellbender was placed into a cleanbucket filled with river water and then measured, weighed, andindividually photographed. All C. a. bishopi were visually inspected for the presence of leeches, injuries, or abnormalities. The feetlimbs showing signs of infection (e.g., lesions, sores or exposedbone) were swabbed with sterile, buffered swabs. In addition, thelower lip of one individual with a raw sore was swabbed (Figure 2).Swabs were then streaked onto three different microbiologicalculture media: sheeps blood agar (SBA), a general all purposegrowth medium that supports the culture of a large number ofmicroorganisms and also indicates hemolytic activity; MannitolSalt Agar (MSA), primarily selective for halo-tolerant bacteria such as staphylococci; and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDX), primarily selective for fungi (Figure 1). Given the very small population of C. a. bishopi currently existing in the NFWR and given that no animals without abnormalityinjury were captured throughout the duration of this study, two feet showing no signs of infection fromtwo C. a. bishopi were swabbed in the same manner and served as uninfected controls. The swabs were streaked onto the different agar plates, and sample plate lids were immediately added and secured with tape. Secured plates were immediately placed into styrofoam coolers with ice packs and transported by vehicle to St. Louis, MO, and flown to the Microbiology Laboratory at the NASA Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX) for microbial identification. Bacterial and fungal isolates were enumerated and then sub-cultured on the medium from the parent culture at room temperature. Bacterial isolates were identified using biochemical analysis with the Vitek 2 system (bioMe rieux, Marcy lEtoile, France). Bacterial isolates that could not be identified by the Vitek 2 system were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing using a MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Identification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were compared to thoseon the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website for microorganisms. Speciation was reported for isolates having greater than 98 sequence similarity. Fungal isolates were identified by microscopic morphological characteristics 90. Table 6.

        "introduction": "The amphibian decline controversy has focused on many factors that affect amphibian populations to varying degrees 1,including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, pollution,increased ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, direct exploitation,introduced species and disease, including infectious disease 2,3.Although evidence of disease in amphibian populations is not new,early literature on amphibian health in natural populations is quitescattered, deals primarily with anurans andor local problems, orwas initiated because of concerns related to supply and demandand decline of commercial harvest 46. In the late 1960s andearly 1970s, various biological supply houses noted problems inthe commercial supply of amphibians causing Maugh 7 to comment on the apparent short supply and diseased state ofamphibians collected in nature. The review of mycoses of amphibians by Reichenback-Klinke and Elkan 8 primarily focuses on Basidiobolus ranarum and Saprolegnia parasitica and indicates the dearth of knowledge relating to the distribution and importance of microfungi associated withamphibians. With few exceptions, this void continued for the next two decades 912. The impetus for research on amphibian microbes became a major focal point of the 1 stWorld Herpetology Congress in Canterbury, England in 1989, where herpetologistsshared their observations on declining frog populations anddeveloped initial strategies to investigate the potential problems. PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 December 2011  Volume 6  Issue 12  e28906The discovery that the chytridiomycete Batrachochytrium dendroba- tidis, a zoosporic fungus related to infectious oomycete water molds, Saprolegnia spp., was capable of causing lethal dermatitis in amphibians led to a proliferation of studies 13. After reviewing studies of microbes implicated in amphibian population declines, including chytridiomycosis, Ranavirus disease, saprolegniosis and Ribieroia spp., Daszak et al. 14 concluded that available data provide the clearest link for the fungal disease amphibian chytridiomycosis. Herpetological Review dedicated an entiresection to amphibian chytridiomycosis geographical distribution 1517. The advances in research on the secretions, structure, and functions of amphibian integument and their products reveal a remarkable complexity of bioactive secretions and diversity of amines, peptides, alkaloids, bufodienolides, and other compounds18,19. The presence of antimicrobial agents in amphibian skin hypothesized by Csordas and Michl 20 and Croce et al. 21 has led to an increased interest in the relationship of the bacteria andfungi present in the skin of amphibians and the antimicrobial peptides and metabolites that they produce 2230. Some of these peptides and alkaloids can inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi31,32 and common cutaneous bacteria from the terrestrial salamander Plethodon cinerus can inhibit pathogenic fungi 33. Evidence also suggests that symbiotic bacteria may contribute toinnate immune defense of some amphibians 30. While evidence suggests that these antimicrobial compounds and symbiotic bacteria can provide some level of protection for amphibiansagainst microbial invaders 3033, the connection between disease and amphibian decline has been confirmed for some amphibian populations 34. However, long-term amphibianstudies, especially those including population and environmental data, are so rare that we have very few data to support many claims related to decline or changes in, or the health of, wildamphibian populations 35. One long-term study subject, the Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganensis bishopi , and its habitat within a 4.6 km section of the North Fork of White River(NFWR), has been the subject of numerous investigations since the intensive 110 day surveys conducted during 19691971 36,37. In 1969, the 4.6 km research section within the North Fork of White River (NFWR), Ozark County, Missouri, was a crystalline, substantially spring-fed stream located in the least densely humanpopulated area of the second least densely populated county in the state (9 peoplesq mi; 38). Only one rarely used sportsmans cabin graced the banks of the research section in 1969. Thesprings and occasionally the river were used as drinking water by some locals and visitors. From 1969 to 1980, 169 days of skin- diving surveys, coupled with environmental sampling, wereconducted in this section, including some in every year and within every calendar month, but not every month of every year 39. Population and ecological studies of the aquatic Ozark HellbenderC. a. bishopi and its habitat were conducted in this section during 19691971 36,37. Other ecological studies included year-round water quality, benthic habitat, macro-invertebrate structure, cottidfish diet studies, and numerous shorter-term studies 36,40. These early studies in the NFWR found an immense and healthy population of C. a. bishopi , as many as 428 individualskm, and almost no abnormalitiesinjuries. Only 2.9 of 479 individuals observed in 1969 were abnormalinjured and they exhibited rapid regeneration capabilities 36,39,41. Additional surveys between1972 to 1980 continued to show immense and healthy populations of Ozark Hellbenders 27,42. All surveys during this time period ranged from between 912 individual Ozark hellbenders collectedper hour per person (Nickerson et al, unpublished data). Reassessment of the ecological characteristics of the NFWRconducted in 20042007 revealed extensive habitat alteration and degradation, including increased land development, siltation, sedimentation, and water quality degradation 43. Community changes included algal and nuisance aquatic vegetation blooms, otter establishment, and fish and macroinvertebrate community alterations 43. Canoe use within the NFWR significantly increased 43. Intensive surveys of the NFWR hellbender population conducted in 2005 yielded only 55 individuals, of which 26 (i.e., 47) had visible abnormalitiesinjuries, including loss of limbs, limbs with exposed bones, and degeneration of other tissues which did not regenerate or had remarkably retardedregeneration (J. Briggler, unpublished data). The high prevalence of abnormalitiesinjuries and the lack of the historically charac- teristic (rapid) regeneration of injuredaffected tissue in hellben- ders in the NFWR was the impetus for our examination of the microbial community associated with the observed abnormalities injuries.",
