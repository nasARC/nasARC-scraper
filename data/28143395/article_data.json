Keywords: Transcriptomics, Root skewing, Root waving, Morphometrics, Microarray, Arabidopsis thaliana Background Plant roots have been long studied and yet investigations of root behavior, physiology, and biochemistry continue to be actively explored on every level 1 6. The work presented here seeks further insights into root growth strategies by focusing on two distinct growth patterns of root growth, skewing and waving. Skewing is when the steady-state growth direction of a root deviates from the direction of the gravity vector and waving is when the root undulates back and forth over time along its direc- tion of growth 7 14. Skewing and waving have been described as gravity-enhanced touch responses, since these root patterns are notably present when a plant isgrown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. Current models require that gravity pulls the root tip down onto the tilted surface, which increases the mechanical impedance to growth, and results in root skewing and root waving 15. However, recent spaceflight experiments with Ara- bidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) on the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that certain ecotypes have roots that deviate from vertical growth (at a magni- tude similar to skewing on the ground) and wave in the absence of gravity 16 18. These ecotypes that exhibit spaceflight skewing are also the ecotypes that exhibit ter- restrial skewing when grown at an angle 16 18. The degree of skewing in spaceflight was consistent with pre- vious terrestrial observations, but the waving pattern was different from what was typically observed on the ground 17. The causes of skewing and subsequently, the genes involved are currently unknown. The goal of this study is to discover which genes are associated with root skewing through transcription microarrays.

BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 DOI 10.1186s12870-017-0975-9Other root tropisms exist as a result of environmental interaction, which likely impact the degree of root skew- ing and root waving. Touch responses, or thigmotrop- ism, involves many genes that interact with auxin and can subsequently alter growth patterns 11, 19 28. Plants also determine their growth in relation to the gravity vector, resulting in a gravitropic set-point angle (GSA), which is most commonly associated with lateral organ growth relative to the primary organ 29. GSA is driven by auxin and TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RE- SPONSE 1AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1AFB)- dependent signaling, in a process similar to gravitropism 3032. Light can alter GSA for different plant systems 33, and light in general plays a role in root patterning and growth direction 34 42. Additional tropisms in- clude halotropism 39, 43, 44, chemotropism 45, hydrotropism 46, all of which can alter root growth response (reviewed in 3). Many hypotheses exist for the underlying molecular mechanisms and key genes responsible for root skewing and root waving. As a result, a wide variety of genes have been implicated as involved in these growth pat- terns. Hormone related pathways and processes are among the candidates, such as ethylene involvement in root waving 10 and auxin and tryptophan biosynthesis in both skewing and waving 47, 48. The cytoskeleton is also involved in skewing and waving 7, 18, 49, 50, in- cluding WAVE-DAMPENED 2 (WVD2 ; At5g28646) and WVD2-LIKE 1 (WDL1 ; At3g04630) genes, which alter cell expansion through microtubule bundle organization 51. Many genes involved in molecular patterning, sig- naling, phosphorylation, and cell wall structure are also involved in root skewing and waving. Guanosine triphos- phate (GTP)-binding proteins 11, cell expansion gene ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 3 (RHD3 ; At3g13870) with putative GTP-binding motif 13, CLAVATA -related genes 52, protein phosphatasePP2A ENHANCED ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1 (RCN1 ; At1g25490; 53), serinethreonine protein kinases WAG1 and WAG2 (At1g53700 and At3g14370, respectively; 54), and KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1 (KNAT1 ; At4g08150; 55) are all associated with mor- phological change in root skewing or root waving. The SKU family of genes were identified through phenotypic changes in root behavior, with SKU5 (At4g12420) and related genes being involved with cell wall modification and root growth 56 and SKU6 (At2g03680) and family being involved with cortical microtubule and directional cell expansion 50. While no single pathway has been identified in the literature as responsible for root skew- ing or for root waving, several different pathways have evidence for being involved. Skewing and waving are functionally separable using genetics 7, 12, 13, 51, 57. The physiological separationof skewing from waving within a ecotype can be accom- plished by using the environment, particularly the tilt angle of the growth plate, and can also occur in space- flight 16 18. The degree to which growth plates are tilted is referred to as the Angle of the growth plate (Agp). Typically, plates are tilted backward such that plants are above the media surface, at A gp45. For many Arabidopsis ecotypes, growth at A gp45 results in roots that both skew and wave. When growth plates are tilted forward, such that plants are below the media surface, at Agp135, Arabidopsis roots skew with reduced waving, similar to the pattern observed in spaceflight. Growth plates held vertically are A gp90 and are considered as the controls for growth angle, as roots on vertical plates generally do not skew or wave. This study aims to discover additional genes associated with root skewing through transcription microarray ana- lyses of Arabidopsis roots exhibiting different patterns of waving and skewing. Gene expression profiles were derived from Arabidopsis that displayed different root growth behaviors in various growth environments in order to identify gene activities associated with skewing and waving. Identified genes were validated using qRT- PCR and evaluated using previous studies for likelihood of involvement with the skewing process. Results Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave differently from one another in different growth environments Arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) differ in their skewing and waving behaviors, where WS demonstrates strong skewing and waving while Col-0 waves like WS but does not greatly skew, which was a growth pattern observed in spaceflight and on the ground (selected references: 14, 17, 49). These two ecotypes were grown at three growth angles (A gp 45, 135, or vertical control of A gp90) to produce dif- ferent root phenotypes (Figs. 1 and 2). Plants were grown for 3 days vertically, then moved to each respect- ive A gpfor 5 more days, resulting in steady-state behav- ior in each of the A gp. The first analysis compared transcriptional differences within a ecotype caused by the environmental condition of A gp, specifically differences between WS roots grown at A gp90 and WS roots grown at A gp45 or 135, and the differences between Col-0 roots grown at A gp90 and Col-0 roots grown at A gp45 or 135. Only the A gp influenced the differences in gene expression and root morphology. Roots were quantified following parameters identified in previous work 12, 58 using protocols out- lined in the Materials and Methods section. The arrows in Fig. 1 represent comparisons analyzed. Figure 1 also shows a diagram of the root morphology for each geno- type under each A gp.Schultz et al. BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 2 of 16The second analysis compared transcriptional differ- ences between ecotypes at each A gp(e.g. differences be- tween Col-0 and WS roots grown at A gp45). In this case, the ecotype influenced gene expression and morphology at the given A gp. The horizontal arrows in Fig. 1 show these comparisons. This matrix of comparisons allows two overlapping ap- proaches to using differential expression to identify genes associated with skewing. WS roots skew signifi- cantly more than Col-0 roots at A gp135 and signifi- cantly more than WS roots at A gp90 (see Fig. 1). At Agp45 WS roots skew more than Col-0 roots, but both WS and Col-0 roots also wave at 45. Quantification of root morphometrics is found in Fig. 2, using horizontal growth index (HGI; trigonometric relationship between the overall angle of growth and length of the root),straightness (STR; straight-line length of the root from start point to end point divided by the actual length of the root), and wave density (WD; waves per millimeter along root length). Comparisons involving A gp45 allow the removal of waving as a confounding factor in the gene expression analyses. Col-0 roots showed 24 significantly altered transcripts related to A gp, most of which may be involved in waving. These comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the left column of Fig. 1, with the numbers indicating the number of significantly altered transcripts from each comparison (significance cutoffs of log 2(fc)  1; p 0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Table 1. When gene expression profiles of roots grown at A gp 45 were compared to A gp90, 22 genes were shown to be differentially regulated, three of which were upregulated and 19 of which were downregulated (Fig. 3a). Col-0 plants grown at A gp45 had roots that waved but did not skew as compared to the roots of plants grown at A gp90. Thus these 22 differentially expressed genes were associ- ated with a root waving and but not root skewing. Comparison of gene expression profiles of roots grown at A gp135 with profiles of roots grown at A gp90 (Fig. 3a), revealed only 6 genes that were differentially regulated be- tween the two growth conditions. All 6 of these genes were downregulated. Morphologically, Col-0 roots grown at A gp 135 were not significantly different from those grown at Agp90 (Fig. 2). Four genes out of these six were also present among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the A gp45 comparison to A gp90, with just 2 be- ing unique (At1g09310; a protein of unknown function with DUF538 and At3g19430; a protein related to late- embryogenesis abundant proteins, Table 1). Thus the 18 genes unique to the A gp45 comparison to their 90 controls may represent genes associated with root waving, but not skewing. Many different processes were associated with these 18 genes identified, such as cell wall structure ( XTH7 ,XTH9 ) and sugar transport (SWEET11 ,OCT1 ; Table 1). Only four genes had altered transcript levels at both A gp 45 and 135, meaning that they responded to both the backward and forward tilted growth environments (Fig. 3a). All four of these genes were downregulated at approxi- mately the same levels in both conditions. These genes were At4g12490 (a pEARLI1-like LTP), THIOREDOXIN H8(TRX8 ; At1g69880), DEFECTIVE IN INDUCED RE- SISTANCE 1 (DIR1 ; At5g48485; putative LTP), and CELL WALL INVERTASE 5 (ATCWINV5 ; At3g13784).

False discovery rate (FDR) correc- tions are found in Additional file 1: Table S2. At A gp45, WS produces roots that both skew and wave compared to the roots grown vertically (A gp90). Gene expression profiles revealed that WS that were grown at A gp45 had 66 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to A gp90. Nine of the 66 genes were upregulated, while 57 were downregulated (Fig. 3b and Additional file 1: Table S2). These genes may represent those involved in both skewing and waving processes. Processes associated with these genes include lipid trans- fer (AZELAIC ACID INDUCED 1 AZI1 ; At4g12470, CELL WALL-PLASMA MEMBRANE LINKER PROTEIN CWLP ; At3g22120), pectin methylesterase inhibition (At5g62330, At2g01610), and peroxidase activity ( PER- OXIDASE 49 PER49 ; At4g36430, PEROXIDASE 53 PER53 ; At5g06720; Additional file 1: Table S2). When grown at A gp135 WS produces roots that skew without waving (Fig. 2). Gene e xpression profiles revealed that WS roots grown at Agp 135 had 40 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to WS roots grown at A gp 90. These 40 genes are likely skewing-related (Fig. 3b). Only two genes ( HISTONE H1-3 HIS1-3 ; At2g18050 and DARK INDUCIBLE 2 DIN2 ; At3g60140) also had differ- ential transcription in Col-0, and the expression level of DIN2 was in opposite directions (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). Some of the processes included are me- thionine metabolism related ( METHIONINE GAMMA- LYASE MGL ; At1g64660), histone-related ( HIS1-3 ), andjacalin-related ( JACALIN-RELATED LECTIN 40 JAL40 ; At5g28520). Other genes from these 40 will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. The genes with altered transcription in both A gp45 and at A gp135 (14 out of the 40 genes previously men- tioned) were altered in the same way in both A gp45 and 135 compared to A gp90, except for one gene. This one gene was ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE GLUTAM- INE-HYDROLYZING 1 (ASN1 ; At3g47340, also called DIN6 ,), which was downregulated in A gp45 and upreg- ulated in A gp135, and is involved in darkness responses and sucrose starvation responses. The remaining 13 genes were involved in various processes, including cell wall reorganization ( XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLU- COSYLASEHYDROLASE 9 XTH9 ; At4g03210) and sugar transport ( SWEET11 and SWEET12 ; At3g48740 and At5g23660, respectively). Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed genes that could be involved in skewing in WS The gene expression profiles between Col-0 and WS when skewing and waving were also compared. These comparisons are represented in Fig. 1 by the horizontal arrows pointing toward WS, with the number of signifi- cantly altered levels of gene transcripts indicated above each arrow. Genes altered between Col-0 and WS at the same level in all three growth angles were removed from the comparison, as they represent inherent differences between the cultivars that were independent of the test- ing environments. The plant images and morphometrics are found in Fig. 2, with resulting heat map with sixTable 1 Comparing different growth angles to vertical within Col-0Schultz et al.

The first differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between Col-0 and WS only when grown A gp 90. Genes 1 61 had altered transcript levels in Category I (Fig. 3c); 19 of the identified genes were upregulated and 42 of which were downregulated (Additional file 2: Table S3). This pattern indicated inherent genetic dif- ferences between these two lines in their control condi- tion and these differences were mitigated or no longer present in other tested growth environments.The second differential gene expression pattern had al- tered transcripts between Col-0 and WS when cultivars grown A gp90, but also had altered transcripts in a same way when grown at A gp45. Genes 62 85 had altered transcript levels in Category II (Fig. 3c); 15 of the identi- fied genes were upregulated and 9 downregulated when comparing the gene expression in Col-0 to WS roots (Additional file 2: Table S3). This expression pattern was not considered to be involved with skewing, since A gp 45 results in a combination of skewing and waving in WS and waving in Col-0.

Transcripts between the ecotypes were removed if they were altered at the same level at all A gp. For example, if the transcript for Gene A was downregulated 2 fold in all conditions, it was removed. This comparison between Col-0 and WS had 128 altered gene transcripts at A gp90, 88 altered between Col-0 and WS at A gp45, and 133 altered between Col-0 and WS at A gp135.

BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 6 of 16different in A gp135, which generates skewing without waving in WS and a non-skewing, non-waving pheno- type in Col-0 (Fig. 2). The third expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col-0 and WS when grown A gp90 and at A gp135. Genes 86 128 had altered transcript levels in Category III (Fig. 3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 23 genes downregulated when compar- ing Col-0 to WS (Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). At A gp135 WS skewed and Col-0 did not, yet these genes showed same differential expression between Col- 0 and WS roots when grown at A gp90 and do not ex- hibit any skewing or waving differences (Figs. 2 and 3c). These genes were likely not involved with skewing. The fourth expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col-0 and WS only when both were grown at A gp45. Genes 129 166 had altered transcript levels in Category IV (Fig. 3c); 30 of the identified genes were upregulated and 8 were downregulated (Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). The genes identified represent a combination of skewing and waving phenom- ena, and as such, were considered as potential root skew- ing candidates. The fifth expression pattern had altered transcript levels at both A gp45 and 135 when comparing Col-0 roots to WS roots. Genes 167 192 had altered transcript levels in Category V (Fig. 3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 6 were downregulated (Fig. 3c). Skewing occurred in WS but not in Col-0 in both condi- tions (Fig. 2), although at A gp45, skewing occurred with waving. For WS roots, skewing was a distinguished mor- phological phenotype from Col-0. The genes identified had altered transcript levels in both A gp45 and 135, and are therefore likely involved with skewing. The sixth and final expression pattern had altered transcript levels at A gp135 only, when comparing Col-0 to WS. Genes 193 256 had altered transcript levels in Category VI (Fig. 3c); 14 of the identified genes were up- regulated and 50 genes were downregulated, meaning that WS had higher levels of these 50 genes when com- pared to Col-0. These identified genes were likely involved in skewing since skewing occurs in WS at A gp135 with a bFig. 4 Comparison of candidate skew genes from physiological and genotypic comparisons. aVenn diagram of gene numbers from Fig. 3, illustrating overlap of 16 genes. The left circle represents total number of genes changed in WS (Fig. 3b) and the right circle represents total number of genes changed between Col-0 and WS in groups IV, V, and VI (Fig. 3c). bGenes with altered transcription identified in Fig. 3b (left column ) were combined with genes with altered transcription identified in groups IV, V, and VI of Fig. 3c ( right column ), resulting in 16 genes. The majority of overlapping gene transcripts occurs with A gp 135 a growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving totaling 11 highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC), shown here in bolded text with dark connecting linesSchultz et al. BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 7 of 16minimal waving but it does not in Col-0, thus is the only phenotypic difference between the roots of the two eco- types (Fig. 2). The genes from the fifth and the sixth ex- pression patterns, totaling 90 genes, were selected as a root skewing candidate genes. Overlap of skew gene candidates from all comparisons further narrows the set of skew gene candidates When combining the lists of genes identified in Categor- ies IV, V, and VI (128 genes) with genes identified within WS comparisons (66 genes altered at A gp45 and 40 genes altered at A gp135), 16 genes are shared (Fig. 4). This overlap is illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig. 4a. The majority of shared genes between the two data sets involved A gp135 the growth condition that elicited skewing with minimal waving resulting in 11 genes, which were named the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC, Table 2; also indicated by Yin Additional file 1: Table S2). Several of the HPSGC have been verified with qRT-PCR, showing similar trends to the transcriptomic microarray data see Additional file 3. The HPSGC are involved in a variety of cellular pro- cesses. Additionally, only 3 of these 11 genes were shared with the set of genes identified in Col-0 grown at A gp45, which induced root waving (Fig. 3a, Table 1). Two of these genes ( DIN2 andASN1 ) were expressed in opposite direc- tions, while the remaining gene ( SWEET11 ) was upregu- lated in all sets. The 11 genes comprising the HPSGC, indicated by bolded text in Fig. 4b, are MYO-INOSITOL OXYGENASE 4 (MIOX4 ; At4g26260; involved in inositol oxygenase activity, syncytium formation, and iron ion binding), PURPLE ACID PHOSPHATASE 24 (PAP24 ; At4g24890; involved in protein serinethreonine phosphatase activity), SWEET11 (asucrose efflux transporter), DIN2 (a beta-glucosidase mRNA, involved in glycoside hydrolase, and is induced after darkness), ASN1 (involved in darkness and su- crose starvation responses), SENESCENCE 1 (SEN1 ; At4g35770; senescence-associated, induced by phos- phate starvation), HIGH AFFINITY K TRANS- PORTER 1 (HKT1 ; At4g10310; sodium transporter in xylem parenchyma), SALT INDUCED SERINE RICH (SIS; At5g02020; involved in salt tolerance), At2g25150 (HXXXD transferase family protein involved in transfer- ring acyl groups other than amino-acyl groups), At5g66780 (unknown gene), and At3g28310 (unknown gene containing DUF677). Discussion Transcriptome comparisons within ecotypes reveal a primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skewing The primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skew- ing was identified by comparing the transcription of WS genes when grown at A gp45 or 135 compared to A gp 90. Morphologically, WS roots skew when grown at A gp 135 with reduced waving (Figs. 1 and 2). The genes with altered transcription identified in this comparison of A gp 135 to A gp90 represent the pool of genes likely in- volved in root skewing and not waving, since they were altered in a condition that induces root skewing inde- pendent of the classical root waving patterns. WS roots also skew when grown at A gp45; however, the occur- rence of waving at A gp45 complicates the relationship between skewing and transcriptome at A gp45. It is important to note that only roots were used for the microarrays, and that lateral roots appeared to be similar across all treatments. As seen in Table 2, the 11 genes associated with skewing cluster into a few biological Table 2 HPSGC and their various functional groups and signaling pathways that could contribute to WS root skewing Gene Symbol Log2(FC) Catalytic activityHormone Cell Wall Sugar Biotic stressMobile mRNADark Salt Root cellWater SUBA3 p 0.05; q 0.05 At4g26260 MIOX4 1.570 X X X X cytosol At4g24890 PAP24 1.414 X X extracellular At3g47340 ASN1 2.080 X X X cytosol At2g25150 1.839 X cytosol At5g02020 SIS 1.200 X nucleus At5g66780 1.556 plastid At3g28310 1.430 nucleus p 0.05 only At3g60140 DIN2 2.214 X X X X vacuole, extracellular At4g35770 STR15SEN1 2.100 X X plastid (chloro., thylakoid) At3g48740 SWEET11 1.804 X X plasma membrane At4g10310 HKT1 1.021 X X plasma membrane HPSGC are reported, with Xindicating to which process or category each member belongs. SUBA3 reports localization of each HPSGCSchultz et al. BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 8 of 16categories, suggesting that several pathways interact to produce skewed growth and directionality. Col-0 roots, on the other hand, did not skew as did WS roots, and as such, differed only in waving when A gp 45 or 135 were compared to A gp90. The number of genes with altered transcription at A gp45 or 135 com- pared to A gp90 was also reduced, and not considered in the list of candidate skew genes due to the lack of skewing morphology. Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed a different set of 128 genes that may be involved in skewing Comparing gene expression patterns between WS and Col-0 shows how the ecotypes cope with the same envir- onmental challenges presented to them, in this case whether the angle of the growth plate produces skewed roots. In order to determine which gene expression pat- terns are related to skewing, the relative expression pat- terns can be correlated to the morphology generated in each of the growth angles. Categories I-III in Fig. 3c are not related to skewing. The first category (Category I, Genes 1 61; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were dif- ferent between WS and Col-0 at A gp90 and also un- changed at A gp45 or 135 (Additional file 2: Table S3). The second category (Category II, Genes 62 85; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contained genes that were differentially expressed between WS and Col-0 at Agp45. However, the transcript expression of these genes was also different when the roots did not skew at Agp90, which suggests that these genes are responding to growth angle but are not responsible for causing the morphologic change. The same logic can be applied to the genes of Category III, where transcript expression was different between WS and Col-0 when grown at A gp 90 and when grown at A gp135 (Category III, Genes 86128; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). The genes of Category IV present a pattern of expres- sion that indicated a potential role in skewing (Category IV; Genes 129 166; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3), since the genes present in this category are differentially expressed between WS (which skews at A gp45) and Col-0 (which does not skew). Some of the genes identified in this category include HIS1-3 ,SKU5 SIMILAR 15 (SKS15 ; At4g37160; involved in oxidoreductase activity and copper ion binding), and XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCO- SYLASEHYDROLASE 26 (XTH26 ; At4g28850; involved in hydrolase activity and cell wall remodeling). SKS15 is re- lated to a known SKU gene ( SKU5 ), which is also known to have substantial impact on root growth and morphology 56. Protein products of XTH26 reduce cell wall elongation in roots with altered root hair morphology 59, which may also impact the overall directionality or skewing of the root.The second category of genes whose differential expres- sion between WS and Col-0 indicated a role in skewing (Category V; Genes 167 192; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between the ecotypes at both A gp45 and 135. The tran- scription of these genes was altered in the same way at both growth angles, and since skewing occurred at both growth angles (Fig. 2), it can be assumed that these genes very likely play some role in the skewing morphology (Additional file 2: Table S3). A couple of the genes identi- fied include MODIFIER OF SNC1 2 (MOS2 ; At1g33520; where SNC1 isSUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE and NPR1-1 isNONEXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS- RELATED 1 ; At4g16890 and At1g64280, respectively) and BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BEL10 ; At1g19700, where BEL1 is a homeodomain transcription factor controlling ovule patterning; At5g41410). MOS2 is a D N A - b i n d i n gg e n et h a tp l a y sar o l ei nt h ei m m u n er e - sponse pathway and in microRNA (miRNA) matur- ation 60. miRNAs are heavily involved in gene regulation 61. Since Col-0 roots have higher tran- script levels of MOS2 at both A gp45 and 135 than WS, it is possible that miRNAs are involved early in the signaling pathway leading toward root growth par- allel with gravity. The lower levels of MOS2 in WS roots could be limiting the rate of signal transduction, changing the entire pathway, and ultimately changing root directionality and introducing root skewing. BEL10 was upregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots grown at A gp45 or 135 (Additional file 2: Table S3). BEL10 is a transcription factor that interacts with PLP, a blue light receptor also involved in re- sponse to salt or dehydration stresses 62. Higher or lower intracellular levels of phosphate could alter the ability of this gene to interact downstream in phos- phate signaling pathways 36. Additionally, inorganic phosphate depravation can influence seemingly redun- dant signal peptides to subsequently alter root growth 63, which may, in turn, alter overall root directional- ity and impact skewing. T h et h i r dc a t e g o r yo fg e n e st h a ti n d i c a t e dar o l ei ns k e w - ing (Category VI; Genes 193 256; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between Col-0 and WS when roots were grown at A gp135. Since WS roots skewed at this growth angle and did not wave differently from roots grown at A gp90, the genes identified in this category were considered likely to be associated with skewing. Some of the genes in this category include RESPONSIVE TO ABA 18 (RAB18 ; At5g66400) and PINOID BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1 ; At5g54490; Additional file 2: Table S3). RAB18 was down- regulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at A gp135. This dehydrin-related protein is reduced after exogenous 1- Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) application,Schultz et al. BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 9 of 16meaning it responds directl y to ethylene in addition to abscisic acid (ABA) 64. PBP1 was downregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at A gp135. Since this PINOID-binding protein is upregulated by auxin 65, the different PBP1 levels between Col-0 and WS could indicate different auxin levels between the two ecotypes 65, 66. Additional genes identified in Category VI will be discussed in the following section, due to their overlap with previ- ously identified skew gene candidates. Eleven genes remaining across all sets are most likely to be involved in skewing in various processes A subset of most likely candidate genes was identified by the intersection of the list based on growth angle in WS and the list based on comparative gene expression be- tween WS and Col-0 (Fig. 4), with the overlap of the two lists indicated in the Venn diagram, found in Fig. 4a. The list of 92 genes based on growth angle of WS (Fig. 4b; left heat map labeled Physiology ) was com- pared to the list of 128 genes identified between Col-0 and WS (Fig. 4b; right heat map labeled Genotype ), producing 16 genes that appear in both lists (Fig. 4a and b; Y in both Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3). The majority of these 16 genes are found involving A gp135, shown in bold text and dark lines. A gp135 was the growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving in WS, so to have the majority of overlapping genes identified by both the physiological and genotypic comparisons represented in this A gpprovides more support for their involvement in root skewing. These 11 genes are noted as the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC). The 11 HPSGC are involved in many different pro- cesses and were subjected to a thorough literature and expression map search using many available databases, such as Suba3, TAIR, and the Arabidopsis eFP browser 6771. These genes were searched with the goal of finding associations with cell expansion, division, auxin transport, or any process involved with root tropisms, so as to develop insights into their roles in skewing. Sub- organ localizations (e.g. columella cells, root tip, root hairs, etc.) were noted where possible. A summary of these results is found in Table 2. C15MIOX4 is expressed in root hairs, stele, and lateral root cap  71, and digested columella cells have lower transcript abundance in response to auxin  70. Additionally, overexpression of MIOX4 in the presence of L-Ascorbic acid have increased root growth  72.MIOX4 influences root growth responses during stressed conditions  73, but knockouts do not have abnormal cell walls, despite the role of MIOX4 upstream of polysaccharide integration into the cell wall  74.C15PAP24 is not highly expressed in any root zones 6971, but is predicted to be in plant cell walls and to have acid phosphatase and metal ion binding activity  67. C15ASN1 is expressed in root hairs  71a n di nt h e root under phosphate starvation  75.ASN1 is also responsive to darkness and sucrose starvation, and m a yh a v ear o l ei nr e s p o n s et ov i r a li n f e c t i o n s 76. C15At2g25150 is highly expressed in the cortex under normal conditions  71, but is not shown to be auxin responsive  70. In the literature, At2g25150 is described to have a product that is a BAHD enzyme with spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase activity in roots  77 and is upregulated by cytokinin activity  78, which is evidence for its activity in cell division  77. C15SISis not significantly expressed in roots under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the columella cells, root cap, and epidermis of Arabidopsis roots after 1 h of salt stress  79a n d 1 hour at low pH  80.SISis also known to be involved in salt tolerance  67. C15At5g66780 is not expressed in the root under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the root tip at low pH levels and under salt stress  74,80. Under normal conditions, At5g66780 is expressed in all zones along the root epidermis, though not contiguously  71. This gene is unknown; no other published information exists on this gene. C15At3g28310 is expressed in the procambium of the root in the elongation zone  69,71. This gene produces a hypothetical protein with DUF677  67 and is not well studied. C15DIN2 is not expressed in the root under normal condtions, but is upregulated in roots under salt stress  79 and in conditions lacking inorganic phosphate  75.DIN2 mRNA can be transported from cell to cell  81, and is involved in a process that can lead to weakened root cell walls when under salt stress  82. C15SEN1 is expressed in mature and developing root hairs  71, and is downregulated in the presence of auxin  70.SEN1 is regulated by both methyl- jasmonate and salicylic acid  83, and strongly induced by phosphate starvation  84,. Knockout mutants are growth deficient in the light  67. C15SWEET11 is present in the vasculature in the zone of maturation  71, and is downregulated in the cortex of sulfur-deficient roots after 24 h  80.SWEET11 is a known sucrose efflux transporter that can assist with carbon transport to the roots in times of water stress  85. C15HKT1 is expressed in the proto and metaphloem of the zone of maturation in Arabidopsis roots  69,71,Schultz et al. BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 10 of 16and is linked to salt and water stress responses  86. Knockout hkt1 has significantly lower root sugars and higher tricarboxylic acid following salt stress, indicating a role for sugar metabolism in salt stress 86. HKT1 is also regulated by cytokinin  87, and has a close interaction with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 ( ABI4 ; At2g40220), where both gene products are expressed in the same cells and ABI4 binds to sites in the HKT1 promoter  88. The 11 HPSGC show similar expression patterns in that none are particularly expressed in the root tip ver- sus the rest of the root and are all closely related into one co-expression and co-localization network (Fig. 5), despite being members of disparate signaling pathways and potential activities (Table 2). These different signal- ing and environmental sensing pathways, such as salt, sugar, and darkness responses, are linked by their indi- vidual gene members. For example, ASN1 ,SWEET11 , andHKT1 are involved in sucrose response, sugar trans- port, and salt signaling, respectively. These three genes, which are not co-expressed or co-localized with one another, are all co-expressed with a common gene (SWEET12 ; Fig. 5), which further complicates the roles of each gene involved. Other HPSGC are involved with more downstream processes. DIN2 and SIS are involvedin two different environmental sensing and cell signaling processes, are co-localized with one another, and are both co-localized with ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR 9 (ADF9; At4g34970) and PLANT INVERTASEPECTIN METHYLESTERASE 47 (PME47; At5g04970; Fig. 5), both of which are involved in cell wall remodeling. Other genes pulled in by this co-expression and co-localization net- work are related to handling sugar signaling downstream of sensing, such as SUGAR TRANSPORTER 1 (STP1 ; At1g11260) and LIKE SEX4 1 (LSF1 ; At3g01510, where SEX4 is a plant-specific glucan phosphatase; Fig. 5). An additional network file shows the relationship between HPSGC and these additional genes see Additional file 4. This computational approach to the HPSGC illustrates possibilities for how these environmental sensing and sig- naling pathway genes could be involved in the generation of root skewing. Sugar signaling is a major signaling pathway identified in the skew gene candidates. Sucrose efflux transporters SWEET11 andSWEET12 were both upregulated in WS roots grown at A gp45 and 135. SWEET11 ,am e m b e ro f the HPSGC, was also upregulated in Col-0 roots grown at Agp45 (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). These genes are also associated with response to salt stress, diva- lent metal ion transport, and are integral in the endomem- brane system 89, 90. SWEET11 and SWEET12 are Fig. 5 Co-expression and co-localization network of HPSGC shows each member is linked with others. Additionally, other genes pulled into the network are other members of the same signaling networks or downstream cell wall remodeling. Network generated with GeneMANIA 119Schultz et al. BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 11 of 16shown to assist in phloem unloading into the apoplast 91, with SWEET12 responding to CO 2as well 92. This sugar transport could be used for signaling, as other mem- bers of the MtN3 saliva SWEET -family of genes are in- volved with ion transport and physiological process regulation 93. Root exudates are also involved in regula- tion of the surrounding microbiome and microenviron- ment 94, and these SWEET efflux proteins may be involved in shaping root growth and directionality through signaling. Additionally, ASN1 was upregulated in WS roots grown at A gp135 and was downregulated in both Col-0 and WS roots grown at A gp45 (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). ASN1 responds to sucrose starvation, and mRNA accumulation is suppressed with sugar in some tests 95, 96. Additionally, both of these genes are responsive to absence of light, and may be in- volved in lightsugar signaling pathways (Additional file 1: Table S2). It is possible that ASN1 would be involved with the aforementioned SWEET family network. Both DIN2 and ASN1 were upregulated in the presence of various heavy metals, further implicating their roles in environmental signaling pathways 97, with ASN1 be- ing expressed in the elongation and maturation zones in the root 71. Other genes in the HPSGC are involved in sugar sig- naling and subsequent related phosphatase pathways. DIN2 is a dark inducible responsive to sugar starva- tion 96, 98. DIN2 transcript is increased in the ab- sence of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases 96. Though technically a metallo-phosphoesterase and a type 5 acid phosphatase, PAP24 is a member of the HPSGC and may be involved in similar signaling path- ways 99. MIOX4 is suppressed in the shoot by ex- ogenous application of glucose, which my influence root expression through InsP 3signaling cascades 73, w h i c hi t s e l fp l a y sar o l ei nr e s p o n s et og r a v i t r o p i c stimuli 100. SEN1 is another gene induced in roots by phosphate starvation and induced in leaves by a glucose transport inhibitor 101. SEN1 itself may pro- v i d eal i n kb e t w e e ng l u c o s es i g n a l i n ga n dp h o s p h a t e signaling 101, and is highly expressed in the meri- stematic zone of the root 71. Salt signaling is another functional group identified in the HPSGC. HKT1 has a role in salt signaling in Arabi- dopsis roots 102, and is likely involved in loading so- dium ions into phloem to transport to roots, indirectly regulating potassium ion concentrations 86. HKT1 ac- tivity is reduced by high calcium levels 103, 104, which could point to a crosstalk linkage point between calcium and salt signaling pathways. SISalso has a role in salt tolerance, but is mostly unknown at this time 105. Some of these salt-related genes are present in root regions that would imply signaling activity and growth determination. For example, DIN2 is present in thecolumella cells and stele of roots under salt stress, while SISis present in the epidermis, lateral root cap, cortex, and partially present in the endodermis 79. Conclusions This work investigated the transcriptional differences be- tween skewing and non-skewing roots. Comparisons within WS revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth (A gp) during the process of skewing. These genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the WS and Col-0 genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. A majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) are directly associated with environmental sensing (e.g. salt, sugar, hormones, darkness), upstream of physical growth differences (e.g. cell wall remodeling, cell division, cell elongation). Thus, pathways that re- spond to disparate signals from the root local environ- ment may drive the root behavior of skewing. However, it is also possible that some of the HPSGC are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. In order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the HPSGC to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contribut- ing to root skewing. Methods Plants, treatments, and morphometric assays Arabidopsis thaliana plants (wild type cultivars Col-0 and WS) were grown on media plates made from 0.5x MS liquid media, autoclaved with 0.5 Phytagel and poured in square-gridded plates (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Seeds were wet sterilized in 1.7 mL Eppendorf microfuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using a 5-min 70 ethanol wash, followed by a 5 min 50 vv sodium hypochlorate solution wash (8.3; Clorox, Oakland, CA), followed by 6 washes with sterile ddH 2O. Seeds were planted on plates and moved to 4 C for 2 days, followed by three days of vertical growth (A gp 90) in 19 C - 2 C, and 24-h fluorescent light at ap- proximately 80 mol m-2s-1PAR. Plates were photo- graphed, moved to their respective experimental condition (A gp45, 90, or 135), and photographed again on day 8 after germination (day 5 after gravistimulation). Plants were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA). Images of 8 day old plates were stacked, aligned, and measured using JFilament plu- gin for ImageJ 106 108. Root measurements were proc- essed through a custom R script, available on GitHub 109. Data were analyzed using R and two-way ANOVAs with Type II sum of squares 110. Post hoc analysis was conducted using Scheff s method.Schultz et al. BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 Page 12 of 16RNA and microarray Roots were dissected from shoots and RNA was ex- tracted using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Five roots were used for each chip, and three chips were used per condition. Lateral roots were not quantified, but did not appear to be signifi- cantly different between treatments. Initial RNA concen- tration was determined by Eppendorf BioSpectrometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Final RNA concentra- tion was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE) and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioa- nalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA from each sample was re- verse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA, from which biotin-labeled cRNA was generated using the 3  IVT plus Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cRNA was purified using magnetic beads and was fragmented. Following fragmentation, cRNA products (12.5 g) were hybridized with rotation to the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 C. Ar- rays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Initial data analysis was carried out using the MAS5 algorithm within the Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research Microarray Core, University of Florida. The datasets support ing the conclusions of this article are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus re- pository GSE83242. Data processing, comparison tools, and qRT-PCR validation Data were normalized using RMA algorithm using the Limma and Bioconductor packages in R. Differential analyses were processed using R and the Limma package in Bioconductor. Data were imported and organized in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Gene transcripts were significant if absolute value of the fold change was greater than 1 in a base 2 logarithmic scale, as well as a raw p-value cutoff of p 0.05. All genes meeting these criteria were considered, mitigating the risk of false positives with the benefit of identifying as many genes as possible. False discovery rate (FDR)-cor- rection was performed for further statistical power, with q 0.05 being indicated in Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3. For compari- sons between Col-0 and WS cultivars, genes with altered transcripts in all three growth environments were re- moved if the change was near the same magnitude, within  1 fold change (base 2 log scale). Heatmaps were gener- ated using Gene-E (v. 3.0.204, Broad Institute, Cambridge,MA). Gene data was researched using g:Profiler 89, 90, agriGO 111, ATTED-II 112, Biogrid 113, 114, Uni- Prot 115, KEGG 116, 117, and STRING 118 online databases. Additional visualization of gene networks was created using GeneMANIA 119. For qRT-PCR validation of transcriptome microarray data, 460 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers used were PAP24 (F: 5 ACACGATTGGAGAGAAGG CA 3;R :5 AACCAAGGACACGATGAGCT 3), SEN1 (F: 5 AGGAAATGTTGCAGCAGAGG 3;R : 5CGTTGATGGCTCTAGTCGGA 3),ASN1 (F: - GGAATATTTGGGGACGGTGC 3;R :5 CGGGAC ATCAAGAACATCGG 3), and HKT1 (F: 5 TCTTG GAGTGACGGTGCTAG 3;R :5 CAGAGGTCCA TTCAAAGGCG 3). The cDNA was analyzed by qRT- PCR using SYBR Green reagents and was normalized to UBQ11 prior to the internal vertical control comparison or the Col-0 to WS comparison.

        "conclusion": "s: This study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing. Keywords: Transcriptomics, Root skewing, Root waving, Morphometrics, Microarray, Arabidopsis thaliana Background Plant roots have been long studied and yet investigations of root behavior, physiology, and biochemistry continue to be actively explored on every level 1 6. The work presented here seeks further insights into root growth strategies by focusing on two distinct growth patterns of root growth, skewing and waving. Skewing is when the steady-state growth direction of a root deviates from the direction of the gravity vector and waving is when the root undulates back and forth over time along its direc- tion of growth 7 14. Skewing and waving have been described as gravity-enhanced touch responses, since these root patterns are notably present when a plant isgrown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. Current models require that gravity pulls the root tip down onto the tilted surface, which increases the mechanical impedance to growth, and results in root skewing and root waving 15. However, recent spaceflight experiments with Ara- bidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) on the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that certain ecotypes have roots that deviate from vertical growth (at a magni- tude similar to skewing on the ground) and wave in the absence of gravity 16 18. These ecotypes that exhibit spaceflight skewing are also the ecotypes that exhibit ter- restrial skewing when grown at an angle 16 18. The degree of skewing in spaceflight was consistent with pre- vious terrestrial observations, but the waving pattern was different from what was typically observed on the ground 17. The causes of skewing and subsequently, the genes involved are currently unknown. The goal of this study is to discover which genes are associated with root skewing through transcription microarrays.

BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:31 DOI 10.1186s12870-017-0975-9Other root tropisms exist as a result of environmental interaction, which likely impact the degree of root skew- ing and root waving. Touch responses, or thigmotrop- ism, involves many genes that interact with auxin and can subsequently alter growth patterns 11, 19 28. Plants also determine their growth in relation to the gravity vector, resulting in a gravitropic set-point angle (GSA), which is most commonly associated with lateral organ growth relative to the primary organ 29. GSA is driven by auxin and TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RE- SPONSE 1AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1AFB)- dependent signaling, in a process similar to gravitropism 3032. Light can alter GSA for different plant systems 33, and light in general plays a role in root patterning and growth direction 34 42. Additional tropisms in- clude halotropism 39, 43, 44, chemotropism 45, hydrotropism 46, all of which can alter root growth response (reviewed in 3). Many hypotheses exist for the underlying molecular mechanisms and key genes responsible for root skewing and root waving. As a result, a wide variety of genes have been implicated as involved in these growth pat- terns. Hormone related pathways and processes are among the candidates, such as ethylene involvement in root waving 10 and auxin and tryptophan biosynthesis in both skewing and waving 47, 48. The cytoskeleton is also involved in skewing and waving 7, 18, 49, 50, in- cluding WAVE-DAMPENED 2 (WVD2 ; At5g28646) and WVD2-LIKE 1 (WDL1 ; At3g04630) genes, which alter cell expansion through microtubule bundle organization 51. Many genes involved in molecular patterning, sig- naling, phosphorylation, and cell wall structure are also involved in root skewing and waving. Guanosine triphos- phate (GTP)-binding proteins 11, cell expansion gene ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 3 (RHD3 ; At3g13870) with putative GTP-binding motif 13, CLAVATA -related genes 52, protein phosphatasePP2A ENHANCED ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1 (RCN1 ; At1g25490; 53), serinethreonine protein kinases WAG1 and WAG2 (At1g53700 and At3g14370, respectively; 54), and KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1 (KNAT1 ; At4g08150; 55) are all associated with mor- phological change in root skewing or root waving. The SKU family of genes were identified through phenotypic changes in root behavior, with SKU5 (At4g12420) and related genes being involved with cell wall modification and root growth 56 and SKU6 (At2g03680) and family being involved with cortical microtubule and directional cell expansion 50. While no single pathway has been identified in the literature as responsible for root skew- ing or for root waving, several different pathways have evidence for being involved. Skewing and waving are functionally separable using genetics 7, 12, 13, 51, 57. The physiological separationof skewing from waving within a ecotype can be accom- plished by using the environment, particularly the tilt angle of the growth plate, and can also occur in space- flight 16 18. The degree to which growth plates are tilted is referred to as the Angle of the growth plate (Agp). Typically, plates are tilted backward such that plants are above the media surface, at A gp45. For many Arabidopsis ecotypes, growth at A gp45 results in roots that both skew and wave. When growth plates are tilted forward, such that plants are below the media surface, at Agp135, Arabidopsis roots skew with reduced waving, similar to the pattern observed in spaceflight. Growth plates held vertically are A gp90 and are considered as the controls for growth angle, as roots on vertical plates generally do not skew or wave. This study aims to discover additional genes associated with root skewing through transcription microarray ana- lyses of Arabidopsis roots exhibiting different patterns of waving and skewing. Gene expression profiles were derived from Arabidopsis that displayed different root growth behaviors in various growth environments in order to identify gene activities associated with skewing and waving. Identified genes were validated using qRT- PCR and evaluated using previous studies for likelihood of involvement with the skewing process.",
