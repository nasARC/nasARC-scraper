Introduction Withthecurrentpaucityofopportunitiesforstudyingwhole animal mammalian physiology in space flight, the Biospec-imen Sharing Program (BSP) for postflight tissue collection offerstheopportunitytobroadenaccesstobiologicalsamples shortly after return and maximize the data generated fromflight animal payloads. The logistics of space flight experi-mentsinvolvingliveanimalsoftenrequiresharvestingtissues at a remote site, followed by shipping the specimens to thePrincipleInvestigatorslaboratoriesfordetailedanalysis.Fur-thermore,asthecapabilitiestohouserodentandotheranimalsontheInternationalSpacestation(ISS),andtoconductlong-termspaceflightexperimentsusinganimalsareenabled,theneed to harvest and fix tissues for long-term storage on ISS thatwillretainhighqualityRNAandproteinforsubsequent analysis in laboratories on Earth is also required. These approaches to live animal experimentation in space flightthat include tissue harvest for multiple investigators requiredeterminationof(1)tissue-specificwindowsoftimebetween euthanasiaandtissuefixationthatretainqualityofhistology and(2)tissue-specificwindowsoftimefortissuefixationthatretainhighqualityproteinandRNAforsubsequentanalysis.Determination of these windows provides a quantitative, l o g i c a la p p r o a c ht og e n e r a t ea p p r o p r i a t e l yp r i o r i t i z e da n d optimized tissue harvest and fixation logistics in a multi-investigatorBiospecimenSharingProgramscenario,beitonEarth or during tissue harvest on the ISS. In addition, tissueHindawi Publishing Corporation BioMed Research International Volume 2015, Article ID 475935, 12 pages http:dx.doi.org10.115520154759352 BioMedResearchInternational storage methods should retain high sample quality under long-termstorage,assamplesmaybeharvestedandstoredonthe ISS but may not be returned to Earth for many months,depending on ISS to Earth flight frequency and payloadcapacities.Thisissuehasbeenaddressedforpreservingplantmaterial for gene expression analysis  1, but there is no data available for animal tissues. Our participation in the BSP program involved tissue harvest from female mice atKennedySpaceCenter,Florida,USA(KSC)foranimalsflownfor1215daysinorbitonthreespaceshuttleflights:STS-131,STS-133,andSTS-135.Inaddition,weharvestedtissuesfrommale mice at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP)laboratory in Moscow, RU for animals flown for 30 daysin orbit on the BION M1 satellite. Both the STS and BIONseries of flight experiments involved age- and time-matchedground control groups of animals. During the early flightplanning phase of BION, there were possibilities that maleo rf e m a l em i c ew o u l db efl o w na n dt h a tm a l eg e r b i lt i s s u e smayalsobeprovidedtotheBSP .Thus,tobepreparedforanyofthesepossibilities,weundertooktodeterminetheoptimaltissueharvestwindowsforallofthespeciesandreproductivetissues that we might be able to obtain. Our participationinthesemulti-investigatorspecimensharingeffortscoveringfour different primary flight PI experimental designs andharvestlogisticsnecessitatedadeterminationofthewindowof time between euthanasia and harvest and preservation ofourtissuesofinterestthatwouldallowussufficientflexibilitytoobtainthehighestpossiblequalityoftissueforhistopathol-ogy, RNA for gene-transcription analysis, and protein forexpression and posttranslational modification analysis. A determination of these time windows is essential, since the tissues that are made available to the BSP investigators areprovidedafter theprimaryflight PIs have obtainedtheir tis-sues.Knowledgeoftheoptimalwindowsforallofthetissuesof interest aids in the preparation of targeted tissue harvestflowlogisticsthatcanprovideeachoftheBSPteammembersthe highest possible quality tissue, respectively. Therefore, aswe report here, we developed a strategy to determine thewindowoftimebetweeneuthanasiaandfixationforretentionof high quality histology for male and female reproductiveorgans. We also determined methods for long-term tissuestorage for 10 months that provide for recovery of both highquality protein and RNA. These strategies are adaptable andcan be applied to harvest andstorage ofothertime-sensitivelabile tissues from animals and plants. Furthermore, thesemethodscanbeusedtooptimizelogisticsanddatacollectionundermulti-investigatortissueharvestandsharingprogramsoperated by any space agency, commercial entity, or flightplatform. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals. Approximately 8 wk old male and female C57Bl6J(JacksonLab,BarHarbor,ME)and 10-monthold maleandfemaleMongoliangerbils(CharlesRiver,Wilming-t o n ,M A )w e r eu s e dt h r o u g h o u tt h i ss t u d y .A l la n i m a lu s eprotocols were approved by the University of Kansas Insti-tutionalAnimalCareandUseCommittee(IACUC).Animalswere maintained in standard cages with 12:12h dark:light cycle,andstandardfoodandwaterwereprovidedadlibitum.All animals were euthanized using CO 2asphyxiation fol- lowedbycervicaldislocationpriortotissueharvest. 2.2.DeterminationoftheLimitofTimeand TemperaturebetweenEuthanasiaandTissueFixation 2.2.1. Male Mice. Our protocol consisted of three groups of sixmiceeac h,wi tho nemo usef o reac htimepo in t.I ngr o u pA, all mice were euthanized at one time and the testes andepididymideswereharvestedandseparatedandthenimme-diately placed in Hams F-10 medium (Sigma Aldrich, St.Louis,MO) onice.Attimeintervalsof0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,and 2.5hreachtestis(onemousepertimepoint)andepididymis(2 mice per time point) were separated and then transferredfromHamsF-10mediumtoBouinsfixative(SigmaAldrich,St. Louis, MO) at room temperature (RT; 21 C). In group B, the same procedure was followed, except that the testes andepididymides,separated,wereplacedinHamsF-10mediumat RTuntil transfer to Bouins at the same time interval as above.IngroupC,allmicewereeuthanizedatonetime,thecarcassesweremaintainedat(RT) ,andthenattime0,0.5,1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5hr, the testis and epididymis were harvestedfrom the carcasses, respectively. At each of the time pointsabove,groupCtesteswereplacedinBouinssolutionandpro-cessedasperstandardhistologyprotocols,asdetailedbelow.For all groups, the tissues fixed in Bouins were processed asdetailedinSection 2.3,belo w .A tthesa metimepo in t,gr o u p C epididymides were processed to obtain cauda sperm to assess sperm motility by computer assisted sperm analysis(CASA)  2 .F o ra n i m a l su s e df o rc o l l e c t i o no fc a u d ae p i - didymalspermformotilityanalysis,twoanimalswereusedateachtimepoint. 2.2.2. Female Mice. Female mice were euthanized (carcasses maintainedatRTaspergroupC,above)andtheirovariesanduteriwereharvestedat0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,and3.0hraftereuthanasia (one animal per time point). At the times indi-cated, the tissues were fixed at RT in Bouins overnight andthenprocessedforhistologyasdetailedbelow(Section 2.3). 2.2.3. Mongolian Gerbils. The six male gerbils were euth- anized at one time, and the carcasses were kept at roomtemperature.At0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,and3.0hraftereuthanasia,testis and epididymis were harvested from the carcasses andseparated,respectively(oneanimalpertimepoint).Similarly,allsixfemalegerbilswereeuthanizedandthecarcasseswere kept at RT. Ovaries and uterine horns were harvested from each carcass at the same time interval as the males.

Testes and epididymides from the mature mice were harvested, asBioMedResearchInternational 3 detailed above. Unless indicated otherwise, all procedures were done at RT. Tissues were fixed in Bouins solution for48h, washed in 70 ethanol (ETOH) until the yellow colorofBouinsdisappeared(48hrwithfrequentchangesof70 ETOH and gentle agitation), and divided into four groups:Control group : tissue was stored in 70 ETOH until paraffin embedding; Rapid transition :7 0 E T O Hw a si m m e d i a t e l y replaced with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), pH 7.4for one wk, and then rapidly replaced with 70 ETOH;Slow Re-ETOH only : 70 ETOH was immediately replaced with PBS for one wk and then sequentially replaced at 2hrintervals with each of 10, 30, 50, and 70 ETOH; Slow rehydration-dehydration : 70 ETOH was sequentially (70, 50, 30, 10, then PBS, at 2hr each) substitutedwith PBSfor one wk and then replaced at 2hr intervals with each of10, 30, 50, and 70 ETOH. To prevent contamination,we kept tissue in PBS at 4 C, and ETOH replacement was completed at RT with 2hr intervals between changes, asdetailedabove.Aftereachoftherespectivefinaldehydrationsteps above, the tissues were paraffin-embedded and pro-cessedforhistologyandhematoxylinandeosinstaining(HE)usingstandardmethodsasperformedpreviously 3. 2.4.

The tissue was removed from RNA later,b r i e fl yr i n s e d with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then homogenized in RIPAbuffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (all from SigmaA l d r i c h ,S t .L o u i s ,M O )o rP r o t e o J e tM a m m a l i a nC e l lL y s i sReagent (Fermentas, Pittsburgh, PA). Uteri from STS-135mission mice were preserved in RNA laterfor 10 months at 80 C, prior to processing in RIPA as described above.

In control testicular tissue (Figure 4(a)), all types of spermatogenic cells, sper- matogonia (Sp), Sertoli cells (Se), spermatocytes (Sc), andspermatids (Sd), were evident. Lymphatic spaces between seminiferoustubulesandadjacenttoLeydigcells(L)clusters are clearly defined. After the slow rehydration-dehydrationstepwise replacement with ETOH, testis tubules appearednormal with histological architecture similar to the controlgroup(Figure 4(b)).Althoughalltypesofspermatogeniccell were identified after slow rehydration-dehydration stepwisereplacement,spermatogoniaandSertolicellnucleiweremoredifficult to distinguish compared to control. The quality oftesticular histologyobserved after slow Re-ETOH only(Fig-ure4(c))wassimilartothatobservedintheslowrehydration- dehydration stepwise replacement group. However, openspaces (black arrows) were observed within portions ofseminiferous tubules in the slow Re-ETOH only group, andthe seminiferous tubule basement membrane in this groupoften appeared wavy and thinner (yellow arrows) comparedtothecontrol(Figure 4(a)).Thehistologicqualitywaspoorin the group treated by single step (rapid transition) change ofsolution(Figure 4(d)),asevidencedbyadiffuseappearanceof t h et i s s u e( n o td u et of o c u s )a n dl i m i t e dc l a r i t yo fn u c l e a rdetails in spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.

Discussion We report here a logical method to determine the optimaltime window of tissue harvest and fixation after euthanasiafor use in multi-investigator tissue harvest programs that iscompatible with processing of tissue sample obtained fromspace flight animals. We also demonstrate here a long-termstorage regimenforanimaltissues compatiblewith recoveryofhighqualityRNAandproteinunderconditionssimilartothat on the ISS, when there may be many months betweensample collection and return to Earth.

Our participation in the BSP program involved tissue harvest from female mice atKennedySpaceCenter,Florida,USA(KSC)foranimalsflownfor1215daysinorbitonthreespaceshuttleflights:STS-131,STS-133,andSTS-135.Inaddition,weharvestedtissuesfrommale mice at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP)laboratory in Moscow, RU for animals flown for 30 daysin orbit on the BION M1 satellite. Both the STS and BIONseries of flight experiments involved age- and time-matchedground control groups of animals. During the early flightplanning phase of BION, there were possibilities that maleo rf e m a l em i c ew o u l db efl o w na n dt h a tm a l eg e r b i lt i s s u e smayalsobeprovidedtotheBSP .Thus,tobepreparedforanyofthesepossibilities,weundertooktodeterminetheoptimaltissueharvestwindowsforallofthespeciesandreproductivetissues that we might be able to obtain.

A determination of these time windows is essential, since the tissues that are made available to the BSP investigators areprovidedafter theprimaryflight PIs have obtainedtheir tis-sues.Knowledgeoftheoptimalwindowsforallofthetissuesof interest aids in the preparation of targeted tissue harvestflowlogisticsthatcanprovideeachoftheBSPteammembersthe highest possible quality tissue, respectively. Therefore, aswe report here, we developed a strategy to determine thewindowoftimebetweeneuthanasiaandfixationforretentionof high quality histology for male and female reproductiveorgans. We also determined methods for long-term tissuestorage for 10 months that provide for recovery of both highquality protein and RNA. These strategies are adaptable andcan be applied to harvest andstorage ofothertime-sensitivelabile tissues from animals and plants.
