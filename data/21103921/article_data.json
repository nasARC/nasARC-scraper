We examined the effects of lycopene and sh oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveil-lance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or sh oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -2) gene expression, respectively, reecting putative proliferation ( IGF-1) and inammatory ( COX -2) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis.Methods We conducted a 3-month randomized, double- blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression proles (assessed by qRTPCR) among menwith favorable-risk prostate ca ncer receiving either 30 mgday lycopene, 3 gday sh oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapen- taenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acid s) or placebo. Results Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to sh, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF-1expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms ( p0.93) nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and sh arms ( p0.99). Conclusion Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or sh oil did not signicantly change IGF-1 andCOX -2gene expression in the normal prostate micro- environment in men with low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression proles may shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutri-ents in prostate cancer. Keywords Prostate cancer C1Active surveillance C1 Fish oil C1Lycopene C1Randomized clinical trial Introduction Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in US men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), with 192,000 newcases and 27,000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2009 1. However, the natural history of this disease is remarkably heterogeneous and not completely understood.In the United States, 90 of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when they are of localregional stage  1, and the majority of cases are indicated for biopsy by an elevatedprostate-specic antigen (PSA) level only  2.

Surgery or radiation remains the most common primary management strategies for early stage prostate cancer;however, both options are associated with decreases in urinary and sexual function  4. Active surveillance (AS) (also called delayed treatment) is becoming recognized as an alternative for many patients with early stage low- grade disease (low burden disease). AS involves closemonitoring via PSA tests, digital rectal examinations, and prostate biopsies, to delay or avoid denitive treatment and the associated comorbidities. Standard clinical interven-tions are offered at early signs of progression. Although data remain limited and randomized clinical trials are ongoing, some  3,5 but not all  6 observational reports of populations followed with AS or delayed treatment indi- cate that men experienced comparable outcomes to those with similar stage and grade disease who elected treatmentimmediately, although furthe r research with longer follow-up is needed  7. Our collaborative group established a program for men with low-burden prostate cancer who opt for AS to be offered participation in diet and lifestyle intervention research  810. Observational epidemiologic studies sug- gest that dietary factors may impact prostate cancer pro- gression. We previously reported that greater intakes of sh and tomato sauce after diagnosis of prostate cancer wereassociated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer recur- renceprogression among 1,202 prostate cancer survivors 11. Tomatoes are rich in the carotenoid lycopene, which may have antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inam- matory actions  12 and inuence the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis  1317 that has been implicated in prostate cancer  18. Fish is rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that may have anti-inammatory protective effects against prostate cancer, possibly through the inhi-bition of COX -211,1923. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that lycopene and sh oil supplements would benecially affect gene expression inputative cancer-related pathways ( IGF-1,IGF-1R, and COX -2) in normal prostate tissue of men on AS. Methods Study design The Molecular Effects of Nutritional Supplements Trial (MENS) was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-con- trolled 3-month clinical trial of lycopene and sh oil witheach compared to a placebo. The three study arms were as follows: two 15 mg lycopene soft gel capsules daily (Lyc-O-Mato C210donated by, Lycored, Israel); three 1 g sh oil capsules daily (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic(EPA) and 549 mg docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acid; manufactured by Perfect Source, Fullerton, CA with active ingredient donated by Roche Vitamins, Parsippany, NJ);or placebo (provided by the respective manufacturers of the active pills for lycopene and sh oil). The lycopene supplement was a whole-food supplement made from tomatoes and standardized to deliver 30 mg of lycopene in a soy oil base. The placebo for lycopene was isocaloric andcontained soy oil but no lycopene. The placebo for the sh oil supplement was isocaloric and contained olive oil. Men received lycopene ?placebo for sh oil (lycopene arm), sh oil ?placebo for lycopene (sh oil arm), or placebo for lycopene ?placebo for sh oil (placebo arm). All men were also given a standard daily multivitamin (that did notcontain lycopene or sh oil; DixonAkyma) and instructed to refrain from any other types of vitamin or nutritional supplements during the intervention. Baseline self-reported data on usual tomato and sh intake were used to stratify patients to ensure a balanced distribution of initial dietary levels among the three studyarms. Baseline intake of these foods was assessed using questions and category denitions from a validated food frequency questionnaire  2427 that was also used in our prior observational study  11. The four strata were dened by the combinations of low or high tomato and low or high sh intakes (i.e., 4 servingsweek tomato products  high;2 servingsweek sh high  11). Study participants, eligibility criteria, and enrollmentThis study was conducted among men with low-burden prostate cancer, choosing AS for disease management, andwho met the following criteria: histologically documented prostate adenocarcinoma, extended pattern biopsy within 2 years of enrollment with a Gleason sum six or lower withno pattern four or ve, no more than 33 of biopsy cores positive for cancer, no more than 50 of the length of a tumor core involved by carcinoma, three serum PSA levelsdone at least 2 weeks apart over the year prior to ran- domization and all PSA levels 10 ngml, life expectancy 3 months, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance score 2, and the ability to understand and willingness to sign a consent document. The following a priori exceptions were allowed: PSA 15 ngml for men with concurrent benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis, having a Gleason score of four reported only in a micro- focus of tumor (dened as  2 mm length) and having 33 positive biopsy cores due to a tumor microfocus. These criteria were consistent with the clinical standards of142 Cancer Causes Control (2011) 22:141150 123our institution for determining the candidates for AS and were approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). In a single case, one participant had an initial eligibility biopsy (14-cores) with 36 positive cores. With thepatients consent we requested permission from our IRB to proceed with the rst baseline study biopsy for nal determination of eligibility. This participant had no evi-dence of cancer in his four-core research biopsy and was allowed to continue on the study. Exclusion criteria were as following: no prior or con- current treatment for prostate cancer, patients with a PSA doubling time 3 months (PSA doubling time ln2slope of ln PSA over time,  28), use of lycopene, sh oil or any other dietary or nutritional supplement within 4 weeks of study entry, use of Finasteride, Dutasteride, Saw Palmettoor any other herbalnutritional preparation indicated to affect hormone levels within 4 weeks of study entry, use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors andor aspirin for more than7 days over the 1 month prior to study, history of allergic reactions attributed to tomatoes, sh, soybean or olive oil, gelatin capsules, or compounds of similar chemical orbiologic composition to lycopene (carotenoids) or sh oil, and uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing infection, congestive heart failure,unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric condition that would limit compliance with study require- ments. Men who wanted to participate but who were on anutritional supplement or anti-inammatory drug were assessed by their doctors regarding whether abstaining from the supplement or drug was deemed medically safeand if so they were asked to undergo a 4-week washout period before proceeding with the study. Compliance with the study protocol was assessed via self-report and reviewof the medical records and food diaries. Usage of any dietary or nutritional supplement, nasteride, dutasteride, or anti-inammatory drug during the 3-month interventionwas considered a protocol violation, and men were with- drawn from the study when such usage was discovered. All potentially eligible men were identied at the Uro- logic Oncology clinic at the Helen Diller Family Com- prehensive Cancer Center by physician(s) and nurse practitioners. This trial was advertised via Dear Doctorletters to urologist colleagues in the Northern California region, local newspaper ads, brief radio announcements, and iers handed out at local health-promotion, cancer- orprostate cancer-related outreach events. Clinical procedures and data collectionBefore the intervention, men provided medical history and underwent physical and digital rectal exams. The studyurologist (KS) performed an ultrasound-guided four-core research biopsy to procure fresh tissue for RNA analysis.After the intervention, the study urologist performed a second research biopsy. All biopsies were reviewed by the study pathologist (JS) to determine gradeextent of disease and verify that patients still met the criteria for continuingAS. After the intervention, men were followed according to a standard AS protocol, including medical history, physical exam, digital rectal exam, and PSA test at three, six, nine,twelve, and 24 months. Participants also completed a val- idated  24 semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline and 12 months, and quality-of-life surveys at baseline and 3 months. To encourage and assess compli- ance, food diaries were also collected before each studybiopsy and once during the midpoint of the intervention. Study outcomeThe two primary outcomes were changes in normal tissue gene expression between the baseline and 3-month biopsiesinIGF-1and in COX -2. Change in gene expression for each supplement arm was compared with change in the placebo arm. Our primary hypotheses were that lycopenesupplement would decrease IGF-1expression and that sh oil supplementation would decrease COX -2expression, each compared to placebo. We also hypothesized (sec-ondarily) that IGF-1Rexpression would be decreased by lycopene versus placebo. In exploratory analyses, change in PSA level after the intervention was also compared. Biopsy processing Core needle biopsies were collected at baseline and 3 months. Total RNA for RTPCR and micro-array analyses were extracted from areas of normal prostate peripheral-zone tissue containing both stroma and epithelial cells. qRT-PCR was conducted at the end of the trial to minimize inter-assay variability. qRT-PCR Hundred nanogram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using Quantas Qscript reverse transcription kit. PCR was conducted in triplicate (5 ng cDNA per reaction) with20 ml reaction volumes of 1X Taqman buffer (1X Applied Biosystems PCR buffer, 20 glycerol, 2.5 gelatin, 60nM Rox as a passive reference), 5.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM eachprimer, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 200 nM probe, and 0.025 unitml AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) with 5 ng cDNA. The primers andprobes were mixed together and added to the master mix and cDNA in the 384-well plate. PCR was conducted on the ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) using the followingcycle parameters: 1 cycle of 95 C176for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95C176for 15 s, 60 C176for 1 min. Analysis was carried outCancer Causes Control (2011) 22:141150 143 123using the SDS software (version 2.3) supplied with the ABI 7900HT to determine the Ct values of each reaction. Ct values determined for triplicate reactions involving a test gene and a housekeeping gene (GUSB) were averagedand subtracted to obtain the DDCt (DDCtDCt 3mo DCt 0mo (Ct test gene 3moCt GUSB 3mo)-(Ct test gene 0moCt GUSB 0mo)). Disease progressionDisease progression was dened as a PSA doubling time of 12 months  28, any adverse pathological ndings on biopsy (Gleason sum 6, any evidence of pattern 4 or 5, involvement of 50 of any core, or 50 cores positive) or other incidental evidence of clinical progression (i.e.,positive bone scans or lymph node biopsies). Any patient exhibiting progression during the 24-month study was withdrawn and offered standard treatment. Patients couldalso withdraw from the protocol at any time for any reason and be treated off study. Statistical considerations Sample sizeTo evaluate the two primary study hypotheses, patients were randomized with equal probability to one of the three studyarms: lycopene, sh oil, or control. The stratication cohort was determined using the patients self-reported intake of tomato products (i.e., primary source of lycopene) and sh,and patients were randomized within each of the four strata (high or low level for each dietary factor). The study was designed to test for a 2-fold decrease in expression of IGF-1 andCOX -2following the 3-month intervention compared with placebo. Accrual of 29 patients to each of the three arms was sufcient to detect a 40 difference in the proportion ofpatients with a 2-fold decrease in the expression of the IGF-1 gene with lycopene or in the COX-2 gene with sh oil, each compared with placebo, using Fishers exact test. The powerof each test was 0.81 with a directional level of signicance of 0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. In addition to comparing the proportion of patients displaying a decrease inthe delta cycle threshold ( DCT) for the two genes of interest, this sample size was sufcient to detect an effect size of at least 0.75 for the difference between arms in the DDCT means using a t test with the same error assumptions. The total planned accrual of 97 patients allowed for a 10 loss by the 3 month biopsy. Methods for analysis Baseline characteristics were compared among the three study arms using analysis of variance methods (ANOVA)for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. To test the two primary hypotheses to detect a decrease in the mean changes in IGF-1 (orCOX-2 ) gene expression between the lycopene (or sh oil) and placeboarms a t statistic was used with signicance set at a prob- ability 0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. The same method was used to test for a decrease in IGF-1Rwith the lycopene supplement without any adjustment for multiple testing. We used Fishers exact test to determine whether a greater proportion of patients on the supplement arm achieved at least a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1(orCOX -2) expression when compared with the placebo group. We conducted exploratory analyses using 2-way ANOVA methods to investigate the change in gene expression (pre to post-intervention) in DCT on the log 2 scale due to the study arm (supplement or placebo), base- line tomatosh intake (high or low) or their interaction. If statistical signicance was observed, the Newman-Keulspost hoc test was used to identify which subsets were signicantly different. Mean baseline and change from baseline results were presented on the log 2scale. Results Between October 2003 and December 2007, 97 men were enrolled (Fig. 1). A total of 13 men were excluded from the primary analyses for the following reasons: never started protocol intervention ( n2), ineligible ( n5), protocol violation (taking nutritional supplements) ( n1), opted for active treatment after randomization ( n1), experi- enced disease progression prior to the 3-month follow-up biopsy ( n2), and experienced disease progression based on the 3-month biopsy ( n2) (Fig. 1). The remaining 84 participants comprised the current study sample. Three unexpected adverse events were observed during theintervention and classied as possibly related to study treatment. These occurred among participants randomized to lycopene and included indigestion ( n2) and migraine headache ( n1). Participants were not different with regard to baseline demographic or clinical variables or intake of tomato orsh across treatment arms (Table 1). The mean age and body mass index at randomization was 61 years (standard deviation 7.8 years) and 26.8 kgm 2(standard deviation 4.6 kgm2), respectively. There was adequate RNA quality and quantity from the normal prostate tissue to assess the expression via RT-PCRfor 74 patients at baseline and 79 patients at the 3-month follow-up. Pre- and post-intervention RT-PCR analyses were performed for 69 patients with approximately one-third treated on each of the 3 study arms (22 lycopene;144 Cancer Causes Control (2011) 22:141150 12321 sh; 26 placebo). These 69 men were similar to the 15 not analyzed with regard to baseline clinical and demographic characteristics (data not shown). We compared the baselineDCTs for IGF-1, COX-2, and IGF-1R among the three study arms and observed no signicant differences and no pair-wise differences between the study arms (Table 2). The mean DCT at baseline for COX-2 for all subsets was noticeably higher compared with the other two genes. The supplement and placebo arms did not differ for all threegenes when analyzed by the level of baseline tomato or sh intakes. As might be expected, if gene expression reected nutritional intake, there was a signicant difference in theDCTs between the high and low baseline tomato intake (p0.02) and for sh intake ( p0.02) but there was no interaction between stratication level and study arm. After the 3-month interventions, there was no difference in the change in IGF-1(p0.93) or IGF-1R(p0.53) expression between the placebo and lycopene supplement arms. There was virtually no change in COX -2 expression for the placebo and sh oil supplement groups comparingthe 3 month versus baseline levels ( p0.99) (Table 3). Only 27 of the lycopene arm achieved a 2-fold decrease inIGF-1 compared with 23 for the placebo ( p0.75). Thirty percent of the sh oil arm experienced a 2-fold decrease in COX-2 expression compared with 15 of the placebo group but this was not statistically signicantlydifferent ( p0.29). Similarly, no difference in the pro- portion displaying a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1R expressionoccurred for the lycopene and placebo arms (14 and 8, respectively; p0.65). Exploratory subgroup analyses of the magnitude of change in gene expression by study arm and by baseline stratication were performed. Overall, there was no dif- ference in the change in IGF-1 levels with lycopene sup- plement compared with the placebo (ANOVA p0.72) but a signicantly greater change on average was observed among those with an initial high tomato intake comparedwith a low intake (132.6 vs. 67.7 (anti-log), respectively; p0.01) (Fig. 2a). Even though a greater mean increase was observed for those with high tomato intake initially,there was no statistical difference between the low- and high-intake subsets in mean IGF-1levels for each study arm (Newman-Keuls: Placebo p 0.16; Lycopene p 0.11). No differences between study arms or highlow tomato strata were observed for IGF-1R(data not shown). Similarly, no differences between the sh supplement and placebo arms in mean change in COX-2 levels occurred (ANOVA p0.78; Fig. 2b). This was also true when the baseline sh intake was low or high (Newman-Keuls p0.70 and p0.86, respectively) with a narrow range for the change among the four subsets, 57.497.5 onaverage. These results may reect the possible limited magnitude of change that could be observed with the study sh oil supplement. There was no difference in the change in PSA level after the intervention, comparing the lycopene or sh oil armsAssessed for eligibility (n 240) Excluded (n 13) Not meeting inclusion criteria (n 5) Voluntary Withdrawal (n 3) Withdrawn due to disease progression (n 4) Withdrawn due to protocol violation (n1) Randomized to Lycopene (n 29) Randomized to Placebo (n 28) 97 Enrolled Randomized to Fish Oil (n 27) Analyzed (n 22) Insufficient RNA quality or quantity (n7)Analyzed (n 21) Insufficient RNA quality or quantity (n6)Analyzed (n 26) Insufficient RNA quality or quantity (n2)Fig. 1 Molecular effects of nutritional supplements trialenrollment schematicCancer Causes Control (2011) 22:141150 145 123versus the placebo group (mean change in PSA: -0.46 ng ml for placebo, 0.53 ngml for lycopene; 0.20 ngml for sh; pvalue 0.26 and 0.39, respectively). Discussion This novel randomized clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility and safety of studying the effects of nutritionalsupplements on the prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer on AS. These results indicated no decrease in the gene expression of IGF-IorIGF-1R with 3-month lycopene supplement compared with placeboand no evidence of a decrease in COX -2gene expression for sh oil supplement versus placebo.

Studies of lycopene or tomato intake in men with prostate cancer have also generally supported possible benets. We previously reported that men who increased their post-diagnostic consumption oftomato sauce by two servings per week had an estimated 20 reduction in the risk of prostate cancer recurrence or progression ( pvalue 0.04), independent of baseline clinical features and primary treatment option  11. Chen et al. reported favorable reductions in leukocyte and prostate tissue DNA oxidative damage and PSA levels among 32 men with prostate cancer who received 1 tomato sauce serving daily for 3 weeks  29. Schroeder et al. observed a favorable PSA response among 49 men with prostate cancer and post-treatment rising PSA levels who then received a combination dietary supplement thatincluded soy, isoavones, lycopene, silymarin, and other antioxidants  30. This latter study, however, was unable to distinguish if the effect was due to lycopene alone or othercomponents of the supplement. Preclinical and some  13 17,31 but not all  3234 human studies have supported the hypothesis that at least one mechanism by whichlycopene protects against prostate cancer is by affecting IGF-1 levels or the IGF- axis. Prior epidemiologic reports by us and others suggested a possible benet of sh intake or marine omega-3 fatty acids on prostate cancer incidence, recurrence, or mortality 11,3537; although several studies of sh intake have also observed null associations with prostate cancer  36, 3842. Several in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids, or a greateromega-3:omega-6 fatty acid ratio, may have inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cell growth or xenograft tumor weight and in some of these models, this was accompaniedby an observed down-regulation of COX-2 11,1923.Table 3 Mean change from baseline post-intervention in qRTPCR (normalized to GUSb) gene expression for IGF-1, COX -2, and IGF-1R aOne participant randomized to sh oil had an un-evaluable result for COX -2at 3 months bComparisons of the change in DCT were between the placebo and Lycopene arms for IGF-1 andIGF-1Rand between the placebo and sh oil arms for COX-2Mean change ( SD) from baseline in gene expression IGF-1 COX -2 IGF -1R Treatment Lycopene ( n22) 0.05 1.32 NA 0.20 3.00 Fish oil ( n20) NA 0.39 1.98aNA Placebo ( n26) 0.02 1.22 0.40 2.19 0.74 2.86 Prob. valueb0.93 0.99 0.53 StraticationLow tomatolow sh ( n21) a0.39 1.21 0.42 2.59 1.15 3.10 Low tomatohigh sh ( n8) 0.68 0.95 0.12 1.01 0.22 0.53 High tomatolow sh ( n25) -0.02 1.16 0.20 2.41 0.10 3.38 High tomatohigh sh ( n14) -0.40 1.29 0.37 0.84 -0.16 0.61 Fig. 2 a Mean change from baseline in IGF-1 by baseline tomato intake and randomization arm.

We observed no relationship between lycopene supple- mentation and IGF-1expression or sh oil supplement and COX -2expression in this study of men with low-risk prostate cancer. Possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy with other studies include differences in study design, population, specic doses and formulations used for the interventions, and different outcomes of interest.For example, we used 30 mg lycopene supplement, which may be less potent biologically than tomato sauce (used in Chen et al.  29). Lycopene is a fat-soluble carotenoid, and studies demonstrate that its bioactivity may be enhanced by simultaneous consumption of fat or by heat processing. This study also focused on gene expression in normalprostate tissue in men with low-burden disease. Chen et al. focused on circulating and tissue DNA oxidative damage and was conducted among men who were surgical candi-dates who may have had slightly higher risk disease  29. Additionally, our study focused on changes in the normal prostate microenvironment; it is possible that these nutri-ents may have greater effects on the tumor gene expression that were not assessed (i.e., less than one-third of biopsy samples had sufcient tumor tissue available for analysis).The 3-month intervention might also have been too short a duration to observe biologic effects in the prostate, although other studies with short nutritional interventionsin men with prostate cancer have detected gene expression changes  29,43,44 including one conducted by our col- laborative group in a similar population focused on acomprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention  9. These results do not rule out other potential important antitumor effects (e.g., antioxidant effects) of lycopene or sh oil,which are not modulated via IGF-1orCOX -2, respectively, or potential post-transcription effects on the IGF-1or COX -2pathways. The placebo used for the sh oil supplement was iso- caloric but contained olive oil, and this may have obscured our ability to detect an effect of sh oil. It is worth noting,though, that the placebo group experienced a slight down- regulation of all the genes of interest similar to the sup- plement arms, and there may be benecial effects of oliveoil versus sh oil on IGF-1-orCOX -2-related pathways that may warrant further investigation. Limitations of this clinical trial include the short-dura- tion of the intervention, examination of only single doses of lycopene and sh oil supplement, inability to assess the changes in the tumor tissue, inability to consider geneexpression differences by cell-type (e.g., stromal vs. epi- thelial), usage of only a single housekeeping gene, andrelatively small sample sizes. Strengths include the novel study design and focus on a timely important study popu- lation. The population of men who might qualify for AS regimens is growing, and it remains important to investi-gate evidence-based lifestyle recommendations for these patients. In conclusion, 3-month intervention with lycopene or sh oil supplement had no effect on normal prostate expression of IGF- 1andCOX -2(respectively) among men on AS for low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression proles assessed using genome- wide microarrays may shed further light on the bioactivityof these nutrients in prostate cancer.

        "introduction": "Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in US men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), with 192,000 newcases and 27,000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2009 1. However, the natural history of this disease is remarkably heterogeneous and not completely understood.In the United States, 90 of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when they are of localregional stage  1, and the majority of cases are indicated for biopsy by an elevatedprostate-specic antigen (PSA) level only  2.

Surgery or radiation remains the most common primary management strategies for early stage prostate cancer;however, both options are associated with decreases in urinary and sexual function  4. Active surveillance (AS) (also called delayed treatment) is becoming recognized as an alternative for many patients with early stage low- grade disease (low burden disease). AS involves closemonitoring via PSA tests, digital rectal examinations, and prostate biopsies, to delay or avoid denitive treatment and the associated comorbidities. Standard clinical interven-tions are offered at early signs of progression. Although data remain limited and randomized clinical trials are ongoing, some  3,5 but not all  6 observational reports of populations followed with AS or delayed treatment indi- cate that men experienced comparable outcomes to those with similar stage and grade disease who elected treatmentimmediately, although furthe r research with longer follow-up is needed  7. Our collaborative group established a program for men with low-burden prostate cancer who opt for AS to be offered participation in diet and lifestyle intervention research  810. Observational epidemiologic studies sug- gest that dietary factors may impact prostate cancer pro- gression. We previously reported that greater intakes of sh and tomato sauce after diagnosis of prostate cancer wereassociated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer recur- renceprogression among 1,202 prostate cancer survivors 11. Tomatoes are rich in the carotenoid lycopene, which may have antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inam- matory actions  12 and inuence the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis  1317 that has been implicated in prostate cancer  18. Fish is rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that may have anti-inammatory protective effects against prostate cancer, possibly through the inhi-bition of COX -211,1923. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that lycopene and sh oil supplements would benecially affect gene expression inputative cancer-related pathways ( IGF-1,IGF-1R, and COX -2) in normal prostate tissue of men on AS.",
        "conclusion": "Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or sh oil did not signicantly change IGF-1 andCOX -2gene expression in the normal prostate micro- environment in men with low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression proles may shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutri-ents in prostate cancer.
