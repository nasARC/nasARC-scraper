Keywords: Arabidopsis, GRF , plant, subcellular localization, 14-3-3 isoform specicity INTRODUCTION The 14-3-3s are a family of regulatory proteins that is present in all eukaryotes and involved in protein interactions mediating signaltransduction pathways. Numerous pathways and processes relyon the 14-3-3 interactions to regulate key metabolic points (e.g., Aitken et al., 1992; Ferl, 1996; Finnie et al., 1999 ;Fulgosi et al., 2002). The conservation of 14-3-3 structure among eukaryotes speaks to their essential nature, yet the divergence into so many isoforms in each of these species suggests an intricate networkof roles for these proteins (e.g., Rosenquist et al., 2000 ;Roberts and de Bruxelles, 2002 ;Sehnke et al., 2002b). Most plants have about a dozen 14-3-3 genes that provide sequence and functionaldiversity potentially leading to specialized structures and functionswithin the various members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Thatdiversity can be enlarged by selective phosphorylation of 14-3-3sat several known sites across the protein, sites that are variouslyretained among the isoforms. The purpose of this paper is to examine the evolutionary and biochemical diversity of 14-3-3s and question whether this diversity has any intrinsic biochemical,cellular, or physiological signicance; then present approaches toanswer that question. 14-3-3s are by far the major, most numerous phosphopro- tein interaction proteins in plants (e.g., Ferl, 1996, 2004; Ferl et al., 2002 ;Chevalier et al., 2009; Gokirmak et al., 2010 ;Deni- son et al., 2011 ). This fact alone puts 14-3-3s among the mostimportant interaction nodes in the Arabidopsis interactome(Braun et al., 2011 ). The 14-3-3s interact with phosphorylated peptide sequences through sequence-specic motifs RSxpSxP ,RSxxpSxP , and YpT , among others ( Aitken et al., 1992; Dubois et al., 1997a ;Y affe et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2001 ;Ferl et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2003). The phosphorylated serine or threo- nine forms both hydrogen and ionic bonds with highly conservedresidues found in the basic binding pocket of the 14-3-3 protein. In vertebrate isoform 14-3-3 , these residues are located at K49, R56, and R127 (Muslin et al., 1996 ). Binding can also occur with non-phosphorylated sequences, such as GHSL ( Andrews et al., 1998) and WLDLE (Petosa et al., 1998). These diverse binding sequences permit the 14-3-3 proteins to participate in a wide rangeof phosphorylation-based signaling pathways. Some examples inplants include red light signaling, immunity-associated cell death,abiotic stress response, A TP synthase activity in both mitochon-dria and chloroplasts, and nitrate reductase activity regulation(Ferl et al., 1994 ;Jarillo et al., 1994 ;Bunney et al., 2001; Pozuelo et al., 2001 ;Folta et al., 2008 ;Oh et al., 2010). W e consider that, in many signaling systems,14-3-3s serve to complete the phosphorylation-based, signal-induced changesin their client proteins, and that the binding of 14-3-3s nal-ize the signaling event by enabling a change in client confor-mation, activity, localization, or the association of the clientwithin a larger protein complex ( Sehnke et al., 2002a; Figure 1). www.frontiersin.org August 2012 Volume 3 Article 190 1fpls-03-00190  2012818  16:19  page2 2Paul et al. 14-3-3 Isoform functional specicity Poteng415al Eects on Client Proteins : Conformag415onal change Altered acg415vity or stability Altered localizag415on within the cell Altered interacg415ons between clientsClient Client Client Client Client Client P P PPKinases PhosphatasesATP ADPPi14-3-3 14-3-3 14-3-3 14-3-3 P? 14-3-3 14-3-3Client Client P P 14-3-3 14-3-3Client P P FIGURE 1 Function of 14-3-3s. The basic 14-3-3-mediated regulation of client activity is a two-step process whereby the target protein is rst phosphorylated by a specic kinase. This creates a recognition site for thebinding of dimeric 14-3-3 proteins, which can have a number of differenteffects on client activity. Each 14-3-3 monomer can bind to different siteson the same client protein or each can bind different client proteins. 14-3-3smay themselves be phosphorylated (as indicated by ?) although theeffects on client binding are not well understood. This consideration, that 14-3-3s should serve major phosphor- signaling roles, helps set the stage for the major hypothesis underdiscussion in this paper. With so many potential roles and many14-3-3 family members what range of specicities among familymembers might be expected with regard to biological functions of14-3-3s? 14-3-3 PRIMARY SEQUENCE EVOLUTION The 14-3-3s are considered to be a well conserved protein fam-ily, yet some areas of the proteins have undergone diversication.The number of isoforms present differs among species. Thir-teen expressed isoforms are present in Arabidopsis, seven arepresent in many animals, and two are present in yeast ( Ferl, 1996;van Heusden et al., 1996 ;DeLille et al., 2001 ;Aitken, 2006; Schoonheim et al., 2007 ;Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011 ). Amino acid identity is conserved to a reasonable degree within the entire fam-ily across species and across most of the protein ( Comparot et al., 2003; Bridges and Moorhead, 2005 ;Lottersberger et al., 2006 ; Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008 ;s e e Figure 2). Sequence alignment of the thirteen 14-3-3 proteins from Ara- bidopsis allows the visualization of regions of that have beenconserved or have diverged over evolutionary time. These regionscan also be overlain onto a structural model to help predict regionsthat may be important structurally or functionally ( Figure 3). Although there are regions that show high conservation across all isoforms, it is apparent that there are certain sub-groupings ofisoforms that show greater sequence similarity to each other. Con-servation patterns can be logical ly classied along well-supported evolutionary lineages which may imply a specialization-drivendivergence (Ferl et al., 1994 ). This potentially suggests that selec- tion pressures are present in the family due to their involvementin specialized function and complex formation ( Rosenquist et al., 2001), but this is a suggestion based on divergence branching pat-tern and not on the acquisition or loss of known functionalities.Plant 14-3-3s can be divided into two main subgroups, the and non- groups (DeLille et al., 2001 ;Sehnke et al., 2002b; Y ao et al., 2007; Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011 ). The non- group can be fur- ther subdivided, with four of these groupings occurring in thelast 170 million years (Piotrowski and Oecking, 1998; Vision et al., 2000; Rosenquist et al., 2001 ). Additionally, the group tends to have deep branching in all plant species ( Piotrowski and Oecking, 1998), suggesting that isoforms retain ancestral protein func- tion ( W ang and Shakes, 1996). The presence of multiple isoforms, however, leads to the question of functional differences. Are thesedifferent isoforms performing different cellular functions? Or dothese proteins act redundantly as backups to perform these vitalfunctions? Specicity among 14-3-3s does not appear to be associated with phylogenetic speciation. After consideration of 14-3-3 evolu-tion in plants, there emerges no compelling case for specicitythat is based on evolutionary lineages alone. There has beenno evolutionary premise that has led to the discovery of spe-cic biochemical interaction or cellular function among plant14-3-3s. There are divergences that track evolutionary change, cer-tainly, but no specic lineages have been associated with specicfunctions. 14-3-3 PHOSPHORYLATION Phosphorylation events having a physiologically relevant impacton 14-3-3s have been identied in both plants and animals undercertain conditions, but there is not yet a cohesive model for therole phosphorylation plays in dening functional specicity. How-ever, known phosphorylation sites are not universally conserved in14-3-3s, making phosphorylation an event that could mark certainisoforms for certain functionalities. A number of phosphorylation events been reported in mam- malian 14-3-3s at S58, S64, S132, S185, T233, and Y179 ( Aitken et al., 1995 ;Dubois et al., 1997a ,b;Furlanetto et al., 1997 ;Megidish et al., 1998 ;Gringhuis et al., 2005 ). Some of these sites are not con- served across all isoforms allowing potential for specic effects.

The Amino acid conservation among the 13 Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms is mapped onto the 14-3-3 protein structure (based on that of human 14-3-3 ) using ConSurf (Landau et al., 2005; Ashkenazy et al., 2010; top panel).

Furthermore,this phosphorylation event has only been detected in brain andnot in other tissues ( Aitken et al., 2002). The rst report of phosphorylation of a plant 14-3-3 protein was the demonstration that 14-3-3 can be phosphorylated in vitro (Lu et al., 1994 ). Since then, a number of large scale phospho- proteomics studies have identied plant 14-3-3 proteins in theirscreens using mass spectrometry, including gravity responses in Arabidopsis (Barjaktarovic et al., 2009) and seed development in oilseed rape ( Agrawal and Thelen, 2006). A recent study in Ara- bidopsis found evidence for phosphorylation of several isoformsat different sites at the C-terminus of the proteins. This is a regionof very low sequence conservation (Figures 2 and 3 ) providing the potential for phosphorylation to affect 14-3-3s in an isoform-specic manner (Sugiyama et al., 2008 ;Reiland et al., 2009 ). Three Arabidopsis 14-3-3s ( ,,) were identied as being phosphory- lated by SnRK2.8 in roots at S9395 ( Shin et al., 2007 ). This serine residue is conserved across only ve of the Arabidopsis isoforms.Tyrosine phosphorylation has also been reported in Maize and Arabidopsis 14-3-3s ( Olivari et al., 2000; Giacometti et al., 2004 ). Few studies have examined the functional effects of these 14-3-3modications in plants. Phosphorylation events that do have a biochemical impact on 14-3-3s have primarily been characterized in mammals. Someof these phosphorylation sites have shown to be conserved inplant 14-3-3s and may play a similar functional role ( Aitken et al., 1995; Dubois et al., 1997a ,b;Furlanetto et al., 1997 ;Megidish et al., 1998; Gringhuis et al., 2005 ). For instance, the phosphorylation of human 14-3-3 at T233 has been shown to modify the ability of 14-3-3s to interact with clients by introducing a conformationalchange of the C-terminus ( Dubois et al., 1997b ;Kubala et al., 2004 ; Obsilova et al., 2004 ;Clokie et al., 2009 ). In plants there are three sites within the C-terminal tail (helix 9) which are phosphorylatedduring seed development in Brassica ( Agrawal and Thelen, 2006) and, as mentioned above, there is also evidence for phosphory-lation at the C-terminus in Arabidopsis ( Sugiyama et al., 2008 ; Reiland et al., 2009 ). Based on the data from mammals, it can be predicted that this may affect the conformation of the C-terminusand client binding. Phosphorylat ion of human S58 affects client binding, and compromises the ability to dimerize ( Powell et al., 2003; W oodcock et al., 2003 ;G u et al., 2006 ;Jagemann et al., 2008 ; Sluchanko et al., 2011; W oodcock et al., 2010 ). S58 corresponds to residue S62 in Arabidopsis 14-3-3 . This site is conserved across all Arabidopsis isoforms with the exception of 14-3-3 and 14-3-3. In plants, phosphorylation at Y179 and S185 affects client binding,although the mechanism and their effects on 14-3-3 structure isnot known (T suruta et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2005 ;Sunayama et al., 2005; Y oshida et al., 2005 ;Barry et al., 2009). Potential tyrosine phosphorylation of the 14-3-3s at Y137 decreases binding to theH-A TPase (Olivari et al., 2000; Giacometti et al., 2004 ). Although the Y179 and Y137 sites are conserved across all isoforms, S185 isnot present in 14-3-3 . Since phosphorylation sites are not conserved across all isoforms, differential phosphorylation could lead to increasedfunctional specicity within 14-3-3s ( Moreira et al., 2008). This leads to a situation where discussion of 14-3-3s must accommo-date and acknowledge not only the primary sequence differenceamong 14-3-3s but also the differential phosphorylation among14-3-3s (see Figure 4). 14-3-3 DIMERIZATION The 14-3-3 isoforms are present in cells as some combinationof homodimers or heterodimers. Dimer formation in 14-3-3sinvolves interactions within residues of the rst four alpha helices(Gardino et al., 2006 ). In any cell containing multiple isoforms, if all isoforms could dimerize freely with each other, this wouldallow for many different combinations. It has been argued that thiscould dilute out any functional differences between or among iso-forms ( Wilker et al., 2005).

This potential is provided by the fact thathelices 1 through 4 do contain some of the areas of higher sequencevariation among isoforms. It has been suggested that homodimers and heterodimers could have different functions ( Aitken, 2002 ). In mammalian systems, studies have shown that two isoforms in particular, 14-3-3and 14-3-3, show a preference to form either homodimers orheterodimers. In one study, immunoprecipitation of endoge-nous 14-3-3 from a human cancer cell line showed that it was present primarily as homodimers whereas 14-3-3 formed het- erodimers to a much greater extent ( Wilker et al., 2005). It is thought that this preference of 14-3-3 to homodimerize allows it to bind isoform-specic clients and play a specic role inthe DNA damage checkpoint that is not shared with other iso-forms ( Wilker et al., 2005). Conversely, 14-3-3 has been detected only as heterodimers when expressed in vivo (Chaudhri et al., 2003; Y ang et al., 2006 ). Studies of the crystal structure of the mammalian isoforms have helped to explain why this prefer-ence for homodimers or heterodimers may exist. There are anumber of variable amino acids in the dimer interface betweenisoforms. Subsequently, the number of stabilizing salt bridgesin the dimer interface varies between one and three dependingon the isoform. In the case of the 14-3-3 homodimer, there are three salt bridges and also extra interactions between aro-matic ring side chains, stabilizing the homodimers (Benzingeret al., 2005 ;Wilker et al., 2005; Gardino et al., 2006 ;Y ang et al., 2006). If 14-3-3 was to form a homodimers, there would only be one stabilizing salt bridge and therefore may be the reasonwhyprefers to form heterodimers ( Gardino et al., 2006 ;Y ang et al., 2006 ). The two yeast 14-3-3s also show an inclination to form heterodimers rather than homodimers ( Chaudhri et al., 2003). There is also evidence for preferences for particular het-erodimer partners in mammals. Specicity was shown in thedimer partners co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged 14-3-3  or 14-3-3 expressed in neuronal cells which did not appear due to the amount of total endogenous isoform present ( Chaudhri et al., 2003 ). In plant systems, the issues surrounding dimerization are even less resolved, particularly in vivo . Our early studies look- ing at the in vitro dimerization potential of different recombinant Arabidopsis 14-3-3s hinted that there may be some differences between isoforms in their preferences for dimer partners. In thatstudy, although all four Arabidopsis isoforms tested were able toform all combinations of both homodimers and heterodimers inyeast-2-hybrid, there were interesting results when different iso-form pairs were renatured in vitro and analyzed by native gels, which suggested there are differences in the ratios of homod-imers to heterodimers present between different isoform pairs(Wu et al., 1997 ). In another Arabidopsis study, TAP tagged 14-3-3 expressed in cell suspension cells was detected as both homodimers as well as heterodimers with nine other isoformssuggesting that in cells this isoform is able to form dimer partnerswith multiple isoforms ( Chang et al., 2009 ). In contrast, in a yeast two-hybrid study with cotton 14-3-3s, none of the six isoformswere able to form homodimers, yet heterodimers were detected.Selectivity was also shown in the particular heterodimer partnersof the isoforms ( Zhang et al., 2010 ). Dimerization between different 14-3-3s is, therefore, likely to be variable and depend at least on the intrinsic afnitiesamong 14-3-3s isoforms. Further, dimerization is likely to bevariable within cell types, depending on the expression levelsand sub-cellular localization of different isoforms, in additionto the phosphorylation status of isoforms. As mentioned above,phosphorylation of 14-3-3s can inhibit dimerization ( W oodcock et al., 2003 ;G u et al., 2006 ). There is evidence in mammals that monomeric 14-3-3s may be functional too and may have dif-ferent client binding properties to the dimers ( Shen et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2003 ;Han et al., 2010). This leads to the conclusion that dimerization status, particularly the degree of heterodimer-ization, must be accounted for in any model of 14-3-3 isoformspecicity. STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE Given the clear presence of diversity in the primary structure of14-3-3s in plants, and further given that this primary sequencediversity can be amplied by phosphorylation and by heterodimer-ization, what are the biochemical, cellular, and physiologicalimpacts of that diversity? Is the diversity an evolutionary collec-tion of biochemically irrelevant genetic drift or is the diversity areection of true functional specication within the 14-3-3 fam-ily? With multiple isoforms present in any cell, the potential fordilution through dimerization, and with the common theme ofinteraction with certain phosphorylated peptides, it is difcult toconstruct obvious modes of isoform functional specicity. Our theory, however, is that true cellular and biochemical func- tional specicity does indeed exist among members of the 14-3-3family. Disproving specicity as a hypothesis would be difcult, aslack of data cannot constitute proof of the hypothesis as being false.Therefore, our formally stated null hypothesis would be that no functional specicity exists among 14-3-3s. Rejection of this nullhypothesis would be accomplished by any clear observations ofspecic function between or among 14-3-3 isoforms, which wouldthen support our broader theory of specicity among 14-3-3s. Ingeneral, we posit that certain 14-3-3s in a given cellular context and only those 14-3-3s  will have specic interactions that are notshared with other 14-3-3s, and as a result, certain 14-3-3s will havefunctional phenotypes revealed by mutation. Data are emergingfrom the literature in support of this notion. As a particular out-come for developing tests of the hypothesis, we posit that multiple14-3-3s may be present in equal concentrations within a cell, yeteach may biochemically interact with different clients and eachmay therefore have different cellular functions and localizations.Data from the literature and some primary data are presentedin support of this notion. Full consideration of all factors sug-gests that it is possible that restricted groups of isoforms mayhave interactions and functions that are shared within that group.Members of a certain evolutionary branch would be one exampleof a group with potential shared specicities. 14-3-3s phospho-rylated at a certain residue might also constitute a functionallyspecic group. And it is also possible that some biochemicaland cellular functions could be shared by all isoforms. But themain idea of the theory is that out of the family of conserved, www.frontiersin.org August 2012 Volume 3 Article 190 5fpls-03-00190  2012818  16:19  page6 6Paul et al. 14-3-3 Isoform functional specicity dimerizing 14-3-3s within a plant cell, certain isoforms or iso- form groups do have certain specic biochemical interactions andfunctions. ELEMENTS OF THE ISSUE In order to address the theory and set up observational tests ofthe null hypothesis, we present data of functional redundancy that would fail to reject the null hypothesis, and also present obser- vations of specicity that appear to reject the null hypothesis, thereby supporting the theory of specicity. Note that the theoryof specicity does not explicitly deal with cell-specic expres-sion of 14-3-3s, though this is an important overall componentof 14-3-3 roles. It is certainly possible that developmental speci-city of expression could present certain 14-3-3s with prominentroles in certain tissues, regardless of the specicity at the cellularor biochemical level. W e therefore discuss briey just how muchtissue-specic expression of 14-3-3s might exist, then we examineredundancy and specicity at the cellular and biochemical lev-els as these levels do address directly the questions of functionalspecicity among protein isoforms. EXPRESSION SPECIFICITY In mammals, early 14-3-3 literature reported differences in the dis-tribution of isoform transcripts in different regions of the brainby in situ hybridization, and also in other mammalian tissuesby northern blot analysis ( W atanabe et al., 1993 ,1994). The dif- ference in expression between brain structures is also supportedby data from microarray studies in mice which show14-3-3 to have by far the highest expression of any isoform in hippocampus.Conversely, the hypothalamus shows very low 14-3-3 expression compared to the other isoforms, with 14-3-3 showing the highest expression levels followed by 14-3-3  (Rangel et al., 2009 ;Kim, 2012; Nijnik et al., 2012 ;W efers et al., 2012 ). 14-3-3 in particu- lar shows notable differences in tissue expression compared to theother isoforms as it has only been detected in epithelial cells ( Lef- fers et al., 1993 ). 14-3-3 has received signicant attention due to its proposed role as a tumor suppressor and thought to be linkedto the exit of cells from the stem cell compartment of epithe-lia to become differentiated ( Hermeking, 2003). As described in the dimerization section above, this specialized role may bedue to its unique structural characteristics, not shared with otherisoforms. In plants, early reports showed that Arabidopsis 14-3-3 is differentially expressed in tissues by analysis of promoter activityand in situ hybridization (Daugherty et al., 1996). 14-3-3 shows relatively high expression in owers compared to leaves and stemsby semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis, in contrast to 14-3-3 and 14-3-3 which show fairly even expression across these tissues (Sorrell et al., 2003). One isoform in particular, 14-3-3 , shows a distribution more restricted to owers hinting that it may play aspecialized role here ( Rosenquist et al., 2001 ). This is supported by microarray data from a number of studies which shows the13 isoforms show a fairly similar expression pattern across tissues(Dinneny et al., 2008 ;Grifths et al., 2011 ), with the exception of 14-3-3 where transcripts are almost completely restricted to closed ower buds ( Hennig et al., 2004 ;Figure 5). It should be noted that in situ hybridization and promoter fusion studies givean impression of greater cell specicity than observed by large scalemicroarray studies of tissues or organs. Rice 14-3-3 isoforms shows differences in expression across tis- sues and this pattern is different between isoforms ( Chen et al., 2006; Y ao et al., 2007; Purwestri et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, in one study the Os14-3-3-C isoform, which showed the most evenlyhigh expression across all tissues studied, was also the most suc-cessful isoform in complementing deletion mutants of the 14-3-3homologues in yeast (see below). This led the authors to spec-ulate that isoforms such as Os14-3-3-C, which show ubiquitousexpression across all tissues, may play very general and fundamen-tal roles in rice. On the other hand, isoforms like Os14-3-3-G,which are unable to rescue the yeast 14-3-3 knockout, and whichshows a more restricted tissue distribution, may play unique rolesin response to specic conditions or developmental stages ( Ya o et al., 2007 ). A similar variation in tissue distribution between isoforms exists in cotton ( Shi et al., 2007 ), soybean ( Zhang et al., 2010; Li and Dhaubhadel, 2011 ), and broad bean ( Emi et al., 2001 ). Vf14-3-3a shows higher expression in guard cells compared to the three other isoforms. It was proposed therefore that Vf14- 3-3a may have a higher afnity for binding to the H-A TPase than Vf14-3-3b, another isoform that is expressed in guard cells(Emi et al., 2001 ). EVIDENCE FOR REDUNDANCY Redundancy in 14-3-3 function can be examined from several per-spectives. One perspective is physiological and can be approachedby experiments with genetic mutations or TDNA knockoutsin plants. The other perspective is biochemical, which can beexamined by assays of direct biochemical interaction in vitro. Physiological redundancy One key observation in support of redundancy would be thelack of observable phenotype in a 14-3-3 TDNA knockout. In Arabidopsis, early studies indicated that several different 14-3- 3 TDNA insertion mutants had no observable phenotype at all.Further, several combinations of 14-3-3 TDNA insertions appar-ently had no observable phenotype ( Krysan et al., 1996 ,1999), allowing for the continued debate over the extent of 14-3-3 func-tional redundancy in plants ( Comparot et al., 2003 ;Ferl, 2004; Chevalier et al., 2009). There are also examples of different isoforms being involved with the same physiological response. Several 14-3-3s are involvedin drought-related processes, and specic 14-3-3 isoforms havebeen implicated at the protein level in drought-stress, where over-expression of different single isoforms, At14-3-3 or ZmGF14-6, can enhance drought tolerance ( Y an et al., 2004; Campo et al., 2012). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a knockout of one of the two 14-3-3 forms results in a viable line, while thedouble knockout is lethal, suggesting the two isoforms foundin yeast are functionally redundant ( Lottersberger et al., 2006, 2007; Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008 ). This simple observation strongly suggests that the yeast 14-3-3s are essentially redundant,even though the single mutants do exhibit some growth differ-entials. The yeast double 14-3-3 mutant can be rescued by four Arabidopsis isoforms (van Heusden et al., 1996 ;Sorrell et al., 2003) and a human isoform ( Zannis-Hadjopoulos et al., 2008 ).

However, recent resultssuggest that this conclusion is not universal. The Os14-3-3-C iso-form is much more successful in complementing yeast deletionmutant than Os14-3-3-G ( Y ao et al., 2007). While there may be basic or fundamental activities in yeast that can be supported bymany isoforms from plants, it may not be universally true that allplant isoforms can complement yeast.Biochemical redundancy At the biochemical level there is evidence that 14-3-3 isoforms have overlapping client binding proles. Multiple mammalian iso-forms show a very similar sequence binding preference based onscreens across peptide libraries ( Y affe et al., 1997; Muslin et al., 1996). Six mammalian isoforms can all bind Bad in vitro and are able to reduce the apoptotic effects of Bad on cells ( Subrama- nian et al., 2001 ). In plants studies, three different Arabidopsis isoforms were able to activate the H-A TPase ( Baunsgaard et al., www.frontiersin.org August 2012 Volume 3 Article 190 7fpls-03-00190  2012818  16:19  page8 8Paul et al. 14-3-3 Isoform functional specicity 1998) and surface plasmon resonance has shown that three barley isoforms can bind a lipoxygenase enzyme with similar afnities(Holtman et al., 2000 ). While not exhaustive in their treatments across isoforms, these studies and other studies indicate that at thebiochemical interaction level, there can be overlap and similarityamong isoforms with regard to client afnities. EVIDENCE FOR FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY AMONG ISOFORMS Although data supporting 14-3-3 functional specicity in plants are few, any observed specicity for any 14-3-3 function would reject the formal null hypothesis of complete isoform redundancy.From the literature there are now several cases of individual 14-3-3 TDNA insertions conditioning an observable phenotype. Thefact that any phenotype can be assigned to 14-3-3s argues forspecicity from rst principles. Given the wide distribution of14-3-3 isoform expression ( Figure 5) it is likely that most cells have 14-3-3s present in addition to the one that is knocked out,hence phenotypes for individual 14-3-3s argues for specicity atthe cellular level. Moreover, there are also now a few comparativestudies in which phenotypes are known to be conditioned by one14-3-3 isoform but not another. Functional specicity revealed by TDNA mutations Functional diversity of plant 14-3-3s is widely documented, andincludes primary metabolism, abiotic and biotic stress, light-mediated processes, hormonal signaling, and basic cell growth anddivision (reviewed in Aitken, 2002; Denison et al., 2011). How- ever, discrete examples of isoform functional specicity revealedby individual TDNA mutations are now emerging. The Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms andare involved in light sensing and signaling (Mayeld et al., 2007). Mutant and plants ower later and exhibit long hypocotyls under red light, withlittle effect under blue or far-red light. The long hypocotyl pheno-type is consistent with a role for 14-3-3 andin phytochrome B signaling. Y east two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assaysindicate that 14-3-3 andproteins physically interact with CONSTANS, a central regulator of the photoperiod pathway.T ogether, these data indicate a potential role for these specic14-3-3 isoforms in affecting photoperiodic owering via inter-action with CONSTANS, possibly as integrators of light signalssensed through the phytochrome system. These observations setat least 14-3-3 and 14-3-3 apart as 14-3-3s individually capable of regulating of owering time. However, even though both 14-3-3 andaffect owering time, they are not themselves redundant with each other. In therst place, redundancy between 14-3-3 andwould preclude either one from having a owering phenotype as an individualTDNA mutation. In addition, 14-3-3 TDNA insertion mutants have a distinctive short root phenotype, a phenotype that is notpresent in 14-3-3 TDNA insertions ( Mayeld et al., 2012). This observation suggests that functional specicity is likely contextdependent. In a demonstration of remarkable specicity that is likely dependent on cellular context, the Arabidopsis andisoforms differentially affect Phot2 signaling in guard cells. andare closely related isoforms on a well-supported, separate evolution-ary branch within the non- group. anddiffer by only a fewamino acids in primary sequence, yet is required for normal stomatal opening by Phot2 while insertion mutations have no effect ( T seng et al., 2012). This observation suggests that in certain very specialized cell types, in this case the guard cells of the stom-ata, very specic requirements for certain specic 14-3-3 do exist(see also below). Biochemical specicity Plants have shown variation among isoforms in their afnity forspecic client proteins. In Arabidopsis, recombinant constructs of14-3-3 ,,,, andwere comparatively tested for their ability to interact with phosphorylated nitrate reductase from spinachleaves, demonstrating drastically different levels of interaction(Bachmann et al., 1996). Different levels of biochemical inhibitionof nitrate reductase have also been shown ( Lambeck et al., 2010, 2012). Recombinant 14-3-3s have different afnities for H-A TPase(Rosenquist et al., 2000 ) and those afnities are not in the same relative order as described for nitrate reductase interactions. Inaddition, yeast two-hybrid studies in barley show differences ininteraction levels for clients ( Bornke, 2005; Schoonheim et al., 2007) and barley isoforms differ in their ability to inhibit NR orregulate K channels (Sinnige et al., 2005a, b). Six cotton 14-3-3s showed specicity in target binding in yeast two-hybrid study(Zhang et al., 2010 ). These studies do not necessarily stand in contrast to those studies cited above in which biochemical redun-dancy was demonstrated. T aken together, it is likely that thereis a range of biochemical interaction afnities among isoforms,with isoforms demonstrating similar afnities for certain peptidesor protein clients while also dem onstrating specic afnities for some peptides and protein clients. Subcellular localization as a measure of specicity Subcellular localization can be a powerful indicator of 14-3-3specicity among isoforms. The localization of a given 14-3-3could be viewed as being directed by two forces. One force is theintrinsic localization of the individual 14-3-3 itself due to signalspresent in the 14-3-3 sequence. 14-3-3s are known, for exam-ple, to contain a Nuclear Export Signal (NES), and that signal isthought to aid in the 14-3-3-mediated movement of transcriptionfactors out of the nucleus ( Graves et al., 2001 ;Brunet et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2004 ;Nishino et al., 2008 ). The other force inuenc- ing 14-3-3 localization would be the location of the client protein.Localization of the 14-3-3client complex would be dependentupon not only the localization signals of the 14-3-3 but also onthe localization signal of the client protein. If the 14-3-3 NESwas the dominant localization force, 14-3-3s would be expectedto be prominently cytosolic in their localization. T o expandthis discussion we consider two possible 14-3-3 localizationnotions. At one level, consider the number of potential interactions for a single given isoform. That isoform would have only oneset of intrinsic signals, an intrinsic localization based on its ownstructure. The other forces determining localization of the 14-3-3would be derived from its interacting client protein. Most esti-mates of potential 14-3-3 interacting proteins in any cell, basedon the presence of the canonical 14-3-3 recognition sequences,range from hundreds to thousands (Sehnke et al., 2002a). If these Frontiers in Plant Science Plant Proteomics August 2012 Volume 3 Article 190 8fpls-03-00190  2012818  16:19  page9 9Paul et al. 14-3-3 Isoform functional specicity interacting proteins actually occur and are distributed randomly among cell compartments (nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma mem-brane, for example), the given 14-3-3 isoform should be broadlydispersed among cellular locatio ns because of the many locations of its clients. Under such conditions of promiscuous client interac-tion, a specic subcellular localization of any given 14-3-3 wouldbe very unlikely. However, there certainly are distinct 14-3-3 sub-cellular localizations that are tissue-specic and different among14-3-3 isoforms in plants (Sehnke et al., 2002a; Maraschin et al., 2003; Paul et al., 2005 ;Campo et al., 2012). Further, disrupting the client interactions can inuence the localization of specic14-3-3s (Paul et al., 2005 ;Sabina et al., 2007 ). Thus any observ- able, limited, specic subcellular localization of a 14-3-3 supportsthe notion that the 14-3-3 is interacting with a specic subset ofcellular proteins (see Figure 6). At a second level, consider the potential interactions of two dif- ferent 14-3-3 isoforms present in the same cell. If the two isoformswere interacting with the same clients, the two isoforms would bepresent in the same subcellular locales. However, isoform-specicimmunocytochemistry demonstrates that individual 14-3-3s canand do partition themselves in different locations within the cell.Figure 6 illustrates the localization of 14-3-3 and 14-3-3 in a young Arabidopsis root. Both andare robustly expressed in roots (see Figure 5). Y et the localization patterns for andare distinctly different across the cells of the root tip ( Figure 6A). In the central cells marked with the C box in Figure 6, is largely nuclear, while is largely associated with the plasma membrane or cell wall. This single observation has dramatic implicationsfor the notion of isoform-specic functionality. Because and are in two separate and distinct locations, they cannot be exten-sively heterodimerizing with each other. If expressed equally andrandomly dimerizing, andwould be present in a ratio of 1:2:1 of homodimers:  heterdomers: homodimers. There- fore, two-third of the red and green signals would be combinedinto a yellow heterodimer signal. This is clearly not the case. Infact the majority of signal in these cells is distinctly green or red.Because andare in separate subcellular locales, they cannot be interacting with the same clients or subsets of clients unless theintrinsic localization signals of the 14-3-3s are distinct and directthe localization of the complex. Moreover, the fact of specicand limited localization of these isoforms suggests that in thesecells,andare interacting with few, potentially unique, client proteins. In the root tip cells marked with the B box in Figure 6, and are almost evenly distributed with regard to subcellular localiza- tion. In these cells they could be heterodimerizing or they couldbe interacting with a large number of different clients individu-ally. Regardless, this distribution suggests that at least these twoisoforms have distinct roles in metabolic processes in the differentroot zones, and further, that those roles can change depending onspecic cell function. Other specialized cell types exhibit isoform-specic distribu- tions as well. Subcellular localization of specic 14-3-3s was alsoexamined in plants transformed with GFP fusions of individual14-3-3 isoforms. Subcellular differences among the GFP fusionlines were most apparent in specialized cell types, such as tri-chomes and guard cells ( Paul et al., 2005 ). The guard cells provide aparticularly striking example. 14-3-3 -GFP is distributed through- out the cytoplasm, but diminished in the nucleus (Figure 6D).On the other hand, 14-3-3 -GFP is almost exclusively nuclear (Figur e 6E). 14-3-3-GFP is generally expressed at lower lev-els, but when it is found in guard cells, it is always localized tothe edges that dene the stomata ( Figure 6F). This marked dif- ference in the distribution of andwas surprising given the similarity of the two isoforms, however, distinct functional rolesfor these two related isoforms has also been demonstrated withrespect to Phot2-mediated processes, where it was shown that  played a role in stomatal opening in response to blue light, butdid not (T seng et al., 2012). The distribution of 14-3-3 -GFP is seen throughout the cell and nucleus, but is especially promi-nent along the cytoskeleton ( Figure 6G). In fact, live imaging with confocal microscopy shows the GFP-tagged isoform mov- ing rapidly along the bers of the matrix, to and from the nucleus(Paul et al., 2005 ). MODEL AND THEORY FOR SPECIFICITY Data strongly support the theory of specicity in 14-3-3 functionalinteractions at the cellular level. T wo major types of observationscleanly reject the null hypothesis that no specicity exists and thatall 14-3-3s are functionally redundant; the presence of phenotypesfor 14-3-3 insertion mutants and the differential subcellular local-ization of isoforms within a cell. Given the wide expression prolesof most plant 14-3-3 genes, it is likely that almost every cell in theplant has a fairly complex population of different 14-3-3 isoformsand that many cells contain many 14-3-3 isoforms. Therefore,the existence of phenotype(s) associated with individual 14-3-3insertion mutations is strong evidence that the particular isoformplays an important role that is not entirely complemented by other14-3-3s present in a cell. Earlier, general studies showing thatsome 14-3-3 insertion mutations displayed no phenotype are nowbeing supplanted by specic studies of well characterized insertionmutations that do display phenotypes. Furthermore, cell biologyobservations dene another element of specicity. Within a par-ticular cell, different 14-3-3s can be found in distinct subcellularlocations, demonstrating clearly that the different 14-3-3s cannotbe interacting with all of the same clients and serving the samecellular function. Among many, the example of 14-3-3 and 14- 3-3 is quite compelling and complete. These isoforms are closely related yet show differential localization and differential physio-logical function within the light signaling pathways of guard cells(Paul et al., 2005 ;T seng et al., 2012). The statement that there can be specicity in 14-3-3 func- tion within a cell is, however, a simplication of a larger andmore complex model for 14-3-3 interactions and functions. Afull model for 14-3-3s interactions must incorporate a quan-titative appreciation for (1) the number of different 14-3-3spresent in the cell of interest, (2) the concentrations of eachisoform, (3) the heterodimerization afnity among the isoformspresent, (4) the afnities for each of the isoforms for eachclient target protein in the cell, and (5) any modications ofthe 14-3-3s. Given these complexities, it is perhaps remarkablethat specicity does exist in 14-3-3 function. Redundancies infunction also exist. Therefore, a complete model of 14-3-3 rolesmust also accommodate some pool of overlapping specicities www.frontiersin.org August 2012 Volume 3 Article 190 9fpls-03-00190  2012818  16:19  page 10  10Paul et al. 14-3-3 Isoform functional specicity FIGURE 6 Distinctly different 14-3-3 localizations determined by confocal microscopy of Arabidopsis. Isoform-specic antibodies that have been directly labeled with either Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 and used for in situ labeling. 14-3-3 (green) predominates in the nucleus while 14-3-3 (red) predominates in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. A single longitudinal optical slice of a root tip is shown in (A). (B,C) Provide closer views of theboxed sections of the root in (A). The root tip (B)exhibits an even distribution of 14-3-3- and 14-3-3- throughout the cells, and a section father back in the root (C)exhibits a clear partitioning of 14-3-3- into the nucleus and 14-3-3-  to the plasma membranecell wall. Guard cell subcellular localization of fourGFP-tagged 14-3-3 isomers is shown in the bottom row: (D),(E),(F), and(G). and perhaps some completely redundant functions among isoforms. The 14-3-3 family of isoforms, dimers, and modied forms should be considered a complex and dynamic system, a systemthat should be addressed and better understood with each exper-iment. This will require comparative studies. Where possible,observations about a given 14-3-3 isoform should be comparedand contrasted with other isoforms within the same experiment.This is a key element often missing in current 14-3-3 literature. With increasing TDNA mutations publically available, for exam- ple, contrasts in experiments should accompany statements of14-3-3 roles, including data where no phenotype is observed in Frontiers in Plant Science Plant Proteomics August 2012 Volume 3 Article 190 10fpls-03-00190  2012818  16:19  page 1 1  1 1Paul et al. 14-3-3 Isoform functional specicity some mutation(s). Care should be taken to be specic in the description of isoforms in an experiment and conclusions drawnfrom one isoform should not be considered to be true for otherisoforms until tested. The limits of reagents and databases shouldbe taken into consideration. For example, the Affymetrix arraydoes not list a probeset for 14-3-3 , and the probeset for 14-3- 3 very likely hybridizes with both 14-3-3 and, presenting a likely over estimate of 14-3-3 expression. Similarly, proteomics peptide databases do not always properly distinguish among iso-forms, and peptides can be identied being from a particularisoform when in fact that peptide can be from all membersof an evolutionary group. And TDNA insertions can result invarious levels of 14-3-3 expression at the protein level. Deeperunderstanding of the 14-3-3 families and their roles as individualisoforms will therefore require experiments that are comparativeamong isoforms and a rened approach that increases the ability toidentify individual isoforms and isoform groups as experimentalcontrasts. The theory of 14-3-3 specicity p redicts that, when properly monitored and experimentally contrasted, certain 14-3-3 isoformshave a function that is not present in other isoforms  even if thatisoform is present in the same cell. This theory does not precludethat there will be examples of overlapping function, but it doesstate that some functions will be clearly distinct among isoforms.Other systems of isoform families have embraced this notion. Forinstance, mammalian Akt protein kinases are highly conservedand function in the regulation of a diversity of cellular functions.Y et phenotypic studies with knockout mice have demonstrated that the three isoforms that comprise this family play distinctroles in the regulation of cellular growth, glucose homeosta-sis, and neuronal development. This reverse genetics approachestablishes that the functions of each Akt isoform do not whollyoverlap, and demonstrates that isoform-specic signaling con-tributes to the diversity of Akt activities in mice ( Gonzalez and McGraw, 2009). In Drosophila, the demonstration that lines de- cient in one or the other of their two 14-3-3 genes were notfully functional lead to the discovery that D14-3-3 plays a spe- cic role in pole cell migration, a specic function that couldnot be rescued by 14-3-3 Leo ( T sigkari et al., 2012). Thus it is apparent that specicity in isoform families can be discov-ered and appreciated within an enabled and aware experimentalcontext.
