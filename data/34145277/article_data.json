Iwaniec1,2and Russell T. Turner1,2 Sixteen-week-old female C57BL6J mice were sacri ced aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of ight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Space ight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and -oxidation. npj Microgravity (2021) 7:23 ; https:doi.org10.1038s41526-021-00150-y Mice are facultative daily heterotherms and, in contrast to humans who maintain a near constant core body temperature over a wide range of environmental temperatures, mice can experiencedramatic transient reductions in core temperature (torpor) whenexposed to temperatures below thermoneutral 1,2. Because of their small mass, mice are much more dependent on shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis for maintaining core body tempera-ture than larger animals3. The recommended temperature for housing mice in a laboratory setting (20 26 C) is well below their thermoneutral zone, which depending upon strain, sex and age typically rangesfrom 29 31 C4. Subthermoneutral housing induces adaptive responses in mice to increase generation of heat5. These adaptations include shivering thermogenesis, non-shivering ther-mogenesis, thermic effect of increased food consumption and physical activity. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurotrans- mitters (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and the adipokineleptin are key factors involved in regulation of adaptivethermogenesis 6,7. Subthermoneutral-housed mice use a variety of physiological and behavioral strategies to decrease their requirements for adaptive thermogenesis. These include enteringtorpor to lower core body temperature, and nest building, huddling and postural changes to minimize heat loss when exposed to a cool environment8,9. The physiological demands required for successful adaptation to subthermoneutral housing by mice are considerable; forexample, female mice housed at room temperature (22 C) consumed 40 more food to achieve comparable weight gainand expressed 5-fold higher Ucp1 gene expression in BAT (non- shivering thermogenesis) compared to thermoneutral-housed (32 C) mice 10. UCP-1 protein uncouples oxidative phosphorylation to produce heat instead of ATP. Extensive research supports theconclusion that by increasing UCP-1 protein levels, sympathetic signaling-driven non-shivering thermogenesis plays an important role in cold-induced thermoregulation in mice. We hypothesize that space ight reduces the ability of mice to employ some of the strategies used to minimize adaptivethermogenesis, such as huddling and postural adjustments, resulting in an increased dependence on adaptive thermogenesisto maintain core body temperature. Group housing attenuates the increase in non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT in mice exposedto a cool environment 11but it is plausible that another aspect of the space ight environment increases sympathetic signaling, an important positive regulator of thermogenesis. Whatever theprecise mechanism, increased thermogenesis is importantbecause it in uences multiple physiological processes 1215. Collateral changes associated with increased thermogenesis include cancellous bone loss, immune suppression, increases inglucocorticoid production, increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and altered tumor and tissue response to ionizing radiation1618. Mechanistically, at least some of these responses are mediated by increased sympathetic out ow14,19,20. Thus, activation of adaptive thermogenesis in mice housed in microgravity may introduce unrecognized and uncontrolled for confounding variables into space ight studies. We tested the hypothesis that nonshivering thermogenesis is increased in mice during space ight by measuring the effect of space ight on expression of genes related to energy metabolism in BAT andWAT in female C57BL6J (B6) mice. In contrast to most priorspace ight studies where ight animals were returned to Earth, the animals in this experiment (RR-1) were sacri ced aboard the International Space Station (ISS), avoiding the in uence of restoration of normal gravitational loading. Temperatures during the space ight mission ranged from a low of 21.3 C to a high of 28.0 C. The average housing temperatures within the Habitats enclosing the mice aboard ISS were 26.0 Cand 26.4 C for ight and ground control animals, respectively. These housing temperatures, while above temperatures com- monly used to house mice, are below thermoneutral for thisspecies. Weight gain did not differ, but activity levels were higher in the ight animals, as was food and water depletion 21,ndings consistent with increased adaptive thermogenesis. The effect of the space ight environment on differential expression of genes related to energy metabolism in BAT in ight animals is shown in Table 1. Transcript abundance of 1384 genes were signi cantly altered in ight animals compared to ground controls. In particular, mice housed aboard ISS had 1.5x higherlevels of Ucp-1 in BAT, providing direct evidence for elevated non- shivering thermogenesis. Several genes associated with adipogen- esis andor thermogenesis, including Adipoq ,Ppargc1a, Cdkn1a22, and Cfdwere differentially expressed in BAT during space ight23. However, these changes may re ect adaptation to long duration 1Skeletal Biology Laboratory, School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.2Center for Healthy Aging Research, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.email: russell.turneroregonstate.eduwww.nature.comnpjmgrav Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA1234567890():,;Table 1.

Regardless of the mechanisms for initiation, increased Ucp1 -mediated thermogenesis in BAT may have had a major impact on adipose tissue turnover in WAT (Table 2). Transcript abundance of 3084 genes were signi cantly altered in ight animals compared to ground controls. Notable changes, includinghigher expression levels for (1) Acacb (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase), a key gene in regulation of fatty acid oxidation, (2) Dio2 (Type II iodothyronine deiodinase), a key regulator of thyroid hormoneaction, (3) Sic2a4 (Glut 4), an insulin-regulated glucose transporter, and (4) Fasn (fatty acid synthase) which catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate, were observed in WAT of ight animals. There was also evidence for induction of Ucp-1 ; expression level for this gene was very low (Ct  30) in ground control mice and consistentlydetected in ight mice (Ct  30), suggesting browning of WAT 24. We conclude from these ndings that, in spite of comparable housing temperatures, adaptive thermogenesis is increased in BATof mice housed aboard the ISS compared to ground controls. This is important because increased thermogenesis may exaggerate (e.g., bone loss) or alter (e.g., response to ionizing radiation)physiological responses to space ight in mice. Because of species speci c differences in thermoregulation, this could impact the translatability of the animal studies to astronauts. METHODS Space ight study Details of the space ight mission are published25. Animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee prior to the conduct of experiments. In brief, 16-week-oldfemale B6 mice were sacri ced aboard the ISS after 37 days of ight and frozen carcasses were returned to Earth for tissue preparation and method validation as described 21. Sensors in the Habitats ( ight and ground) monitored and relayed information including component temperature andhumidity. The data were logged at sampling rate of 1 Hz. Ground controlmice were sacri ced and processed using the same timelines and protocols as the ight animals. Gene expression study RNA was isolated from individual BAT ( n8group) and WAT ( n6 group) samples. RNA integrity number (RIN) was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA). A RIN value of 5 and above is required to ensure reliable quanti cation of gene expression by RT-qPCR26,27. The RIN numbers (mean  SE, n6group) for RNA isolated from BAT from ight and ground control animals were 6.55  0.47, and 7.42  0.46, respectively. Thus RNA from both groups of animals were of good quality.mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (ThermoFisher Scienti c). Expression levels for genes related to adipogenesis was determined for BAT and WAT usingthe Mouse Adipogenesis RT 2Proler PCR Array (Qiagen). Gene expression was normalized using GusB and ActB housekeeping genes, and relativequanti cation ( Ct method) was determined using RT2Proler PCR Array Data Analysis software (Qiagen).
