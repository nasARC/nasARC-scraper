KEYWORDS Fusarium , International Space Station, fungi, genomics Fusarium oxysporum isapresumedasexual,lamentousfungusubiquitousinsoiland infamous for causing vascular wilt and root rot disease in many economically important plants and crops ( 1). While the number of hosts this species can infect is extensive (tomatoes, bananas, cotton, strawberries, eggplants, tulips, soybean, beets, andchrysanthemum, to name only a few) ( 2), individual isolates show a high degree of host specicityandareassignedto formae speciales (f.sp.)basedonthehostitcaninfect( 3).For example, F. oxysporum f.sp. cubensecausesfungalwiltinbananas(Panamadisease)while f.sp. melonis,f.sp. tulipae,andf.sp. cucumerimum infectandcausediseaseinmelons,tulips, and cucumbers, respectively. At present, there are approximately 150 formae speciales (i.e., host-specic groups of strains) that have been described ( 2). While well known as a phytopathogen, F. oxysporum can also cause infections in humans, ranging from supercial and localized (skin, nail, cornea, and supercialwound) in immunocompetent individuals to invasive and disseminated (blood culture,Citation Urbaniak C, van Dam P, Zaborin A, Zaborina O, Gilbert JA, Torok T, Wang CCC,Venkateswaran K. 2019.

Since members of the fungal genus Fusarium are intrinsically resistant to most available antifungals on the market ( 7), prognosis is often poor and sometimes fatal for those aficted with systemic fusariosis ( 6,8). Fungi are known to produce many bioactive molecules that can benet humans, such as antimicrobials, antialgals, immunosuppressants, compounds cytotoxic to can-cer cells, insecticides, and antioxidants ( 911), and F. oxysporum is no exception. F. oxysporum isolated from the plants Smallanthus sonchifolius and Catharanthus roseus were shown to produce, in appreciable amounts, the anticancer drugs anhydrofusaru-bin and beauvericin ( 12) and vinblastine and vincristine ( 13), respectively. An isolate of F. oxysporum cultured from Juniperus recurva was shown to produce the aryltetralin lignin podophyllotoxin ( 14), which is a precursor for the chemical synthesis of antican- cer drugs like etoposide, teniposide, and etopophose ( 15,16). Podophyllotoxin is also known for its antiviral ( 17) and antiparasitic ( 18) activity. In an ongoing microbial tracking study of the International Space Station (ISS), two F. oxysporum isolates were cultured from the dining table in the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes of these two isolates were sequenced and compared to 65 other F. oxysporum isolates.Thepredictedproteinswereannotatedandminedforthepresence of secondary metabolites and putative virulence factors. The virulence of these isolatesin an immunocompromised (MAPKK-decient) Caenorhabditis elegans model of inva- sive fusariosis was also assessed. This is the rst study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built environment as well as one that has been exposed to space. RESULTS Two F. oxysporum isolates (designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4) were cultured from the dining table of the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes were paired-end sequenced(2H11003100bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size, resulting in 48 million (ISS-F3) and 42 million (ISS-F4) reads. These paired-end reads were de novo assembled into scaffolds (k-mer size H1100586) using ABySS (version 2.0.2) ( 19). The assembled genome size for ISS-F3 was 53.6Mb and for ISS-F4 was 53.8Mb, which iscomparabletothegenomesizeofthemodelstrain, F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici strain 4287 (59.9Mb) ( 20).Table 1provides general assembly statistics of the draft genomes ofF. oxysporum ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Phylogenetic relationship of ISS-F3F4 among different F. oxysporum f. sp.The conserved marker gene translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 H9251) was used to determine the phylogenetic relatedness of ISS-F3F4 to 62 other F. oxysporum strains, belonging to various formae speciales, and seven strains belonging to other Fusarium species included as outgroups, based on clonal (asexual) vertical inheritance. EF-1 H9251 allowsforphylogeneticspeciesrecognitionbecauseitisapplicableacross Fusarium and it is informative at or near the species level and orthologous across the genus ( 21). Based on EF-1 H9251phylotyping, F. oxysporum can be divided into 3 distinct clades with various clonal lineages within each clade ( 22,23). The phylogenetic tree inferred in Fig. 1Aclusters ISS-F3F4 into clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage closely related to 4 other strains: three members of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and the non-plant- pathogenic biocontrol strain Fo47 (members of a clonal lineage have the same se-quence of conserved genes). Three other isolates of interest are highlighted in Fig. 1A because they too had been isolated from harsh environments, two cultured fromISS-grown Zinnia hybrida plants that caused foliar, stem, and root rot (VEG-01C1 andTABLE 1 General assembly statistics for the draft genomes of Fusarium oxysporum ISS-F3F4 strains IsolateRead count (million) k-mer size N50(bp)No. of scaffolds (total)No. of scaffolds over 1 kbMax scaffold length (Mb)Genome size (Mb) GC content () Coverage ( H11547) ISS-F3 48 86 923,684 6,166 736 3.24 53.6 47.05 90 ISS-F4 42 86 940,233 7,066 948 2.23 53.8 46.88 80Urbaniak et al.

The ISS Z. hybrida strains fell into a different branch from ISS-F3F4 and were most closely related to IMV00293. F. oxysporum genomes consist of a core set of housekeeping genes and an accessory genome which is not required for vegetative growth but contains most of,if not all, the genes that allow the fungus to invade and cause disease in a host plant( 20). Utilizing 104 effector candidates, van Dam et al. were able to show that strains infecting the same host generally possess a similar set of effectors and that theseeffectors are often identical within a forma specialis ( 24).

The ISS-F3F4 strains do not contain asmany effector genes as (almost) all of the plant pathogens examined and do notpossess any of the SIX genes (see top panel of Fig. 1B), which encode secreted fungal proteins that were rst discovered in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants and havea well-studied role in plant pathogenesis ( 26,27). Relationship between ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Further analyses were conducted to determine how closely related ISS-F3 and ISS-F4 were to each other. The sequences of 10 phylogenetically informative loci ( 28) were compared between the two strains, and for all 10 loci, the sequences were identical between ISS-F3F4. Second, a BLASTcomparisonwasperformedusingcontigsabove2kbforeachstrain.UsingISS-F3asthe query, each of the 682 contigs matched a contig in ISS-F4 with either 99 or 100identity with an E value of 0. Last, when single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysiswas performed against the reference genome Fo47, ISS-F3F4 had the same singlenucleotidevariants.Forthisreason,itisbelievedthatISS-F3F4areclonalderivativesofeach other. Strain identication. Based on EF-1 H9251phylogeny ( Fig. 1A) and the presence absenceofeffectorproteins( Fig.1B),ISS-F3F4appearedtobethemostcloselyrelated to Fo47. To determine whether the ISS strains were Fo47 or represented a distinctstrain, two in silicogenomic comparisons were conducted. (i) k-mer comparison. The KMC2 k-mer counter ( 29) was used to generate 50-bp long k-mers from 65 F. oxysporum genomes that were downloaded from GenBank (see Table S1 in Data Set S5 in the supplemental material). The k-mers generated from eachgenome were compared against the k-mers from all other genomes to nd the onesthat were specic to each of the 65 genomes analyzed. From all genome-specick-mers that were identied, a subset was chosen from each genome to create the F. oxysporum k-mer database. These sequences were chosen based on number of occur- rences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome)andthetypeofsequence(thesequencedidnotcontainalotofrepeatsandhadagoodbalance of GC and AT ratios). The sequences making up this database are listed inTable S2. The assembled genomes of ISS-F3F4 were then compared using BLAST against the F. oxysporum k-mer database, and for ISS-F3F4 to be considered one of the 65 F. oxysporum strains, every k-mer in the database belonging to a specic strain had to have a perfect match in the genome. For example, all k-mers generated for strain Fo47in the database needed to match sequences in either the ISS-F3 or -F4 genome 100(i.e., 50-bp k-mer50-bp genome no mismatches) for ISS-F3 or -F4 to be consideredFo47. None of the Fo47 unique k-mer sequences matched sequences in the ISS-F3 or ISS-F4 genome, and only 1 k-mer from strains radicis-lycopersici 26381 (CL57), UASWS AC1, lycopersici Fol074, and melonisFom009 found an exact match. Based on the criteria above, ISS-F3F4 were not the same strain as Fo47 nor any of the other 64strains tested. (ii) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. SNP genotyping was the second in silicocomparative method used to determine the relatedness of the ISS isolates to that of Fo47. Using Fo47 as the reference genome, the number of SNPs inthegenomesofISS-F3F4comparedtoFo47wascalculated,alongwithotherstrainsasa comparison. These additional strains are listed in Table S3 in Data Set S5, along withthe reasons for choosing them. Phylogenies of these isolates inferred using maximumGenomics of Fusarium oxysporum Cultured from the ISS MarchApril 2019 Volume 4 Issue 2 e00345-18 msystems.asm.org 5likelihood from SNP sequences in coding regions across every genome indicate that they are distinct from Fo47 and the other strains included ( Fig. 2A).

The total numbers of SNPs in ISS-F3F4 were 150,000 and 152,000, which are more than lycopersici Fol016 and radicis-lycopersici 26381 (also known as CL57), which are well-dened, characterized strains, known to be different than Fo47. Annotation of ISS-F3F4 genes. Using the gene prediction program AUGUSTUS (30), ISS-F3 was predicted to contain 16,648 genes and ISS-F4 had 16,729 genes. This number is very close to the predicted number of genes (17,735) for the model strain,F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 4287 ( 20,31). The predicted genes were annotated with BLAST2GO, and 47 of the genes in ISS-F3 and 56 in ISS-F4 could be matched toknown proteins while the remaining genes were listed as hypothetical (Data Sets S 1 and S2). Among the predicted genes, 273 genes in ISS-F3 and 76 genes in ISS-F4 had no similarity to fungal genes in the NCBI database (Data Sets S 1and S2) and could possibly represent novel, unidentied fungal proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) functionalannotation was also performed with BLAST2GO, and 65 of the predicted genes inISS-F3 and 68 in ISS-F4 could be assigned a function (Data Sets S 1and S2). The most frequently represented GO functional assignments were metabolic and cellular pro-cesses (category: biological processes), catalytic activity and binding (category: meta-bolic function), and membrane and membrane part components (category: cellularcomponent) ( Fig. 3A). A summary of the 50 most abundant GO terms in each of the 3 categories mentioned above is presented in Fig. S1. Approximately 15 of the pre-dicted genes were classied as enzymes, with hydrolases dominating followed bytransferases ( Fig. 3B). Protein families were classied and domains predicted with InterProScan, and 91 of the predicted proteins in ISS-F3F4 could be assigned a function. Abundant proteindomains in ISS-F3F4 were the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) domain, the Zn(2)-C6fungal-type DNA-binding domain, the fungal transcription factor domain, the ankyrinrepeat-containing domain, and the protein kinase domain ( Fig. 4A). The abundant protein families were the NAD(P)-binding domain superfamily, MFS transporter super-family, P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, Zn(2)-C6 fungal-typeDNA-binding domain superfamily, and the alphabeta hydrolase fold ( Fig. 4B). A comparison was performed between the ISS strains isolated during this study and anon-plant-pathogenic biocontrol soil isolate (Fo47) and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a).While the most abundant domains and families in ISS-F3F4 were also the mostabundantonesinFo47andFOSC-3a,thecollectiveproportionsdiffered,withFo47andFOSC-3a more similar to each other than to ISS-F3F4 ( Fig. 4). There were also many domainsandfamiliesthatwerepresentinFo47andFOSC-3athatwerenotfoundintheISS-F3F4 genomes and vice versa (Fig. S2). Data Set S3 shows the full list of proteindomains and families present in each of the different strains and the relative abun-dances of each within each genome. Identication of candidate pathogenicity proteins and secondary metabolites. Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large, multidomain protein complexes that catalyze the sequential production of a diverse array of secondary metabolites (SM) with a range ofbiological activities, including pigmentation, plant growth regulation, plant pathoge-nicityinvasion, and toxicity toward humans and animals, with some having potentialfordrugdevelopmentandhumanbenet( 3234).DifferentPKSscatalyzethesynthesis ofstructurallydistinctpolyketides,andtodate52PKSshavebeenidentiedin Fusarium with 16 found in F. oxysporum (35). Due to the importance of PKS in SM production, predicted proteins composed of PKS domains, based on the InterProScan results above, were further studied to identifywhich PKSs (and the resulting polyketides) ISS-F3F4 have the potential to express. Theamino acid sequences of ISS-F3F4 proteins with PKS domains were compared usingBLAST against a database composed of PKSs identied from 12 strains of F. oxysporum and 9 other Fusarium species ( 35). The BLAST searches revealed the presence of 11 PKSs in the genomes of ISS-F3F4 which have all been detected in other F. oxysporum strains (Fig. 5).

In addition to the 11 PKS proteins identied in ISS-F3F4, there were two proteins with ketoacyl synthase domains that did not matchanythinginthedatabaseandcouldpossiblyrepresentnovel,yet-unidentied Fusarium PKSs. A more extensive SM assessment was performed with antiSMASH, which identied 47 biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome of ISS-F3 and 46 in ISS-F4. To put thisnding into perspective, 44 biosynthetic gene clusters were identied in Fo47 while 47clusters were present in the FOSC-3a.

While ISS-F3,ISS-F4,andFo47hadclustersinvolvedintypeIIIpolyketideproduction,FOSC-3adidnot appear to have that machinery in its genome. A summary of the biosynthetic geneclusters detected in the ISS-F3, ISS-F4, Fo47, and FOSC-3a genomes is shown in Fig. S3. Virulence of F. oxysporum strains estimated in C. elegans model. F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici strain4287,awell-characterizedmodelpathogenoftomatoplants,was shown to produce systemic disease in immunocompromised mice, resulting in a highdeathrate( 36).Utilizing F. oxysporum strain4287knockoutmutantsthatexhibitaltered virulence in tomato plants, it was shown that certain virulence factors essential in plantpathogenesis were dispensable in mammalian pathogenesis and vice versa ( 36). This raises the possibility that certain phytopathogens could also be virulent in humansdepending on their health status. This is concerning given the fact that a recent studyon the impact of space on fungal pathogenesis has shown that Aspergillus fumigatus isolates cultured from ISS surfaces were more virulent in a zebrash model of invasiveaspergillosis than Earth-based clinical isolates ( 37). This prompted the examination of the virulence potential of ISS-F3F4 in an immu- nocompromised (MAPKK-decient) C. elegans model of invasive fusariosis. Included for comparison was an F. oxysporum strain, IMV00293, isolated in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, own to the ISS and grown for 12days (293gr), and grownconcomitantly on Earth (293sp). Figure 6 demonstrates the effect of ve strains of F. oxysporum on mortality of C. elegansAU37. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of C. elegans analyzed with the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test demonstrated that the virulence of F. oxysporum ISS-F4 was signi- cantly greater than other strains ( PH110210.0001) (Fig. 6A).

The sequences of predicted genes that had a ketoacyl synthase domain (one of 3 essential domains in polyketide synthases PKSs) were compared with BLAST against a PKS database ( 35) to determine which PKSs ISS-F3F4 had the ability to produce. Eleven PKSs found in ISS-F3F4 are also present in 12 other F. oxysporum species that have been previously studied ( 35). However, there were two additional PKSs, unkA and unkB, in ISS-F3F4 that did not have any matches in the database.

The hypha-related killing of ISS-F4 was still signicantly greater than other strains ( PH11005 0.0129) (Fig. 6B).

The phylogenetic placement ofthesetwostrainsbasedonEF-1 H9251nucleotidesequenceandwhole-genomeSNPsshows that they are within the genetic variation of terrestrial strains and that their ability tothrive in the space environment was not contingent on enhanced genetic variation. F. oxysporum strains are well known for their plant pathogenicity, and for successful infection of its plant host, effector proteins are secreted from the fungus that aid in thecolonization process. Performing disease assays to determine host specicity is bothlaborious and time-consuming; however, a recent molecular screening method basedon 104 effector proteins was developed by van Dam et al. which can predict hostspecicity in F. oxysporum ( 24).

The ISS isolates also did not contain any of the 14 secreted in xylem(SIX)effectorgenes,whichencodecysteine-richsecretedproteinsthatappearto manipulate host defenses to promote infection ( 38). Based on the effector content, it is unlikely that ISS-F3F4 are plant pathogens. VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, isolated fromZ. hybrida plants grown on the ISS and whole-genome sequences ( 39) also displayed relatively few effector genes ( Fig. 1B) and were unable to infect healthy Z. hybrida plants (G. Massa, personal communication). Based on effector content and EF-1 H9251phylogeny, ISS-F3F4 appeared to be the most closely related to Fo47, a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate known for its biocontrolproperties. Based on the number of SNPs across the genome, the phylogeny inferred FIG 7Images of C. elegans AU37 with hyphae of F. oxysporum ISS-F4 piercing through worm body.

Thus, it appears that these ISS isolates represent a genomicallyunique strain, which has not yet been identied and characterized to date. TheISSisahermeticallysealedsystem,closedofffromitssurroundingenvironment, with microbial introduction being of terrestrial origin from astronauts and payloads.ISS-F3F4 were most likely introduced in the same fashion, so it begs the question whythey had been identied only on the ISS and not on Earth, where 150 formae speciales have already been characterized ( 2). One hypothesis is that ISS-F3F4 are present in relatively low abundances on Earth but were selected because of their ability towithstand ISS-associated environmental pressures such as increased radiation, whichcomparedtoterrestrialindoorbuildings,is100timesgreater.InarecentstudybyByrneet al., it was found that Escherichia coli developed extreme resistance to ionizing radiation, comparable to that observed with Deinococcus radiodurans , with mutations in only 9 genes, all of which happen to be involved in radiation resistance ( 40). When these mutations were repaired, resistance was lost and the cells became sensitive toradiation ( 40). This paper showed for the rst time that evolution of resistance may occur via genetic adaptation rather than passive mechanisms based on changes incellular proteins. We therefore hypothesized that based on the sequences of ve genesknown to have a role in radiation resistance in fungi, ISS-F3F4 would appear to bemore closely related to IMV00293 (Chernobyl isolate) and VEG-01C1VEG-01C2 (ISS Z. hybridaisolates) (as they are strains also isolated from high-radiation environments) compared to 64 other F. oxysporum strains. An inferred maximum likelihood tree was constructed from concatenated sequences of rad54,rad53,rad51,rad2, and phr1(a photolyase) found in ISS-F3, ISS-F4, IMV00293, VEG-01C1, VEG-01C2, and 64 other F. oxysporum strains. The branching observed with the radiation resistance genes was similar to that observed with EF-1 H9251in which ISS-F3F4 grouped together, apart from IMV00293, VEG-01C1, and VEF-01C2, which grouped together, with all ve isolatesbeing within the genetic variation of the 64 other strains included (see Fig. S4 in thesupplementalmaterial).AproteomicsapproachmayprovidemoreinsightintowhetherISS-F3F4 have a selective advantage for survival on the ISS and what that may entail. The genomes of ISS-F3F4 were largely made up of gene ontology categories involved in metabolic and cellular processes and catalytic activity and binding. Overall,the relative abundances of GO categories for ISS-F3F4 were similar to that observed inFOSC-3a, a clinical isolate, and Fo47, a biocontrol, non-plant-pathogenic strain. How-ever, there were differences in the relative abundances and presenceabsence ofprotein domains and families between ISS-F3F4 and FOSC-3a and Fo47, highlightingtheuniquenessofthesestrains.OnesuchdifferencewasthehigherrelativeabundanceofgenesencodingpolyketidesynthasedomainsinISS-F3F4.EachPKSmakesauniquepolyketide, which collectively represent structurally diverse natural products withcommercial signicance for the pharmaceutical industries ( 41). A testament to its importanceisreectedintheannualsalesofpharmaceuticalsderivedfrompolyketides,which routinely reach 20 billion ( 42). For example, the anticancer drugs tetracycline and doxorubicin, the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, the antibiotics erythromycinand rifamycin, and the fungicide strobilurin are all polyketides that have been isolatedfrom either bacteria or fungi ( 43). A BLAST search against a PKS database ( 35) showed thatISS-F3F4hadthegenomicmachinerytoproduce13polyketides,11ofwhichhavebeen found in other F. oxysporum strains. The two sequences in ISS-F3F4 that did not have any matches in the PKS database did match F. oxysporum hypothetical proteins in NCBI.Amoreextensiveanalysisusingproteomicsandmetabolomicswillbeperformedto elucidate the natural product repertoire of ISS-F3F4. F. oxysporum , though a well-known plant pathogen, may cause various infections in humans and is a cause of emerging infections in immunodecient patients ( 4446). Vertebrate and nonvertebrate models are well established to test pathogens for theirpotential virulence ( 36,4749). For virulence testing of F. oxysporum , a host is usually immunosuppressed to make it susceptible to fungal infection ( 50). Symptoms ofUrbaniak et al. MarchApril 2019 Volume 4 Issue 2 e00345-18 msystems.asm.org 14disseminatedfusariosiscausedby F. oxysporum areremarkablysimilarbetweenanimals and humans. They include development of invasive structures, including hypha micro-conidia and chlamydospores, causing massive colonization of organs, and which cancause thrombosis and necrosis ( 4,50,51). The nonvertebrate host C. elegans ,a free-living soil nematode, is one of the most useful models to study the virulence offungi and is well established by many researchers ( 5254).C. elegans has an innate immune response mechanism that is activated in the response to pathogens, includingfungi ( 55,56). A key component of the C. elegans immune response is the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway ( 57). SEK-1 encodes a mitogen- activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in this pathway and thus plays a vital role inpathogen resistance in C. elegans ( 58). For this reason, SEK-1 mutants are considered immunocompromised worms. Matricidal hatching of progeny inside the parentworms occurs in SEK-1-decient C. elegans , and therefore, a mutation in glp-4, a locus required for normal proliferation of the germ line ( 59), is required to avoid bias effects due to progeny hatching. The glp-4mutants are sterile at the restrictive temperature of 25C, at which C. elegans experiments are performed. Usingthe glp-4sek-1 mutantstrainAU37of C. elegans obtainedfromtheCaenorhabditis Genetics Center, we observed that ISS-F4 was the most virulent, even compared to ISS-F3,despite the fact that ISS-F3F4 have very similar genomes and initially were thought to beclonal derivatives of each other. Since ISS-F4 demonstrated killing ability by both hyphapiercing-related and -unrelated mechanisms, it is likely that it produces secreted virulencefactors. It is known that secreted proteins such as RP-1-like ( 60) and secreted in xylem (SIX) proteins( 61),whichareregulatedby Fusarium transcriptionfactor1(FTF1)( 62),arerequired for full virulence of F. oxysporum . Further work is required to determine if there are differences in production and regulation of the secreted factors between ISS-F3F4 strainsand if time-dependent exposure to the ISS environment may affect this regulation.

Surfaces (1m2) were sampled on the ISS using premoistened 9-in. by 9-in. polyester wipes (ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were prepared as part of an ongoing microbialtrackingstudyduringightsampling3(6May2016).Wipeswerestoredatroomtemperature(RT)beforebeing brought back to Earth, 6days after sampling, where they were processed as described previously( 63). Material from the wipes was plated, 100 H9262l, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol (nal concentration, 100 H9262gml) and incubated at 25C for 7 days. Fusarium oxysporum , identied by morphology and ITS region sequencing, was isolated from the ISS dining table. The twoisolates were designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Whole-genome sequencing. (i) Genomic DNA extraction. Freezer stocks of ISS-F3F4 were plated onpotatodextroseagar(PDA)platesandincubatedat25Cfor5days,atwhichtimetheentireplatewascovered with fungal growth. The growth over the entire plate was scraped into a sterile mortar andpestle containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen. The colonies were ground into a powder and thentransferred into PowerBead tubes from the MoBio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, USA; catalognumber 12888), and the extraction protocol was followed per the manufacturers instructions, except forthe last step, in which DNA was eluted in 80 H9262l of solution C6 (i.e., elution buffer). DNA was stored at H1100220C until sent for sequencing. (ii) Sequencing and assembly. GenomicDNAwaspaired-endsequenced(2 H11003100bp)witha350-bp insert size on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Totals of 48 millionreads for F3 and 42 million reads for F4 were generated. Trimmomatic on the Galaxy server ( https: usegalaxy.org ) was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings: maximum mismatch, 2; accuracy of the match between the two adaptor-ligated reads, 30; accuracy of the match between any adaptor,10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings: minimum quality required to keep a base, 3).Postprocessed reads were de novoassembled using ABySS version 2.0.2 ( 19) using the default settings. Different k-mer sizes ranging from 68 to 90 were tested in order to nd the one that gave the highestN 50scoreandlowestnumberofscaffoldscontigs,afterassembly.Thek-mersize86gavethebestresults for both F3 and F4, and the resulting assemblies were used for downstream analyses. Phylogenetic analysis. Thephylogenyofthenewlyidentiedstrainswasassessedbyextractingthe full-length gene sequence of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 H9251) from each of the genomes using BLASTN. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters ( 64), and phylogeny was inferred with PhyML ( 65) (1,000 bootstraps; percent bootstrap condence is shown in red numbers in the tree). The trees were visualized using ETE 3 ( 66). The effector clustering was done on only the F. oxysporum strains, using the list of 104 curated F. oxysporum effector candidate genes and the same clustering method as described in the work of van Dam et al. ( 24). Briey, 2.5-kb regions up- and downstream of a miniature impala (mimp) transposable element were scanned for potential open reading frames (ORFs) containing a signal peptide. This procedure was previously done by van Dam etGenomics of Fusarium oxysporum Cultured from the ISS MarchApril 2019 Volume 4 Issue 2 e00345-18 msystems.asm.org 15al. (24) for 59 individual isolates of F. oxysporum , and the resulting effector candidate genes were grouped and merged into a list. Obvious false positives and transposable elements were removed, and multiple instances of the same effector were reduced to one representative. This curated list representsthe effectorome of a varied set of plant-pathogenic formae speciales ofF. oxysporum . Screening for the presenceoftheputative104effectorswasdoneusingBLASTN(asdescribedabove).Abinarydatamatrixwas generated containing presence (1) or absence (0) of each candidate in each genome. This tablewas used as input for hierarchical clustering performed in R, using a Jaccard binary distance matrix andaverage linkage. The resulting matrix was visualized using the heatmap3 package in R. The sequences of the 10 phylogenetically informative loci used to compare ISS-F3F4 were extracted from the genomes using the sequences of these genes in the reference genome of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 4287. The sequences were kindly provided by Li-Jun Ma from the University of Massachusetts atAmherst.Thelociandchromosomallocationsfromthereferencegenomeareasfollows:chromosome1, DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC2 and RPB1; chromosome 4, minichromosome mainte-nance protein 3 and anaphase-promoting complex subunit 1; chromosome 5, two hypothetical proteins,FOXG 1751.3 and 2073.3; chromosome 7, DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2; chromosome8, hypothetical protein FOXG 3560.3; and chromosome 9, clathrin heavy chain and DNA polymerasegamma ( 28). k-mer analysis for strain identication. The KMC2 k-mer counter ( 29) tool was used to generate 50-bp-long k-mers from 65 F. oxysporum genomes that were downloaded from GenBank ( ftp:ftp.ncbi .nlm.nih.govgenomesgenbankfungiFusarium_oxysporum ) (see Table S1 in Data Set S5 in the sup- plementalmaterial).TheKMC2programwasalsousedtodeterminewhichofthek-mersgeneratedfromeach genome were unique to that genome. A subset of the unique k-mers were chosen, based onnumberofoccurrences(choseniftheyappearedonce,insteadofmultipletimeswithinthegenome)andthe type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC andAT ratios). Using command line BLAST (version ncbi-blast-2.4.0 H11001), the genomes of F3 and F4 were used as the query against the database of unique k-mer sequences. For ISS- F3 or ISS-F4 to be consideredoneofthe65 F. oxysporum strains,everyk-merinthedatabasebelongingtoaspecicstrainhadtohave a perfect match against a sequence in either the F3 or F4 genome. Single nucleotide polymorphism detection and phylogenetic analysis. We applied a reference- based analysis method to determine the relatedness of F3 and F4 to the reference genome, Fo47, andto5other F. oxysporum isolates.Thelistofthesestrainsandthereasonsforincludingthemintheanalysis are presented in Table S3 in Data Set S5. These publicly available genomes were downloaded from theNCBI sequence read archive (SRA). SNP identication was carried out using PhaME (version 1.0.2) ( 67), which uses Nucmer for pairwise alignment of genomes. Evolutionary analyses and phylogenetic treeswere constructed as part of the PhaME pipeline. The numbers of SNPs spanning the entire genome, incoding regions, and in noncoding regions were extracted from the PhaME output using a custom Perlscript and plotted in Prism (version 7). In order to detect SNPs in the coding regions, a gff annotation leof the reference genome (Fo47) was supplied as input. Gene prediction and annotation. The genes of the assembled ISS-F3F4 genomes were pre- dicted with the AUGUSTUS gene prediction program using default settings and trained againstFusarium graminearum ( 30,68). The amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were uploaded into Blast2GO ( https:www.blast2go.com )(69), and annotation was performed with blastp-fast against the NCBI nonredundant database, set to the fungi taxonomy lter. The E value cutoff was set toH110211.0EH1100210. Gene ontology classication and InterProScan were also performed with Blast2GO using the default settings. Identication of polyketides and secondary metabolites. Predicted proteins that were annotated as polyketide synthases were further evaluated with the polyketide synthase database ( 35), which consists of amino acid sequences of PKSs from 12 F. oxysporum strains and 8 other Fusarium species. A blastp search was performed with F3 and F4 sequences, and a positive match was based on H1102295 identity and an E value of H110211EH1100210. Biosynthetic gene clusters were predicted with the fungal version of antiSMASH ( https:fungismash .secondarymetabolites.org ). The input les were the (i) assembled whole-genome nucleotide sequences and (ii) gff annotation le produced from AUGUSTUS. Default settings were used in the run. C. elegans model for Fusarium oxysporum virulence. The glp-4sek-1 mutant strain AU37 of C. elegans obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center ( http:www.cbs.umn.eduresearch resourcescgc ) was used in the experiments. C. elegans AU37 nematodes were synchronized for the experiment as previously described ( 70). Synchronizednematodeswerethengrownon E. coliOP50lawnsuntiltheyreachedtheL3-L4stage.Then nematodes (about 300 worms) were collected and washed 3 times in 10ml of M9 buffer ( 71) containing 50H9262gml kanamycin. On the last washing, worms were incubated in 10ml M9 buffer containing 50H9262gml kanamycin for 1h to clean the intestinal tube and surface of nematodes from E. coli. After cleaning, nematodes were poured on plain agar plates (1.5 agar in water) to soak the kanamycinsolution into agar. At this point, synchronized fasting nematodes were ready for transferring intoexperimental fungal conidium suspensions. Fungal conidium suspensions were prepared by growing the fungal strains on PDA plates and incubating them at 25C for 7days, at which time the plate was overgrown with growth. Eight millilitersof ST solution (8.5g NaCl, 1ml Tween 80 in 1liter of water) was poured onto the plates, and a cottonswab was used to scrape all the moistened fungi off the plate. The liquid suspension on the plate wasthen transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube, spun down at 3,500 H11003gfor 5min, and washed 3 times with sterilePBS.Thepelletwasthenresuspendedin5mlofsterilePBS.TocountthenumberofconidiaintheUrbaniak et al. MarchApril 2019 Volume 4 Issue 2 e00345-18 msystems.asm.org 16suspension, a 110 dilution was prepared using ST solution and conidia were counted using a hemo- cytometer under the 40 H11003objective of a light microscope. Conidial stocks were diluted in PBS to 107 conidiaml prior to the experiment. Twenty microliters of 107-conidiaml F. oxysporum spores were suspended in 1ml of 30 (volvol) brain heart infusion broth (BHI broth; Remel, USA) prepared by dilution of BHI broth in M9 buffer. Foreach conidium suspension, 60 worms were transferred from plain agar plates into 1ml of a conidiumsuspension and incubated for 1h at 25C without agitation. After incubation, the entire reaction volumeof conidium suspension with worms was transferred to a 60-mm dish containing 2ml of M9 bufferwith 50 H9262gml kanamycin. Then, worms were collected by a micropipette and transferred to a 60-mm dish containing 3ml of M9 buffer with 50 H9262gml kanamycin. This procedure was repeated 3 times using 3ml of fresh M9 buffer with 50 H9262gml kanamycin in a 60-mm dish at each transfer. After nal washing, 10 worms were transferred into each experimental 30-mm dish (3 dishes per onefungal strain conidium suspension) containing 2ml of 30 BHI broth and 50 H9262gml kanamycin. Worms were incubated at 25C without agitation, and worm death was estimated at 17, 24, 44, and50hafterconidiumexposureusinganOlympusSZX16microscope( H110035magnication)withacamera (Olympus DP30BW) for imaging.
