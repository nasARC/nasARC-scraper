Our ndings offer new insights into highly sophis- ticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against her-bivory and pathogen invasion. Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range informationexchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian ner-vous systems, many different types of chemical substances, includingamino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, nor-epinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve asneurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then acti- vate ion channels, and consequently produce ion ux 1,t h e r e b yi n d u - cing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation forneurotransmission 14. Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signalsfrom the site of perception to the distal tissues 5. In response to her- bivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signalingmolecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind cor- responding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials(SWPs) 69, initiate transmission of cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2cyt)1015, and consequently activate biosynthesis of defensive phytohormonejasmonic acid (JA), thereby mediating expression of defense-responsive genes for systemic defense responses in plants 7,8,11,12,1618. Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effec- tively mediate neurotransmission in mammals4.H o w e v e r ,i np l a n t kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu)and the recently discovered Ricca s factor -THIOGLUCOSIDE GLU- COHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far de ned as wound signals that depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein ofmammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemicReceived: 19 June 2024 Accepted: 14 February 2025 Check for updates 1MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, and School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 10 0084, China.2Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.3Key Laboratory of Seed Innovation, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.4Hainan Key Laboratory for Biosafety Monitoring and Molecular Breeding in Off-Season Reproduction Regions, Institute of Tropical Bioscience and Biotechnology  San Ya Research Institute, Chinese Ac ademy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Haikou, China.5Department of Plant Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.6State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changsha 410125, China.7These authors contributed equally: Rui Li, Yongfang Yang. e-mail: wang.620osu.edu ;jianbinlabcaas.cn ;shanxy80mail.tsinghua.edu.cn ;daoxinlabmail.tsinghua.edu.cn Nature Communications  (2025) 16:1915 11234567890():,; 1234567890():,;plant defense response6,7,11. In this study, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library19iden- tied a glutathione (GSH)-de cient mutant that highly accumulated Glu, the previously de ned molecule crucial for activation of plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibited attenuation of defense sig- naling events. We further uncovered GSH as a critical signaling mole-cule that relies on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance propagation ofcalcium-based defense signaling events. Results Identi cation of GSH as a signaling molecule that activates long- distance plant defens e signaling events During the genetic screening of the rolling circle ampli cation- mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library19,20for mutants with altered defense response to a disastrous plant fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea ), we identi ed a mutant, termed hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52 ), which exhibited obvious susceptibility to B. cinerea infection (Supplementary Fig. 1). A single gene AT4G23100 was identi ed with PCR analysis on the mutant genomic DNA19,20. To further verify that the decreased resistance in the hr-52 mutant is caused by the interference with AT4G23100 gene, we obtained the previously reported mutant pad2-1 with the Ser298Asn substitution (S298N) within AT4G2310021to assess its responses to B. cinerea infection and insect attack. The results showed that pad2-1 exhibited severe susceptibility to B. cinerea and Spodoptera exigua , a globally agricultural pest, while genetic transformation of pad2-1 with PAD2 (AT4G23100 ) completely restored the resistance (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Our results together with the previous ndings2123 demonstrate that AT4G23100 gene is essential for plant defense response against B. cinerea infection and insect attack. It was known that the AT4G23100 gene encodes the gamma- glutamylcysteine synthetase catalyzing the reaction between Glu andcysteine for generation of glutamylcysteine in the GSH biosynthesispathway 24. We found that a high level of Glu (875.42 gg FW) was accumulated in the pad2-1 mutant compared to WT (494.96 gg FW) while the GSH content in pad2-1 (4.91gg FW) was severely decreased to 5.9 of WT (82.94 gg FW) (Fig. 1a, b). It is surprising that such a high level of Glu failed to induce plant defense in pad2-1 (Supple- mentary Figs. 2 and 3), which seems to be inconsistent with the pre-viously de ned role of Glu as a critical wound signal that activates plant defense response 11. The observed susceptibility in the GSH-de cient pad2-1 mutant suggests an indispensable role for GSH in plant defense, which encourages us to further investigate whether GSH acts as woundsignal to trigger long distance calcium-based defense signaling events. To verify the role of GSH in activating long-distance plant defense signaling events, we wounded leaf 1 of pad2-1 and Col-0, and then measured the accumulation of wound-induced plant defensive hor-monal molecules in leaf 6, considering that leaf n shares direct vascular connections with leaves n  5 and n  8 while leaves n  3 may represent contact parastichies formed by proximal but unconnected vasculaturein adult Arabidopsis rosettes 7,25. Consistent with the reduced plant resistance in pad2-1 , the defensive phytohormone jasmonates were obviously decreased in the leaf 6 of pad2-1 to 63.04 (for JA) and 45.81 (for JA-Ile) of those in Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1c, d). Moreover, the expression of JA-inducible defense marker genes OPR3 , JAZ5,a n d JAZ7 was also signi cantly attenuated in leaf 6 of pad2-1 compared to Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1e). These results sug- gest that GSH might serve as a critical signaling molecule essential foractivation of plant systemic defense signaling events. To further explore the underlying mechanism of GSH in activating systemic plant defense responses, we introduced the Ca 2cytreporter GCaMP3 into pad2-1 , generating GCaMP3 pad2-1 plant, to investigate whether the GSH-de cient mutant attenuated the wound-induced systemic Ca2cyttransmission. Upon mechanical wounding of leaf 1, both amplitude and kinetics of Ca2cytpropagation in leaf 6 werereduced in GCaMP3 pad2-1 compared with GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 1f, g; Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). The peak valueof Ca 2cytuorescence changes in leaf 6 of GCaMP3pad2-1 was reduced to 44.15 of that in GCaMP3 (Fig. 1h). Consistently, the per- centage of each systemic leaf that showed apparent increased Ca2cyt uorescence was reduced in GCaMP3pad2-1 (Fig. 1i). These data reinforce the role of GSH in triggering the wound-induced systemicCa 2cytpropagation in plants. Taken together, the above-mentioned data suggest that GSH might serve as an important wound signal that triggers wound-inducedsystemic Ca 2cyttransmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses. GSH triggers long-distance Ca2cyttransmission To further validate that GSH acts as a wound signal triggering long- distance plant defense signaling events, we applied GSH (with Glu and sorbitol as positive and negative controls, respectively) to leaf 1 of theGCaMP3 plants and visualized the systemic Ca 2cytin the whole seedlings (Fig. 2a, b). Intriguingly, the fast and transient increase of Ca2cytwas notably triggered in systemic leaves (including leaf 3, 4, and 6) by GSH (Supplementary Movie 3) at the level comparable to thatinduced by Glu (Fig. 2a). Speci cally, Ca 2cytrapidly increased to the peak value in leaf 6 at 230 s upon treatment on leaf 1 with GSH ratherthan sorbitol (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 4), and more distal leaves showed Ca 2cytpropagation with the increased GSH concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, the GSH-triggered systemic Ca2cyt transmission was dramatically repressed by pretreatment on thepetiole of the wounded leaf with the Ca 2channel inhibitor LaCl 3 (Fig. 2e-g). To exclude the possibility that GSH is cleaved by enzymes to release glutamate for Ca signal propagation, we employed GGsTop, a well-known chemical inhibitor that speci cally targets gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), the enzyme responsible for convert-ing GSH to Glu 26. Our results showed that there were no signi cant differences in the Ca signaling response when GSH was used in combination with GGsTop compared to that of GSH treatment alone(Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that GSH was not converted to Glufor activation of systemic Ca 2signaling. Additionally, we synthesized another tripeptide (Glu-Pro-Ala), which contains glutamate along with two different amino acids, and investigated its effects in triggeringsystemic Ca 2signal propagation in plants. Unlike GSH treatment, application of Glu-Pro-Ala failed to induce long-distance transmissionof Ca signal in plants (Supplementary Fig. 7), reinforcing the role of GSH as a signaling molecule that effectively triggers systemic Ca 2cyt propagation in plants. Consistently, GSH application on leaf 1 signi cantly induced the expression of defense-responsive genes ( OPR3 ,JAZ5,a n d JAZ10 )i nl e a f 6 (by 5.6, 8.6 and 5.7 folds), which is comparable to that induced byGlu (Fig. 2d). Moreover, pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with LaCl 3severely reduced the GSH-inducible expression of defense genes in systemic leaves (Fig. 2h), verifying that propagation of Ca2cytis required for GSH-induced defense gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GSH acts as an importantwound signal in triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defensesignaling. GSH activates the transcriptional expression of defense-related genes in plant systemic leaves To get deeper insights into the GSH-triggered systemic defense signaling events in plants, we performed transcriptome pro ling on leaf 6 collected after 1 h application of GSH to leaf 1 of WT plants. We identi ed 378 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the sys- temic leaf of GSH-treated plants compared to non-stimulated mockcontrol plants (Supplementary Data 1). Among them, 354 genesincluding a large number of key defense-responsive genes wereupregulated while 24 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3a), which isArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-57239-1 Nature Communications  (2025) 16:1915 2well consistent with the tendency of transcriptome data from plants in response to wounding, namely, more transcripts are upregulated than downregulated27,28. Gene Ontology analysis (GO) of these DEGs further revealed signi cant enrichment of terms associated with plant defense signaling, including defense response, cellularresponses to JA, response to wounding, and response to hormone(Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 2). Consistent with the transcriptomeanalysis, qRT-PCR also showed that expression of defense marker genes ( CYP94C1 ,JAZ13 ,LOX4 ,OPR3 ,JAZ5,JAZ7 , and JAZ10 )w a s highly induced in the systemic leaf tissues of GSH-treated plants (Fig. 3c, d; Supplementary Fig. 8). These data provide an overview of the GSH-induced gene expression in plant systemic leaf tissues andfurther indicate the important role of GSH in triggering plant long-distance defense signaling. Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-57239-1 Nature Communications  (2025) 16:1915 3To further investigate the relations between GSH and Glu in plant wound response, we generated transcriptome data sets from leaf 6 1 hafter wounding leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 3) or application of Glu to leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 4), and then compared these data to that induced by GSH. This comparison showed that 207 DEGs were co-regulated by wounding and GSH treatment, while 228 DEGs werefound in both GSH and Glu treatment groups. Moreover, a total of 267DEGs from GSH- and Glu-treated gr oups existed in wounding treat- ment, among which 126 genes were co-regulated by GSH, Glu andwounding, 81 genes were only regulated by GSH and wounding, and 60genes were only regulated by Glu and wounding (Fig. 3e). These overlapped genes which are co-regulated by GSH, Glu, and woundingor independently regulated by GSH and wounding, Glu and woundingare all mainly involved in plant defense signaling, including plant response to wounding, stress, JA, and biotic stimulus, regulation of cell communication, and innate immune response, suggesting that GSHand Glu are involved in wound-induced plant systemic defenseresponse. GLR3.3 is required for GSH-triggered systemic Ca2cyt propagation GLR proteins which generally contain an amino-terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain(TMD), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), have broad agonistproles including glycine, cysteine, methionine, Glu and GSH 2932. Specially, Glu-triggered long-distance Ca2cytpropagation is drama- tically inhibited in glr3.3glr3.6 mutant11.T o gure out whether GSH- triggered long-distance calcium signaling depends on GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 ,w ec o m p a r e dt h eG S H - t r i g g e r e dC a2-related signaling events among the glr3.3 ,glr3.6 and WT plants containing the GCaMP3 reporter (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 9). Interestingly, the GSH- triggered systemic Ca2cyttransmission was severely reduced in the GCaMP3glr3.3 (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 4). However, the GSH- triggered systemic Ca2cyttransmission was not markedly attenuated inGCaMP3glr3.6 , which is similar to that of GCaMP3 plant (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 5). Consistently, the GSH-inducible expression of defense marker gene OPR3 ,JAZ5,a n d JAZ10 was signi cantly repressed in the GCaMP3glr3.3 , but not obviously inhibited in the GCaMP3glr3.6 and the GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that GLR3.3 plays a dominant role in regulating GSH-induced Ca2cyt propagation. Similar to the systemic calcium signal transmission uponG S Ht r e a t m e n t ,G l u - i n d u c e d C a 2cytpropagation in systemic leaves were strongly inhibited in GCaMP3glr3.3 while remained unaffected in GCaMP3glr3.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10), con rming that Glu-induced long-distance calcium wave is also dependent on GLR3.38,11. To characterize the interaction between GLR3.3 and GSH, the predicted structure of GLR3.3 was used to perform moleculardocking. The binding model showed that Glu binds to the LBD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3 LBD) (Supplementary Fig. 11), which is consistent with the recent report about the Glu binding to theGLR3.3 LBD29. While GSH was predicted to bind the ATD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3 ATD), which is remarkably different from Glu in terms of binding domains and contacting amino acids(Supplementary Fig. 11). Consistent with the predicted interaction between GLR3.3 ATDand GSH (Supplementary Fig. 11), recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data revealed that GSH binds the ATD of GLR3.430, another GLR protein with high sequence similarity to GLR3.3, reinforcing that GSH might bind the ATD domain of GLR3.3for activation of ion channel. Together with the genetic evidenceshowing GLR3.3 is required for both GSH- and Glu-triggered sys-temic Ca 2cyttransmission (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 10), these results collectively suggest that GSH and Glu may bind to differentdomains of GLR3.3 for activating ion channel activity and triggeringleaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling. Taken together, our results shown in Figs. 14s u g g e s tt h a tG S H serves as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance propagationof Ca 2cytwaves in a GLR3.3-dependent manner, thus inducing rapid JA biosynthesis in systemic leaf organs to protect plants from herbiv- ory ahead of time. Discussion Initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanicaldamages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment. Due tolack of a nervous system, plants have evolved sophisticated mechan-isms to systemically deliver the wound signal from the site of injuredorgans to the distal undamaged tissues, which helps them be well-prepared for upcoming dangers 33.I nt h i ss t u d y ,w e nd that the GSH- decient mutant, in spite of the highly accumulated Glu previously dened as a critical wound signal essential for activating plant defense events, showed impaired plant defense signaling events (Fig. 1;S u p - plementary Figs. 1-3). We further de ne GSH as a critical wound signal that depends on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance calcium-baseddefense signaling in plants (Figs. 24; Supplementary Figs. 5-11). Intri- guingly, in the animal nervous system, GSH has been identi ed as a neuromodulatorneurotransmitter 3436, suggesting a potential con- ceptual parallel in GSH-mediated signal transmission across differentkingdoms of life. Moreover, we noticed that GSH and Glu induceddistinct Ca 2cyttransmission patterns in systemic leaves. Speci cally, the spread of systemic Ca2cyttriggered by GSH is preferentially initiated from marginal veins and rapidly transmitted to the mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 6), whereas Glumediated Ca 2cyttransmission mainly propagated from mid veins to marginal veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 7).Re-examination of the data shown in the previous study revealing Gluas a wound signal also supports our observation that Glu triggersCa 2cyttransmission with the direction of mid-to-marginal veins11. Intriguingly, the transmission pattern of wounding-induced Ca2cyt contained both directions of the mid-to-marginal veins and themarginal-to-mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and SupplementaryMovie 8). Future work to elucidate the mechanisms and biologicalsignicance of different Ca 2cyttransmission patterns induced by GSH and Glu would help us to further understand the highly sophis- ticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend againstinsect attack. When plants are subjected to insect herbivory or mechanical wounding, they rapidly activate the JA signaling pathway in whole plantFig. 1  Defense signaling events are attenuated in GSH-de cient pad2-1 mutant plant. a ,bContents of GSH ( a)a n dG l u( b)i nC o l - 0 , pad2-1 ,PAD2 pad2-1 1 and PAD2 pad2-1 3 plants.

Given that bothcalcium and ROS signals play a role in mediating plant systemicdefense responses to wounding 11,12,3941, exploring the potentialinvolvement of ROS in GSH-triggered systemic defense response would be interesting. Wound-induced systemic defense signaling requires the involve- ment of GLR ion channel proteins, such as GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. Ourstudy found that the GSH-triggered long-distance calcium-mediateddefense response was suppressed in GCaMP3glr3.3 but nearly Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-57239-1 Nature Communications  (2025) 16:1915 6unaffected in GCaMP3glr3.6 (Fig. 4). Similar to GSH, it was also observed that Glu depends on GLR3.3 rather than GLR3.6 to initiate the systemic calcium-based defense signaling (Supplementary Fig. 10). Considering the recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, whichrevealed that GSH and Glu could bind to different domains of GLR3.4for ion channel activation 30, it would be intriguing to investigate whether GSH binds to GLR3.3 and further determine the potentialrelationship between GSH and Glu in activating GLR3.3. Furthermore, in contrast to GSH and Glu, the recently identi ed Ricca s factor TGGs, was shown to rely on both GLR3.6 and GLR3.3 to trigger the systemic defense response6. It would be exciting to further uncover the signal interactions among Glu, TGGs, and GSH in wound-induced systemicdefense signaling.

The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals(neurotransmitters) and electrical signals, where ion uxes are induced by neurotransmitters and the release of neurotransmitters is depen-dent on electrical signals 1,2,42. In contrast, little is known about how signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long-distancesignaling. Previous studies suggest that the dispersal of elicitors suchas Glu may rely on bulk ow and diffusion 14. Given that GSH has a molecular weight similar to that of amino acids, a plausible scenario isthat when plants experience mechanical damage or insect attack, alarge volume of GSH from the intracellular region may surge into the apoplastic region, inducing calcium in ux by activation of the GLR3.3 i o nc h a n n e l .W i t ht h ea c t i o no fd i f f u s i o na n db u l k ow of GSH within the vascular bundles, calcium signals can be rapidly transmittedbetween leaves. In addition to the diffusion and bulk ow theory, other theories have also been proposed, such as the osmoelectric siphonmodel, which is based on membrane depolarization leading to cellwater shedding into the apoplast followed by membrane repolariza-tion and water uptake 43. More recently, osmotic pressure has been suggested to induce the systemic apoplastic release of signalingmolecules like Glu 15. Future studies aimed at uncovering the potential mechanisms underlying GSH-triggered systemic Ca2signal transmis- sion would be fascinating. Methods Plant materials and growth condition hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52) was obtained from the rolling circle ampli cation-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library in our previous study19,20.pad2-1 was ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). Seeds of GCaMP3 were from Simon Gilroy (Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin). The GCaMP3 pad2-1 was generated by genetic crosses using standard procedures. GCaMP3glr3.3 andGCaMP3glr3.6 mutants were generated by CRISPR Cas9 in WT plants overexpressing GCaMP3 . To generate the transgenic plant expressing 35S::PAD2-6mycpad2-1 (PAD2 pad2-1 ), the coding sequence of PAD2 (AT4G23100 ) was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300 , and then transformed into pad2-1 . Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 20 bleach, sown on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After incuba-tion in the dark at 4 C for 2 days, plates were cultivated in a growthchamber at 22 C with a 16 h8 h lightdark (long day, LD) photoperiod.After 7 days, seedlings were then transplanted into soil and grownunder the same condition. For insect feeding and pathogen inocula-tion assays, plants were grown in soil for 4 5 weeks at 22 C with a 10 h 14 h lightdark (short day, SD) photoperiod. For real-time calcium imaging assay, plates were incubated at 4 C for 2 days in the dark andthen transferred to 22 C with a SD photoperiod for 6 7 days. Seed- lings were then transferred onto new plates and grown for additional1416 days prior to use. Real-time Ca2cytimaging in the entire plant Transgenic Arabidopsis plants stably expressing GCaMP3 were imaged with a motorized epi uorescence (SZX10, Olympus) stereomicroscope equipped with a 1  objective lens and a C13440 digital camera (ORCA-Flash4.0 V3, Hamamatsu Photonics). The GFP-based Ca 2indicator GCaMP3 was excited using mercury lamp (X-Cite 120 Q, Excelitas). The green uorescent signal was acquired every 2 s with the C13440 cam- era using Standard imaging software (Olympus). Using ImageJ software, GCaMP3 signals were analyzed overtime at regions of interest (ROI). The equation FF0 (F-F 0)F0was used to calculate the fractional uorescence changes. F 0denotes the averagebaseline uorescence determined by the average of F over the frames of the recording before treatment. The entire leaf area was selected asROI for Ca 2signal analysis. Application of amino acids, tripeptides and chemical agents GSH, Glu-Pro-Ala, L-Glu, and sorbitol were dissolved in growth medium12  MS salts, 1 (wv) sucrose and 0.05 (wv) MES, which was thenadjusted to pH 5.1. 5 L of the solution was applied to the cut edge of leaf 1 after 30 min recovery period after pre-cutting for assessment ofsmall molecules-induced Ca 2signal transmission. In contrast, a longer recovery period of 5 h post pre-cutting was required for the assess-ment of small molecules-activated gene expression levels. GSH atconcentrations of 0.001 mM, 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM,25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM, which are within or exceeding its phy-siological concentrations, were selected for analyzing GSH-triggered systemic calcium-based defense signaling in vitro. GGsTOP (HY- 108467, MCE) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. LaCl 3was dissolved into 0.05 (vv) Silwet L-77 in water to make a 50 mM solu-tion and then 10 L was applied to a piece of Kiwmwipes placed on a petiole for at least 30 min prior to adding GSH. CRISPRCas9 vector construction and plant transformation Egg cell-speci c promoter-controlled CRISPRCas9 system was used to generate glr3.3 and glr3.6 single mutants. CRISPRCas9 vector was constructed according to previous studies44. Target sequence was selected by CRISPR-PLANT (https:www.genome.arizona.educrispr ). All the vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using electroporation. Arabidopsis plants were trans- formed using the oral dip methods. The primers used for cloning are shown in Supplementary Data 5. DNA extraction and mutation detection 15 mg frozen leaf tissues were used for DNA extraction through SDS method. The extracted genomic DNA was then used as a template toamplify the desired fragments in each of the target genes using pri-mers anking the target sites. PCR products were directly sequenced using Sanger method to identify mutation. Superimposed sequence chromatograms produced by biallelic and heterozygous mutations were decoded by DSDecode ( http:dsdecode.scgene.com )a n d manual analyses. Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR TransZol RNA kit (ET101-01, TransGen Biotech) was used to extracttotal RNA from Arabidopsis plants according to manufacturer s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA in a 20 L reaction by cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (AT311-03, TransGen Bio-tech). qRT-PCR was performed in QuantStudio 3 realtime PCR system(Applied Biosystems, USA) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Low ROX Premixed) (Q331-02, Vazyme). The 2 -Ctanalysis method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of each sample. JA and JA-Ile quanti cation in leaf tissues Metabolite extraction and quanti cation of JA and JA-Ile in leaf tissues were performed according to previously described methods using ABSciex 4500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX,MA, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) (50  2.1 mm, 1.7 m) 45.d5-JA was added to the extraction solvent (isopropanol: formic acid at 99.5: 0.5, vv) asinternal standard. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was applied innegative mode with mass transitions (precursor ionsproduct) as fol- lowed: 209.12  59.01 for JA, 322.20  130.09 for JA-Ile, and 214.15  62.03 for d 5-JA. A 10 min gradient elution program was applied for target compounds separation with 0.1 formic acid in acetonitrile(A) and pure water (B) as mobile phase with a 200 Lmin ow rate. Then, mass spectra data were processed and calculated using ABArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-57239-1 Nature Communications  (2025) 16:1915 8SCIEX analyst software (version 1.6.3, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) with calcu- lation curves made with standards. Measurement of endogenous Glu and GSH in Arabidopsis Leaf tissues were collected and directly ground into powder in liquid nitrogen. Then, 100 mg of powder was weighed accurately and trans-ferred into a 2 mL centrifuge tube. 10 L of stable isotope internal standard (5 gmL 13C2-15N-GSH, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added to each sample before extraction. Then, 1.5 mL of extractionbuffer (80 methanol with 0.1 formic acid, vv) was added, withvortexing for sample resuspension. After a 15 min centrifugation at14000  g, the supernatants were diluted 10 times, and 100 Lw a s transferred to sample vials for further detection. Target compounds were detected with a 6500 plus QTrap mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, USA) coupled with a ACQUITY UPLC H-Class system, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) probe. Extracts were separated by a synergi Hydro-RP column (2.0  100 mm,2.5m, phenomenex). A binary solvent system was used, in which mobile phase A consisted of 2 mM Triisobutylamine adjusted with5 mM acetic acid in 100 water, and mobile phase B of 100 methanol.An 8 min gradient with ow rate of 500 Lmin was used as follows: 01.0 min at 2 B; 1.0-6 min, 5 40 B; 6 7m i n ,9 8 B ;7 . 1 - 8m i n ,2 B . Column chamber and sample tray were held at 35 C and 10 C,respectively. Data were acquired in multiple reaction monitor (MRM)mode with mass transitions (precursor ionsproduct) as followed:308.1  179.1 for GSH, 147.9  83.9 for Glu and 311.0  181.9 for 13C2-15N-GSH. The nebulizer gas (Gas1), heater gas (Gas2), and curtain gas were set at 55, 55, and 35 psi, respectively. The ion spray voltagewas 4500 V in positive mode. The optimal probe temperature wasdetermined to be 500 C. Calibration curves of Glu and GSH weremade with standards, and the concentration of GSH was calculated byinternal-standard method with 13C2-15N-GSH as internal standard, while the concentration of Glu was calculated by external-standard method.The SCIEX OS software (version 1.6, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) was appliedfor metabolite identi cation and concentration calculation. Insect feeding assay with Spodoptera exigua S. exigua larvae (2ndinstar) were purchased from Jiyuan Baiyun Industry Co., Ltd (China). For feeding assays, 2ndinstar S. exigua larvae were rst underwent 24 h of starvation treatment in growth chamber and werethen gently placed on 5 week-old plants. Two S. exigua larvae were placed on a plant. Larval weights were measured 7 days after feeding.Representative S. exigua larvae recovered from corresponding plants were killed by 75 ethanol solution and photographed by stereo-microscope (SZX10, Olympus) equipped with a 0.75  objective lensand a digital camera (SC180, Olympus). Botrytis cinerea infection assay Conidiospores were collected from B. cinerea (B0510) plates and diluted to 1  106conidiosporesmL in PDB medium (Potato Dextrose Broth, BD). For drop-inoculation assay, 5 LB. cinerea spores was dropped on the center of each detached leaf. Subsequently thedetached leaves were placed in dark with high humidity for 2 3d a y s . Phenotypes were imaged with a digital camera and the lesion sizeswere measured using Digimizer software (v3.1.2.0, Belgium, Germany).For spray-inoculation assay, 4 week-old soil-grown seedlings weresprayed evenly with B. cinerea conidiospores and kept in high humidity for 2 3 days. The disease severity was classi ed into four grades: healthy (H, green), light symptoms (L, pale green), severe symptoms(S, orange-yellow), or completely dead (D, red). PDB buffer served as mock in these infection assays. As described in previous studies 4547, the assessment of B. cinerea biomass was determined by real-time PCR quanti cation of the fungal CUTINASE signal (Z69264) in relation to Arabidopsis ACTIN2 .RNA sequencing and data analysis RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Sequencinglibraries were generated using NEBNext UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) following manufacturer s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample.The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBotCluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS(Illumia) according to the manufacturer s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an IlluminaNovaseq platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Low-quality reads were removed from the raw reads using Cutadapt 48and Trimmomatic49software to get clean reads. Clean reads were mapped to the corresponding reference genome using HISAT2 software50. Gene expression levels and read count of each gene were calculated using StringTie software51. The R package DEseq2 (v1.16.1) was used to identify the differentially expressed genes based on the following cri-teria: p adj0 . 0 5 a n d  l o g 2FoldChange152.V e n nd i a g r a m m i n g ,G O enrichment analysis was performed using TBtools (v2.007)53. Structure prediction and molecular docking The ab initio structure predictions of AtGLR3.3 protein were imple-mented by RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold 2 through ColabFold 5456.T h e homology modelling of AtGLR3.3 was conducted using SWISS-MODELwith AtGLR3.4 crystallography model (7lzh) template 30,57.L i g a n dm o l 2 les of GSH and Glu were generated by Avogadro 1.2.058. Prepdock website ( https:swift.cmbi.umcn.nlservershtmlprepdock.html )a n d AutoDockTools 1.5.7 software were used for adding hydrogens andsymmetry related waters, computing Gasteiger charges, and detectingtorsion root 59. Molecular dockings were performed on AutoDock Vina 1.2.0 software and CB-DOCK2 website60,61. For AutoDock Vina, the grid box was setting up with a range spacing of 0.897 , number of points inx, y and z dimensions as 52, 54, and 70 respectively and center grid boxfor x, y and z as 173.571, 198.031, and 203.573 respectively for the ATDof AtGLR3.3.
