Abstract: Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environ- mental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (10 m diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5 CO 2conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphol- ogy, modications to extracellular mbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia difuens . The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1Tas the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.

Introduction The genus Naganishia 1 was resurrected from Cryptococcus and emended to accom- modate the albidus clade of Filobasidiales , Tremellomycetes, and Basidiomycota  24. The genus Naganishia contains the following species as legitimate in MycoBank: N. adeliensis, N. albida, N. albidosimilis, N. antarctica, N. bhutanensis, N. brisbanensis, N. cerealis, N. difuens, N. friedmannii, N. globosa, N. indica, N. liquefaciens, N. nivalis, N. onofrii, N. qatarensis, N. randhawae, N. uzbekistanensis, N. vaughanmartiniae , and N. vishniacii 24. However, the J. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165. https:doi.org10.3390jof8020165 https:www.mdpi.comjournaljofJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 2 of 23 addition of N. oricola made the list a total of 20 Naganishia species, but several of these members were yet to be validly described. In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), six yeast strains belonging to the family Tremel- lomycetes were isolated  5, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated  6. Some of the Naganishia species that were phylogenetically related to these ISS strains, which were reported to be psychrophilic or psychrotolerant species, isolated from Antarctica  4,711, also reported that the ISS Naganishia species might also display properties related to cold adaptation and an increase in radiation resistance. In addition, Naganishia species were also isolated from a variety of ecosystems, such as water  12, soil  13, tree trunk  14, air  12, Alpine glaciers 15, cheese, cereals 16, and human specimens 12. Members of the Cryptococcus species, from which Naganishia species have recently been separated, were reported to possess unique virulence factors associated with the patho- genesis  17,18. The morphological transformation of normal Cryptococcus cells into giant (Titan) cells was one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis (an inhalation acquired infection)  1921. It was also reported that titanization was unique to the Cryptococcus neo- formansC. gattii species complex, and not found in other budding basidiomycetous yeasts or in the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , when grown under similar growth conditions  21. However, occasional enlarged cells have been reported in Cryptococcus terreus . The ISS Naganishia strains exhibited Titan-like cells, a phenotype similar to the C. neoformansC. gattii species complex, when the ISS isolates were grown under simulated microgravity conditions. One of the objectives of this study was to characterize the Titan-like cells of the novel Naganishia species isolated from the ISS environment. The microscopy analyses revealed the presence of Titan-like giant cells with abnormal morphology when Naganishia species were subjected to several stressors, including a combination of hypoxic 5 CO 2and simulated ISS microgravity conditions. The second objective of this study was to utilize WGS for annotation in order to aid in the identication of genetic determinants related to cold adap- tation and radiation resistance in N. tulchinskyi . The third objective was to determine the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Naganishia strains ( n 4) using microscopy and taxonomic afliation based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, which included a seven gene concatenated (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB ,RPB1 ,RPB2 ,TEF1 ) phylogeny 2. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sample Collection and Isolation of Microorganisms During the ight experiments of Microbial Tracking-1, several surface samples ( 1 m2) were collected from various ISS environmental locations. Previous publications had de- tailed sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms from the ISS  5. Briey, internal ISS surface samples were collected using polyester wipes and then transported to Earth for processing. Samples were collected just prior to departure (within 5 days) and stored at 4C in the ISS, transported in cold packs (4C) from ISS to the Earth, hand delivered at Long Beach, California after splash down, which were then carried in ice packs (4C) during ground transportation, before storing at JPL at 4C for further processing. Total number of days for sample storage time from sample collection to processing was 7 days. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The materials associated with the sampling wipes were placed in 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) solution and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 gmL; vv), to isolate fungi  5,22. Microbial colonies grown at 25C for 7 days were picked from the media plates, puried, and stored for further analyses. Based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, six yeast strains were tentatively assigned to the genus Cryptococcus , and subsequent WGS characterization revealed that two strains were identied as Papiliotrema laurentii , while four strains belonged to a yet to be described Naganishia species  6, making this species the rst known novel eukaryote to be isolated from the ISS 6.J. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 3 of 23 2.2. Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses The WGS used for the analyses were previously generated and published  6. The WGS raw data was ltered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3  23 for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of ltered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0  24 genome assembler (k-mer size32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. Genomic DNA sequences and predicted proteomes (where available) of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from NCBI, followed by comparative analyses. 2.3. Phylogenetic Analyses Among the 20 known Naganishia species, NCBI had ITS sequences available for all the species except N. indica . The gene sequences of all available strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for the four ISS strains, which were derived from their WGS during this study. Phylogenetic analyses based on individual genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB ,RPB1 ,RPB2 ,TEF1 ) and MLST analyses (with the seven genes) were carried out with all available Naganishia species ( n 10). The individual gene sequences for all strains were rst aligned separately using ClustalW, and for MLST, seven gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually, aligned using ClusatalW, and used to generate a Maximum Likelihood Tree using MEGA 7.0.26 25. 2.4. Morphological Characterization under Simulated Microgravity Conditions 2.4.1. Growth Conditions for Phenotypic Analyses under Different Conditions Naganishia sp. IF6SW-B1Twas streaked on a Yeast extract- Peptone- Dextrose agar (1 yeast extract, 2 peptone, 2 glucose, and 1.5 agar) plate and incubated at 30C for 48 h. After 48 h of growth, colonies were resuspended in PBS, and the cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer. The cells were then inoculated at an initial density of 2105cellsmL in synthetic dextrose (SD) broth. Replicates ( n 3) of each yeast strain were grown under each condition tested. The cells were inoculated in three conditions; (a) the rst set was inoculated in 5 mL of liquid media in a tube, incubated at 30C, and shaken at 150 rpm; (b) the second set was inoculated in 5 mL liquid media and incubated on a rotating platform in a CO 2incubator (5 CO 2) at 30C; (c) the nal set was grown in 10 mL of liquid media in a high aspect ratio vessels (HARV , Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX, USA) and mounted onto a vertical rotating device (at 30 rpm) to simulate microgravity conditions, these were placed in a CO 2incubator (5 CO 2) at 30C. The CO 2level of ISS habitat is 10 more (4000 ppm) than at Earth conditions  5. Additionally, Titan cells were observed under 5 CO 2level in C. neoformans 26. Hence, morphological changes were characterized at this 5 CO 2level. The autoclavable HARVs provided oxygenation via a at, silicone rubber gas transfer membrane (Synthecon Inc.). The cultures were all incubated as described for 4 days, followed by cell pelleting for further analyses. The biochemical and physiological characterizations were characterized by employing BioLog Yeast plates, as described elsewhere  27. Briey, 4-days grown colonies in PDA plates were collected in sterile distilled water aseptically, and 106cells were transferred into the BioLog Yeast plates (BioLog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and incubated at 25C for 7 days . The change in coloration and oxidationassimilation proles of 94 different carbon sources were documented by visual examination. The clear positive and negatives were scored in 7 days incubation, and delayed reaction (weak) was documented by examining the tetrazolium violet color change after 14 days incubation. Further incubation and observation after 30 days period of time did not yield any difference in results compared to those that were observed at day 7. 2.4.2. Confocal Microscopy Yeast cell samples grown under the three conditions described above were xed in 4 paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at 4C. These cells were gently pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3500 rpm, and cells were rinsed 3 with sterile PBS. SubsequentJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 4 of 23 processing steps were carried out in the dark, where samples were covered with aluminum foil and protected from the light. Cell pellets were resuspended in 15 M Calcouor White and incubated for 1 h at 37C. Samples were then rinsed and pelleted as previously mentioned but with distilled H 2O. After the third rinse, samples were pelleted again, and the pellet was resuspended with 1 M TO-PRO-3 (Fisher Scientic, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were further rinsed and pelleted, as previously mentioned, using distilled H 2O. The resuspended samples were ltered through a 0.2 M 25 mm Isopore Membrane Filter (GTBP) using a lter manifold. This membrane was removed, placed on a microscope slide, and a drop of antifade was added to the top. A coverslip was placed, and then, the edges were sealed. The samples were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 880 upright laser scanning confocal microscope and an Alpha Plan-APOCHROMAT 63 lens (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Yeast cell size and cell wall thickness were analyzed using ImageJ 28. 2.4.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy Yeast cells grown under various conditions were preserved using 4 paraformalde- hyde (PFA) in PBS for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Following the concentration, cells were immersed in a chilled 4 PFA and incubated at 4C for 10 min before the PFA was removed and washed in PBS buffer. Fixed cells were transferred into a 24-well plate, dehydrated in an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) series (50 to 100), and stored at 4C. Samples were critically point dried in an Au- tomegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD, USA). Samples were attached to SEM stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA), followed by carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to a thickness of 12 nm. SEM analysis was performed with an FEI Quanta 200F (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.4.4. Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM was performed to examine cell wall thickness variations and analyze organelles differences between the different environmental stressors (CO 2and simulated microgravity) induced Titan-like cells and standard cells, grown under Earth gravity, with 5 CO 2and without CO 2. For TEM, yeast cells were xed in 2 glutaraldehyde for at least one hour at 4C. Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and immersed in 1 osmium tetroxide with 1.6 potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After rinsing, samples were polymerized at 60C for 2448 h in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and used. Thin sections (70 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. The grids were post-stained with 2 uranyl acetate, followed by Reynolds lead citrate. The sections were imaged using a Tecnai 12 120 kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data were recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). 2.4.5. Statistical Analyses All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.1.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Specically, data was tested for normal distribution with the DAgostino and Pearson normality test, followed by non-parametric ANOVA using a post-hoc KruskalWallis analysis. 2.5. Survey of Genes and Proteins Involved in Resistance Genes and proteins involved in cold resistance from the closely related species N. vishniacii 29 were screened using tBLASTn and BLASTp (Table 1). Cold tolerance included genes involved in carotenoid synthesis: isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, farnesyltrans- ferase, farnesyl pyrophosphatase synthetase, phytoene-beta carotene synthase, NADP- cytochrome P450 reductase; genes involved in mycosporine synthesis: 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase, catechol o-methyltransferase, and carbamoylphosphate synthase reported inJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 5 of 23 Phafa rhodozyma 30; enzymes involved in the formation and degradation of trehalose: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase component TPS1 and TPS2, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, NTH1, and ATH1. Additionally, resistance related proteins for fungi were screened using sequences obtained from NCBI by using microgravity and radioresistance keywords. Microgravity-related proteins included: Daughter-specic expression protein 1 and 2, GPI- anchored protein 24, Chain A Flocculation protein FLO1, Chain A and B Flocculin, and Chain A proteinase K. Radioresistance proteins including sequences from the DNA repair protein rad9. 2.6. De Novo Genome Annotation Gene annotation on each of the six assemblies (four Naganishia tuchinskyi strains and two closely related species) was performed using MAKER  31. MAKER identied repeats, aligned expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and proteins to a genome, and produced ab initio gene predictions. A total of 74,830 available ESTs from closely related Naganishia species were downloaded from NCBI (Table 2) and protein sequences from six strains were downloaded from UniProt 32. Firstly, de novo repeat identication and masking were performed using RepeatMod- eler  33. Then, MAKER control les were generated (maker-CTL), and a rst-round was run using the maker_opts.ctl control le. Data for the transcriptome assembly (EST), pro- tein sequences (protein), and repeat annotations (rm_gff) was provided. Additionally, the model_org was set to simple to annotate simple repeats, and inference predictions of genes directly from ESTs and protein homology were set (est2genome  1, protein2genome  1 ). Lastly, GFF and FASTA outputs were assembled together with GFF3toolkit 34. Next, we predicted genes using the gene models generated with MAKER by training SNAP  35 and Augustus  36 using BUSCO  37. For SNAP , we used models with an AED of 0.25 or better and a length of 50 or more amino acids. To train Augustus, we excised regions that contain mRNA annotations based on our initial MAKER run, with 1000 bp on each side, as described 38. To run BUSCO, the Eukaryota set of conserved genes was used. The -m genome option was specied to provide regions that included more than just transcripts. The initial HMM model selected was Cryptococcus , which corresponded to the closest genus ofNaganishia (augustus_species  cryptococcus). The long option was set to optimize self-training Augustus. Following the BUSCO run, the second round of MAKER was performed using the SNAP and Augustus models. For this purpose, FASTA sequence les were replaced with GFF les (est_gff, protein_gff, and rm_gff), and est2genome and protein2genome were switched to 0. The third run of MAKER was performed, and the gene models were evaluated by counting the number of gene models and the gene lengths after each round and running BUSCO using the transcript sequences (-m transcriptome).J.

Data Availability The WGS and raw data have been deposited in GenBank under the BioProject accession number PRJNA623412  6. The genome sequences have also been deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GeneLab system (GLDS-290; https: genelab-data.ndc.nasa.govgenelabaccessionGLDS-290; accessed on 5 December 2021). In addition to the WGS, we performed amplicon sequencing the ITS region from each strain  5, and their accession numbers are given below. Naganishia IF6SW-B1 (KY218715.1); Naganishia IF1SW-F1 (KY218664.1); Naganishia IF7SW-B1 (KY218717.1); Naganishia IIF5SW- F1 (KY218695.1). 3. Results and Discussion Several yeast strains belonging to the Naganishia (Cryptococcus )difuens clade of Filoba- sidiales were isolated from two different ight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS  5. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identied to be novel species belonging to the genus Naganishia, based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations 1, 2, and 3), Node 1 (Locations 4 and 5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location 6), U.S. Laboratory (Location 7), and Node 2 (Locations 8 and control). A detailed description of the various locations sampled was published elsewhere  59. Strains IF6SW-B1, IF7SW-B1, and IF1SW-F1, were isolated during rstJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 8 of 23 sampling from Locations 6, 7, and 1, respectively. Strain IIF5SW-F1 was isolated from second sampling at Location 5. 3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains To conrm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic aflia- tions were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Naganishia . The MycoBank database documented 19 Naganishia species, and the CBS database showed only 11 Nagan- ishia species. The gene sequences available on NCBI for Naganishia species ( n 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees with C. neoformans CBS 132 strain as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II ( RPB1 and RPB2 ), translation elongation factor 1- (TEF1 ), and cytochrome b (CYTB ), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species  2. The respective gene sequences that were available on NCBI for different Naganishia species were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members from Tremellomycetes (Goffeauzyma gastricus CBS 2288 (AF145323.1), Heterocephalacria arrabidensis CBS 8678 (AF444362.2), Piskurozyma cylindrica CBS 8680 (AF444360.1), Solicoccozyma aerius CBS155 (AF145324.1), and Tremella mesenterica CBS 6973 (AF444433.1)) were included with Cryptococcus neoformans CBS 132 (AF444326.1) as the outgroup. Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB ,RPB1 ,RPB2 , and TEF1 genes were generated and are presented in Supplemental Figures S1S7. When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no signicant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences (Figure S3), whereas the other four genes ( CYTB ,RPB1 ,RPB2 , and TEF1 ) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all the Naganishia species. The ITS tree (Supplemental Figure S1) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species, N. difuens, N. liquefaciens and N. albidosimilis . ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100 similarity to the sequence of N. albidosimilis CBS 7711T(AF145325), N. liquefaciens CBS 968T(AF444345), and N. difuens CBS 160T (AF145330). However, ITS sequences of N. vishniacii CBS 7110Tshared 97.84 similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145320.), N. uzbekistanensis CBS 8683Thad 97.55 similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF444339), and N. adeliensis CBS 8351Texhibited 97.34 similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145328) with ISS isolates (Supplemental Figure S1). In the LSU tree ( Supplemental Figure S2 ), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished from N. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii , and N. albidosimilis with low bootstrap support. Com- paring the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71 similarity to N. albida (type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075474), 96.41 similarity to N. albidosimilis (type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF137601), 96.25 similarly to N. liquefaciens (type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF181515), and 95.92 similarity to N. difuens (type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075502) (Supplemental Figure S2). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51 in the LSU region and 99.21 in the ITS region  1. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates conrm they belong to a new species in the genus Naganishia (order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree (Supplemental Figure S3) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species. The other phylogenetic trees based on CYTB ,RPB1 ,RPB2 , and TEF1 grouped the ISS strains together, and the closest neighbor was identied as N. difuens . Subsequently, MLST was carried out by manually concatenating the seven genes (Figure 1). The MLST phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the sameJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 9 of 23 clade with N. difuens CBS 160T(Figure 1). The individual gene-based and MLST tree-based analyses both further supported the nding that the four ISS strains belong to the same species which is closely related to, but separate from, N. difuens . This suggested that the four ISS strains were novel species of the genus Naganishia . All four strains were isolated during different ights and sampling sessions at various locations, suggesting that these isolates are not clonal but persisting in the ISS environment.

Figure 2B shows the cell size in diameter ( m) under various growth conditions, whereas Figure 2C depicts the cell wall thickness. The size of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity conditions and in the presence of 5 CO 2with standard Earth gravity ranged from 2.5m to 6 m; however, the cells grown under 5 CO 2were statistically signicantly larger ( p0.05).

The budding scars under simulated microgravity conditions range in morphology and size from 23 m raised prominences extending 12 m from the cell surface to large at raised rings up to 5m in diameter (Figure 3C,D).

This phenomenon is highlighted with the white arrow ( D). Representative SEM micrographs are given, and scale bar for all micrographs is 10 m.

Indeed, a large majority of the disgurement and abnormal cell morphology appeared to be associated with the surface location where daughter cell replication occurred (Figures 3C,D and S8AC). Further analyses of TEM images empha- sized the differences between the growth conditions, with G grown cells showing large structural alterations within the intracellular space, having thicker cell walls, and a decrease in the amount of surface-associated mbria (Figure 4E,F).

The scale bar for ( A,C,E) is 1 m, and the scale bare for ( B,D,F) is 0.2 m. Additionally, the G grown cells showed irregular intracellular organization with what appears to be large unknown membrane bound compartmentsstructures (Figure 4E). The function and content of these structures is still unclear, and it is currently unknown if these are vacuole or lysome-like vacuoles (Figure 4E)  62. Previous reports have shown that some yeast can produce large numbers of compounds that are subsequently stored in vacuoles, while other yeast can utilize these large storage vesicles to degrade a large variety of substances  62,63. Increased vacuole size could suggest a larger assortment and or quantity of nutrients being degraded by the Titan-like cells than by the standard gravity grown cells. Additionally, research has shown that portions of vacuoles can be passed to daughter cells  64. Thus, it is possible that simulated microgravity inducedJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 13 of 23 compounds contained in the vacuoles may be passed to their progeny. Much further work is needed to better identify novel structures within the Titan-like cells, categorize the specic modications that are occurring to organelles within the cells, determine how each of the cellular modications alters the cells survivability in extreme environments (pH ranges, temperature ranges, osmotic shock, radiation exposure, etc.), and determine if these traits are passed on to their progeny. Cryptococcus species have been shown to produce enlarged Titan-like cells to adapt to stress and contribute to Cryptococcus pathogenesis  20,65. Both functions may also be of relevance for these ISS strains. The polyploidy nature of the yeast cells should be investigated as this might shed insights into the adaptation of these cells to microgravity conditions. Even though confocal microscopy measurements and increased uorescence content in the microgravity-grown cells were documented, analysis of the nucleic acid reads of heterozygous regions of the genomes and a comparison of the ratios for the various alleles is needed to conrm the polyploidy nature of these cells. It is documented in C. neoformans that the enlarged polyploid Titan-like cells were able to generate progeny with aneuploidy. It was additionally found that the progeny of these Titan-like cells have both growth and survival advantages over typical cell progeny under stressful conditions  20. Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1Tyeast to space conditions 20. While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of the C. neoformansC. gattii species complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISS Naganishia species is novel. Understanding how microgravity inuences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence in Naganishia species and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aide Cryptococcus cells evade the immune system  21,26,6567. By growing from the normal range of 1 to 3 m in diameter to 10m, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progenys increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to conrm this aspect. 3.3. Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain Using BLAST, genes in ISS Naganishia species were compared to known genes that conferred resistance to cold, microgravity, and radiation (Table 1), as well as pigment biosynthesis. The reference genes were a compilation of NCBI queries and previously reported genes related to the spaceight-related characteristics (Table 1). In addition to our four N. tulchinskyi strains, N. vishniacii (Antarctica strain), Papiliotrema laurentii (ISS isolates), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (space own strain) were included for comparison. A total of 24 genes aligned to one or more of the assemblies. Genes related to pigment synthesis and radioresistance were among the most prevalent, while genes associated with microgravity were mostly exclusive of S. cerevisiae . Proteome prediction was performed with MAKER to determine biotechnologically im- portant genetic elements in the four novel Naganishia strains  31. Protein-coding genes were then assigned gene ontologies (GO) using InterProScan  68 (Figure 5) and passed through REVIGO  58 to summarize GO assignments and remove redundant terms ( Figure S1 ). In total, 4894 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled draft genomes, which comprised 128 scaffolds (Supplemental Table S1). A total of 86, 47, and 89 top ontological hits were assigned, respectively, for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function (Table S1), ranked by ontological uniqueness of term with respectJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 14 of 23 to all other terms cataloged in UniProt. Top Biological Processes include cell morphogen- esis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, reecting a repertoire that was suited to respond to microgravity and radiation (Figures 5 and S2). The extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were top cellular component results, implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the top molecular function hits included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Changing these molecular mechanisms can alter the shape of cells, and in fungi, morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli have been reported and mostly attributed to pathogenesis  20,69. The highest ontological hits revealed the presence of protein coding genes that might provide insights into the underlying origins of Titan-like cells in N. tulchinskyi . However, more studies are necessary to depict the mechanisms and role of titanization in microgravity. The ability of Naganishia species to grow at low temperatures  29 and withstand high doses of UV radiation in extreme environments  1 has led to the ongoing microbial characterization of this genus; however, there are currently only a few genomes publicly available 70,71. Unlike the S. cerevisiae genome, which has been extensively studied 72, the genomic characterization of the Naganishia clade is still in its infancy. The presence of reported genes related to cold resistance  39, radiation tolerance  47, and microgravity (Table 1) in ISS strains might indicate the potential of the novel N. tulchinskyi to better withstand the ISS or spaceight-related conditions. However, only a few genes associated with microgravity have been identied  73,74. It has been reported that the RAD51 , RAD54 , and RDH54 genes seen in ISS strains also play critical roles in C. neoformans to repair gamma-radiation induced DNA damage 47. Additionally, high carotenoid concentration has been correlated with an increased resistance of the cells against freeze damage, environmental stress, and radiation pro- tection  75,76, all of which are notable features of the extremophile Deinococcus radiodu- rans 77,78. Biomolecules responsible for the pigment biosynthesis, such as geranylger- anyl diphosphate synthase, cytochrome P450 reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, and NTH1, pu- tative trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps2 were present in all strains of Naganishia and S. cerevisiae (Table 1). It has been well documented that carotenoids can efciently protect the skin from UV-light induced damages, scavenging singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals  79. The microbiological synthesis of carotenoids, signicance, and biotechnological relevance were extensively reviewed  80. The phytoene-beta carotene synthase ( pbs) was present only in ISS strains but not found in S. cerevisiae. More research is needed here since biosynthesis of tetraterpenoids and pbsinvolvement in microorganisms is still poorly understood 81. 3.4. Taxonomy Novel species: Naganishia tulchinskyi, N. K.

Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 16 of 23 Description : In PDA medium after 5 days at 25C, the cells are round, ovoid to ellipsoidal, 4.1 0.97 m and occur singly with polar budding. When grown under simulated microgravity at 30C, cells are 3 times larger and formed Titan-like cells (Figure 2). After incubation at 25C, the streak culture on PDA agar is butyrous and cream colored, with a smooth surface and an entire margin. Growth occurs at 4, 25, and 30C and not at 35C on nutrient medium. Biochemical characteristics: Differential biochemical characteristics of N. tulchinskyi with other closely related Naganishia species are shown in Table 3. N. tulchinskyi strains are able to assimilate D-Arabinose, D-Ribose, L-Sorbose, D-Mannitol, -D-Glucose, L- Arabinose, Salicin, D-Trehalose, Maltose, D-Xylose, Sucrose, D-Cellobiose, Succinic Acid Mono-Methyl Ester, D-Xylose, and Palatinose as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells did not utilize Cellobiose, Arbutin, D-Galactose, Glycerol, Hexadecane, L-Malic acid, L- Rhamnose, Lactose, Mannitol, Melezitose, Methyl a-glucoside, Myo-inositol, Rafnose, Xylitol, Citrate, Melibiose, Meso erythritol, Glucono D-lactone, Inulin, and N-acetyl D- glucosamine as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells assimilate D-arabinose and can be differentiated from N. friedmannii, N. saitoi, N. globosa. Similarly, several carbon substrates are differentially utilized by N. tulchinskyi and are detailed in Table 3. EcologySubstrateHost : Distinct Naganishia yeast colonies ( n 4) were isolated over two separate sample collection ights from three different locations. The type strain IF6SW-B1Tand two other strains (IF7SW-B1 and IF1SW-F1) were isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015 ), while the fourth strain (IIF5SW-F1) was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015). Strain IF6SW-B1Twas isolated from a rack that contained crew clothes, crew preference items, ofce supplies, and ISS medical accessory kits (Location 6, Permanent Multipurpose Module Port 1). The second strain IF7SW-B1 was isolated from a rack being used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS (Location 7, Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1). The third strain IF1SW-F1 was isolated from a viewing port in a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activi- ties (Location 1, Port panel of the Cupola). The fourth strain IIF5SW-F1 was the only strain in this study isolated during Flight 2, and it was cultivated from a storage rack made up of Nomex fabrics and used as a pantry to store batteries, printer cartridges, ofce supplies, etc. (Location 5, Overhead-4, Node 1, US module). Distribution : This novel species has yet to be found in any samples from other Earth environments. Material examined : The particulate matter associated with 1 m2surface area of the ISS environmental surfaces was examined.J. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 17 of 23 Table 3.

Conclusions In summary, a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi , was isolated from the ISS environmental surfaces that produced giant Titan-like cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Morphological characterization of N. tulchinskyi cells revealed that the cell wall is thicker under simulated microgravity and might help them withstand such unfavorable conditions, and these simulated microgravity-grown cells demonstrate a novel bud scar shedding trait. The phylogenetic analyses using the MLST approach showed that these are novel yeast. Further genomic characterization revealed genes responsible for cell morphogenesis and UVC resistance, reecting a range of molecular mechanisms suited to respond to microgravity and radiation.

SEM (A-C) and TEM (D-G) micrographs highlighting the unusual G grown Titan-like cell morphology. Titan-like cells show large concave and convex budding scars (A-C). A daughter cell can be seen budding from the mother yeast cell (black arrow), and appears to be altering the shape of the mother cells cell wall (B). Budding scars are shown to be peeling off of the yeast surfaces (white arrows) (A-C). This phenomenon is shown in TEM images, designated by white arrows (D-G). SEM scale bars are 10 m. TEM scale bars are 5 m (D), 1 m (E-F), and 0.5 m (G). The letter N distinguishes the nucleus (B, C, and E). Table S1. Reducing all protein-coding gene products from the predicted proteome of the novel type strain IF6SW-B1T to their most distinct Gene Ontology (GO) terms for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function. Frequency indicates the number of genes in UniProt associated with this term. Uniqueness is a measurement of average similarity of a term to all other GO terms, while dispensability measures the semantic distance between a term and all other GO terms.

        "introduction": "The genus Naganishia 1 was resurrected from Cryptococcus and emended to accom- modate the albidus clade of Filobasidiales , Tremellomycetes, and Basidiomycota  24. The genus Naganishia contains the following species as legitimate in MycoBank: N. adeliensis, N. albida, N. albidosimilis, N. antarctica, N. bhutanensis, N. brisbanensis, N. cerealis, N. difuens, N. friedmannii, N. globosa, N. indica, N. liquefaciens, N. nivalis, N. onofrii, N. qatarensis, N. randhawae, N. uzbekistanensis, N. vaughanmartiniae , and N. vishniacii 24. However, the J. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165. https:doi.org10.3390jof8020165 https:www.mdpi.comjournaljofJ. Fungi 2022 ,8, 165 2 of 23 addition of N. oricola made the list a total of 20 Naganishia species, but several of these members were yet to be validly described. In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), six yeast strains belonging to the family Tremel- lomycetes were isolated  5, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated  6. Some of the Naganishia species that were phylogenetically related to these ISS strains, which were reported to be psychrophilic or psychrotolerant species, isolated from Antarctica  4,711, also reported that the ISS Naganishia species might also display properties related to cold adaptation and an increase in radiation resistance. In addition, Naganishia species were also isolated from a variety of ecosystems, such as water  12, soil  13, tree trunk  14, air  12, Alpine glaciers 15, cheese, cereals 16, and human specimens 12. Members of the Cryptococcus species, from which Naganishia species have recently been separated, were reported to possess unique virulence factors associated with the patho- genesis  17,18. The morphological transformation of normal Cryptococcus cells into giant (Titan) cells was one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis (an inhalation acquired infection)  1921. It was also reported that titanization was unique to the Cryptococcus neo- formansC. gattii species complex, and not found in other budding basidiomycetous yeasts or in the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , when grown under similar growth conditions  21. However, occasional enlarged cells have been reported in Cryptococcus terreus . The ISS Naganishia strains exhibited Titan-like cells, a phenotype similar to the C. neoformansC. gattii species complex, when the ISS isolates were grown under simulated microgravity conditions. One of the objectives of this study was to characterize the Titan-like cells of the novel Naganishia species isolated from the ISS environment. The microscopy analyses revealed the presence of Titan-like giant cells with abnormal morphology when Naganishia species were subjected to several stressors, including a combination of hypoxic 5 CO 2and simulated ISS microgravity conditions. The second objective of this study was to utilize WGS for annotation in order to aid in the identication of genetic determinants related to cold adap- tation and radiation resistance in N. tulchinskyi . The third objective was to determine the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Naganishia strains ( n 4) using microscopy and taxonomic afliation based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, which included a seven gene concatenated (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB ,RPB1 ,RPB2 ,TEF1 ) phylogeny 2. 2.

        "conclusion": "s In summary, a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi , was isolated from the ISS environmental surfaces that produced giant Titan-like cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Morphological characterization of N. tulchinskyi cells revealed that the cell wall is thicker under simulated microgravity and might help them withstand such unfavorable conditions, and these simulated microgravity-grown cells demonstrate a novel bud scar shedding trait. The phylogenetic analyses using the MLST approach showed that these are novel yeast. Further genomic characterization revealed genes responsible for cell morphogenesis and UVC resistance, reecting a range of molecular mechanisms suited to respond to microgravity and radiation.
