Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., From ISS INTRODUCTION The genus Methylobacterium contains more species than any other genera within the family Methylobacteriaceae , order Rhizobiales , and class Alphaproteobacteria (Kelly et al., 2014). Methylobacterium species are Gram-negative, rod- shaped bacteria. The genus was rst proposed by Patt et al. (1976) with Methylobacterium organophilum as the type species. The genus Methylobacterium was rst emended to include facultative methylotrophs that have the ability to grow on methane or methanol as the source of carbon and energy, in addition to sugars and organic acids (Patt et al., 1976). Another taxonomic study classied all other previously known pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria under the genus Methylobacterium (Green and Bouseld, 1982). Thereafter, 11 species from the genus Methylobacterium were redened into a new genus proposed as Methylorubrum , based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), genomic, and phenotypic data (Green and Ardley, 2018). The genus Methylobacterium consists of 45 recognized species, which are ubiquitously present in a wide variety of habitats including air, soil, freshwater, and sediments, and can exist either in free-form or associated with plant tissues (Gallego et al., 2005a,b; Kang et al., 2007; Veyisoglu et al., 2013; Kelly et al., 2014; Kwak et al., 2014; Chaudhry et al., 2016; Green and Ardley, 2018; Park et al., 2018). Methylobacterium species are involved in nitrogen xation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens (Madhaiyan et al., 2006; Kumar M. et al., 2016; Parasuraman et al., 2019; Grossi et al., 2020; Krug et al., 2020). For instance, a novel Methylobacterium sp. 2A was observed to result in higher density of lateral roots in inoculated potato crops, even under salt stress conditions, compared with control plants that were not inoculated with the bacteria; it was also found to exhibit biocontrol activity against several plant pathogens (Grossi et al., 2020). Furthermore, genomic analysis of Methylobacterium sp. 2A revealed the presence of metabolic pathways involved in plant growth promotion, including the genes for producing an auxin, 3-indole acetic acid (Grossi et al., 2020). In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae were isolated (Checinska Siela et al., 2019). Some of the Methylobacterium species that are phylogenetically related to these ISS strains have been isolated from plant sources (Kang et al., 2007; Chaudhry et al., 2016), indicating that the ISS strains might also display properties related to plant growth promotion. The objectives of this study were to generate whole genome sequences (WGS) and dene the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Methylobacterium strains using polyphasic taxonomic analyses. The WGS generated and annotated in this study was used to predict biotechnologically useful genetic determinants.MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Collection and Isolation of Bacteria Several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from the ISS during Microbial Tracking1 ight experiments from 2015 to 2016. Sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms were published elsewhere (Checinska Siela et al., 2019). Briey, the polyester wipes used to collect samples and particulates associated with the sampling devices were transported to Earth before being disassociated into sterile phosphate-buered saline (pH 7.4) solution and plated onto R2A agar medium (Checinska et al., 2015; Checinska Siela et al., 2019). The microbial cultures that were grown at 25C for 7 days were picked from the R2A plates, puried, and stored for further analyses. Distinct colonies ( n 4) isolated from three dierent locations and from a high-eciency particulate arrestance (HEPA) lter were characterized during this study. These colonies exhibited unique coloration and dierential genomic phylogeny. The type strain IF7SW-B2Twas isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015) at Location 7, the Overhead- 3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. The second strain, IIF1SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location 1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. The third strain, IIF4SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location 4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crewmembers also used the table for experimental work. The fourth strain was I1- R3, isolated from the ISS HEPA lter that was returned aboard STS-134ULF6 in May 2011 and archived as reported earlier (Checinska et al., 2015). DNA Extraction and Whole Genome Sequencing Analysis A biomass of approximately 1 mg wet weight was collected for DNA extraction from each strain after growing on R2A medium at 25C for 3 days. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, United States) after bead beating with a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantied, and 5 to 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplication were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplied genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384-plex conguration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 owcell PE 2150 platform with a paired-end module. The data were ltered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain, 2012) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome Frontiers in Microbiology  www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2021  Volume 12  Article 639396fmicb-12-639396 March 12, 2021 Time: 20:27  3 Bijlani et al. Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., From ISS assembly (cuto read length for HQ, 80; cuto quality score, 20). The number of ltered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) genome assembler ( k- mer size- 32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. The genome was annotated using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 4.11 (Tatusova et al., 2016; Haft et al., 2018). In addition, functional annotation of genome and seed categories were assigned to the genome by implementing the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) tool (Aziz et al., 2008). Genomes of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from NCBI, and the genomic relatedness of ISS strains was identied based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; FastANI) calculations (Jain et al., 2018) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis (Meier-Koltho et al., 2013). FastANI was run on all the genomes using the default parameters: Mashmap identity cuto I0 80, non-overlapping fragments of sizel3Kb, and minimum count of reciprocal mappings t 50. Phylogenetic Analysis Phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and MLSA using six housekeeping genes: ATP synthase F1 beta subunit ( atpD ), DNA strand exchange and recombination gene ( recA ), chaperone gene ( dnaK ), DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta ( rpoB ), glutamine synthetase type I ( glnI), and DNA gyrase subunit B ( gyrB ), for dierentiating Methylobacterium species (Green and Ardley, 2018). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains of all 45 Methylobacterium species were included in the phylogenetic analysis. In addition, representative species of genus Methylorubrum ,Enterovirga ,Microvirga , and Neomegalonema from family Methylobacteriaceae ,Rhizobium from order Rhizobiales ,Caulobacter from order Caulobacterales , in class Alphaproteobacteria were included. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was selected as the outgroup. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all strains were retrieved from NCBI except for the four ISS strains, which were recovered from their respective WGS. Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping genes and MLSA was carried out with type strains of 24 Methylobacterium species and representative species of other genera. All the gene sequences were retrieved from the genome sequences using RAST v2.01(Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014; Brettin et al., 2015). The individual gene sequences for all strains were aligned separately using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). For MLSA, six housekeeping gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually and aligned using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). The genome-based tree for the Methylobacterium species, including ISS strains and representative species of other genus with available WGS, was constructed using GToTree (Lee, 2019). This tool takes the completedraft genomes as input and creates a phylogenomic tree based on the prespecied single-copy gene 1https:rast.nmpdr.orgset using a hidden Markov model (HMM); the tool currently has 2,044 unique HMM set as identiers to cover all three domains of microbial life. Phenotypic Characterization of ISS Strains Phenotypic characterization was performed according to standard protocols (Jones, 1981). Growth of the ISS strains at dierent temperatures (7, 25, 30, 37, and 45C) was assessed after incubation on nutrient agar (Sigma, United States) for 7 days. Growth at dierent pH (4.010.0 at intervals of 1.0) was assessed after incubation in nutrient broth (Sigma, United States) at 30C for 7 days. The pH of the nutrient medium was adjusted using citrateNaH 2PO 4buer (pH 4.05.0), phosphate buer (pH 6.08.0), and tris buer (pH 9.010.0) (Kim et al., 2019). Salt tolerance was tested by streaking the strains on R2A supplemented with NaCl (010 at intervals of 1) and incubating the plates at 30C for 7 days. Motility was assessed via the hanging drop method by observing the culture under a light microscope (Tindall et al., 2007). Catalase activity was tested by adding 3 hydrogen peroxide to culture grown on R2A at 30C for 7 days, and eervescence was monitored (Tindall et al., 2007). An oxidase test was carried out in a lter paper soaked with the substrate tetramethyl- p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and coloration was documented (JurtshukJr., and McQuitty, 1976). All other physiological and biochemical tests were carried out using API 20 NE, API 50 CH, and API ZYM kits as per manufacturers procedures (bioMrieux, France). Chemotaxonomic Analysis All strains grown in the R2A broth were harvested when growth of the cultures reached around 70 of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase), and then the cultures were used for analyses of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which were carried out as described previously (Ramaprasad et al., 2015). Briey, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cell pellet from each strain was subjected to a series of four dierent reagents followed by saponication and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) thus obtained were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with Sherlock MIS software (Microbial ID; MIDI 6.0 version; Agilent: 6850)2. The peaks obtained were then labeled, and the equivalent chain length (ECL) values were computed by the Sherlock software. The polar lipids prole was analyzed by extracting cells with methanol-chloroform-saline (2:1:0.8, vvv) from 1 g of freeze-dried bacterial cells. Separation of lipids was performed by two-dimensional chromatography on a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate (Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck) using chloroform-methanol-water (75:32:4, vvv) in the rst dimension and chloroformmethanol acetic acidwater (86:16:15:4, vvvv) in the second dimension. The total polar lipids prole was detected by spraying with 6 ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid. 2http:midi-inc.com Frontiers in Microbiology  www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2021  Volume 12  Article 639396fmicb-12-639396 March 12, 2021 Time: 20:27  4 Bijlani et al.

In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually ( Figure 3 ). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated ( Figure 4 ). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) are clustered together and in the same clade with M. indicum SE2.11T. The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing, housekeeping gene-based analyses, MLSA, and genome-based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related to M. indicum .In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1-R3 was further conrmed to be M. rhodesianum based on its 16S rRNA gene (Figure 1 ) and gyrB (Figure 2 ) phylogenetic aliation to the type strain M. rhodesianum DSM 5687T. Whole Genome SequenceBased Phylogenetic Analysis The genomes of the four isolated ISS strains were sequenced, with their draft genome assembled and annotated. The results are summarized in Table 1 . The genome varied in size from 6.1 to Frontiers in Microbiology  www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2021  Volume 12  Article 639396fmicb-12-639396 March 12, 2021 Time: 20:27  7 Bijlani et al. Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., From ISS FIGURE 4  Genome-based phylogenetic tree showing the phylogenetic relationship of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. with members of the family Methylobacteriaceae . 6.8 Mbp with GC content between 68 and 71, similar to other members of the family Methylobacteriaceae . Due to higher sequence similarities of three ISS strains with M. indicum SE2.11T(99.4 for 16S rRNA gene and 97.3 for gyrB gene), the draft genomes of three ISS strains were subjected to ANI and dDDH analysis with other species belonging to family Methylobacteriaceae (Table 2 ). The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) with M. indicum SE2.11Twere 92.7 to 93, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other Methylobacterium species were below the threshold of 95 ANI (Yoon et al., 2017) and 70 dDDH values (Auch et al., 2010), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus Methylobacterium . These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99100 with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, M. indicum SE2.11T, and M. platani PMB02T were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity usingthe MUMmer 3.0 system (Kurtz et al., 2004). As shown in Supplementary Figure 6 , genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of M. indicum and M. platani exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW- B2T. Since these three ISS strains were isolated at dierent time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological signicance in the closed systems warrant further study. The fourth strain I1-R3 was identied as M. rhodesianum based on highly similar 16S rRNA (99.9), gyrB (100), ANI (98.9), and dDDH (91.6) genomic parameters with M. rhodesianum DSM 5687T. The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also dierent from the novel ISS Methylobacterium strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains were82 and 24, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses conrmed the phylogenetic aliation of strain I1-R3 as M. rhodesianum . In this communication, phylogenetic aliations of only IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented.

Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., From ISS Phenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 2 . The dierential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW- B5, and IIF4SW-B5 are listed in Table 3 , in comparison with other related Methylobacterium species. Three strains belonging toMethylobacterium sp. nov. are reddish pinkpigmented, Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile, and rod-shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30C, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45C. These strains were positive for assimilation of L-arabinose, D-glucose, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in Supplementary Tables 3-5 , respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other Methylobacterium species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were dierent from the closest genomic relative M. indicum in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike M. indicum , these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other Methylobacterium species, M. aquaticum and M. terrae exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production proles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by M. aquaticum . Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by M. terrae cells. The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus Methylobacterium , with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation (Green and Bouseld, 1982). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS Methylobacterium strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus Methylobacterium . Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other Methylobacterium species. However, the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains diered from other members of the genus Methylobacterium in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown inTable 3 . For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the Methylobacterium species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related Methylobacterium species. Chemotaxonomic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The FAME proling of three ISS strains and other related Methylobacterium species are given in Table 4 .

However, complete FAME proles were not consistent among Methylobacterium species and some signicant dierences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed ( Table 4 ). The notable dierence in the FAME prole was the lower abundance of C18V17cinM. indicum (46) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85). These ISS strains contained Q-10 as the major respiratory isoprenoid quinone, which is common in members of the genus Methylobacterium . The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentied lipid (Supplementary Figure 7 ). The total polar lipid prole of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with theresults of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the aliation of strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 to the genus Methylobacterium . Functional Characteristics of the Novel ISS Strain The genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T, type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described in Table 5 . All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented in Supplementary Data 1 . A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) ( Table 5 ).

All strains exhibited 0-1 NaCl tolerance and were motile. Growth was tested at 7, 25, 30, 37, and 45C and cells were grown optimally at 25 and 30C but no growth was observed at 7, 37, and 45C. Growth lower than 25C might be possible but not tested. (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed. Based on the genome annotation, genes for nitrogen metabolism were predicted in the genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T. Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria (Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high-anity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identied in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T(Wanner, 1993, 1996). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW- B2Twhen compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; Methylobacterium sp. IF7SW-B2Texhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identied in Solibacillus kalamii (Seuylemezian et al., 2017) and 18 features were identied in Kalamiella piersonii (Singh et al., 2019). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions (Orsini et al., 2017; Aunins et al., 2018). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identication of geneticdeterminants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self-sustainable plant crops for long-term space missions in future. Genes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain A thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T revealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase (miaA ) essential for cytokinin production reported in M. aquaticum strain 22A (Tani et al., 2015) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2Twith high similarity. The product of the miaA gene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specic adenine in some tRNAs and conrmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA in M. extorquens (Koenig et al., 2002).

(EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identied in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T. The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented ( Supplementary Figure 8 ). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that Methylobacterium strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth (Krug et al., 2020). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple agellar proteins, were identied in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2Tand are listed in the Supplementary Figure 8 . Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benet from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in Methylobacterium spp. (Krug et al., 2020). In the carbon for iron mutualism concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria (Amin et al., 2015). Similar studies are warranted to conrm the plant-growth promoting activities in the IF7SW-B2TISS strain.In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and dierential phenotypic properties were sucient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized Methylobacterium species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW- B5 represent a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium , for which the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T(NRRL B-65601Tand LMG 32165T). Description of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii (aj.mali.i. N.L. gen. n. ajmalii named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase- and catalase-positive reactions. Cells are 1.61.8 mm wide and 2.23.2 mm long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pinkpigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.61.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar. Growth occurs at 2530C (optimum, 30C), at pH 6.08.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 01.0 (wv) NaCl (optimum, 0). In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, D-glucose, D-maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, L-arabinose, Malic acid, N-acetyl- glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and D-melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 7candor C18:1 6c). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA GCC content of the type strain is 71.07 mol. The type strain IF7SW-B2Tis isolated from the International Space Station. DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The 16S rRNA gene sequences of Methylobacterium sp. IIF1SW- B5, and Methylobacterium sp.
