TheFusarium oxysporum species complex represents one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide, causing disease in many economically important plants and crops ( 1), but can also cause opportunistic infections in humans ( 2,3). However, F. oxysporum , like other fungi, produces many bioactive compounds that are benecial to humans ( 4,5) and could be exploited for use in the pharmaceutical medical industries. During the course of the Veggie project (a vegetable productionsystem own onboard the International Space Station ISS to study the effects of thespace environment on plant growth and function), Zinnia hybrida plants became aficted with a foliar, stem, and root rot disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum . Isolates were cultured from the leaf (VEG-01C1) and the root (VEG-01C2) of these infected plants, and the draft whole-genome sequences are described herein. The whole-genome sequences were paired-end sequenced (2 H11003100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size. A total of 33 million reads (GCcontent, 47.5) and 46 million reads (GC content, 46.8) were obtained from VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, respectively. Trimmomatic, on the Galaxy server ( https: usegalaxy.org ), was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings, max mismatch, 2; how accurate the match between the two adaptor ligated reads, 30; how accuratethematchbetweenanyadaptor,10)andtotrimtheleadingandtrailingends(settings,minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled with ABySS version 2.0.2 ( 6) using k-mer sizes of 80 (VEG-01C1) and 88 (VEG-01C2).TheVEG-01C1assemblyresultedina genomesizeof49.3Mb,withan N50 value of 376,797 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,455, with a max scaffold length of 1,817,733 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 588. TheVEG-01C2 assembly resulted in a genome size of 48.9 Mb, with an N 50of 334,342 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,398, with a max scaffold length of 2,326,957bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 637. The assembled genomes were compared to those of 66 F. oxysporum isolates downloaded from NCBI ( ftp:ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.govgenomesgenbankfungiFusarium _oxysporum ),aswellasthoseoftwoisolatesculturedfromISSenvironmentalsurfaces, using (i) 10 phylogenetically informative loci ( 7) and (ii) the presenceabsence of effector proteins ( 8). Both methods showed that VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2 were most closely related to F. oxysporum IMV-00293, an isolate cultured in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster (GenBank assembly accession number GCA_001931975).

Accession number(s). The assembled whole-genome sequences have been depos- ited in DDBLEMBLGenBank under the accession numbers PXUO00000000 (VEG-01C1) andPXUN00000000 (VEG-01C2). The strains have also been deposited in NASAs GeneLab; https:genelab-data.ndc.nasa.govgenelabaccessionGLDS-177 . These are the rst versions.
