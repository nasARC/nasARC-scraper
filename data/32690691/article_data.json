Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2are recognized as ubiquitous el- ements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encodestimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and fre- quency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bac- terial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca 2transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca2dynamics during the trigger- ing of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibitedCa 2-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca2from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic pheno- types. We have therefore explore d how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2signaling and related defense respons es. The double-knockout aca411 exhibited increased basal Ca2levels and Ca2signals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca2dynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes cou ld be suppressed by growing the aca411 seedlings at elevated tempera tures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tono-plast also suppressed the aca411 phenotypes but not when a cata- lytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca 2sequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca 2pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps. autoinhibited calcium ATPase calcium flg22 vacuole Plant pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment and plants have evolved sensory systems to recognize their presence and trigger appropriate defense responses. One of the best charac- terized of these sensing networks is through plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bindpathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): That is, con-served molecular signals of pathogen presence, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin. Upon PAMP-binding, the PRRs trigger an immune response termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) thatcan lead to the rapid development of both local and plant-wide defense (systemic acquired resist ance) (1). The best-characterized of the PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2). This protein acts with a coreceptor, BAK1, andis responsible for recognizing bacterial flagellin (or minimally the flg22 peptide epitope within flagellin) (2, 3) and triggers the sig- naling systems that lead to PTI. Induction of these local and systemic responses involves the activation of myriad cellular signaling events at sites of pathogen perception, such as protein phosphorylation cascades, productionof reactive oxygen species, anion fluxes, and apoplastic alkaliza-tion (1, 4 6). One of these major hallmarks of early PTI responses is a rapid influx of Ca 2into the cytosol immediately after PAMPrecognition. The subsequent change in cytosolic Ca2level is then thought to play a role in triggering downstream responses (7 9). Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encodestimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, andfrequency: Their so-called calcium signature (10). Calcium sig- natures are determined by an interplay between Ca 2permeable channels, exchangers, and pumps (11). Two cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs 2 and 4) have emerged as likely keyplayers in the Ca 2influx supporting the flg22-triggered signaling system under nonlimiting soil Ca2levels (12). However, other channels are likely also involved as the cngc24 double mutant attenuates, but does not abolish, the flg22-induced Ca2change. Similarly, although CNGC2 and -4 are thought to mediate Ca2 influx at the plasma membrane, whether release from internalCa 2stores plays a major role in these signaling events remains to be fully characterized. Despite this important role for channels ingenerating such defense-related Ca 2signals, building evidence also suggests an important role for Ca2efflux pumps in innate immune Ca2signaling. In particular, m utants of P2B-type ATPases, or autoinhibited calcium ATPases (ACAs) (13), have been shown to exhibit aberrant patterns of PTI (14, 15). Significance Ca2signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant im- mune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitorpeptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutantsmissing tonoplast Ca 2pumps, it causes disrupted Ca2signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca2pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplastpump knockout mutant s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca 2signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for theproper maintenance of Ca 2dynamics in innate immune re- sponses but that any regulatory systems specific to the en- dogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to supportthese signaling events.

Conversely, disruption of the tonoplast ACAs, ACA4 and ACA11, renders plants to be constitutivelydefense responsive, but whether these phenotypes are related toaberrations in Ca 2signaling remains unknown (14). We report that aca411 mutants show elevated basal Ca2and an increased Ca2signal in response to flg22. Elevated temperature is known to suppress defense-response phenotypes and growth at hightemperatures rescued both the altered Ca2dynamics and ab- errant downstream pathogen responses. Furthermore, we reportthat the relocalization of a plasma membrane ACA (ACA8) tothe tonoplast rescues the aca411 phenotype. These observations imply that tonoplast-localized Ca 2pumping is integral to main- taining homeostatic Ca2levels and for the initiation of proper PTI responses. However, because the relocalized plasma mem-brane pump can rescue the tonoplast knockout phenotypes, anyregulatory motifs specific to the tonoplast pumps may not be re-quired to support normal Ca 2signaling in the flg22-triggered response network. Results aca411 Leaves Exhibit Elevated Baseline Ca2Levels. The aca411 tonoplast ACA pump knockout shows an enhanced defense re-sponse, but its effects on Ca2dynamics are unstudied (14). We therefore monitored cytoplasmic Ca2dynamics in aca411 plants expressing the ratiometric, genetic ally encoded, fluorescent protein- based Ca2sensor YC-Nano65 (16). As Ca2levels increase, the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) s ignal from YC-Nano65 falls and the FRET signal from the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) partnerin the sensor increases. An increasing change in the FRET:CFPratio ( R) therefore reflects increasing cytosolic Ca 2(Ca2Cyt). aca411 mutants spontaneously form lesions around the time of inflorescence bolting, so we only imaged plants that had not yetdeveloped lesions to mitigate potential imaging artifacts fromdead cells. We obtained the mean FRET:CFP ratio values over3 h for entire rosette leaves of Col-0 and aca411 and observed a significant elevation in baseline Ca 2Cytinaca411 plants (Fig. 1). Similarly, we tested Ca2Cytvalues in intact and de- tached cotyledons of 10-d-old seedlings and observed a similarpattern of basal Ca2Cytelevation in aca411 (SI Appendix , Fig. S1). Such a sustained Ca2elevation may be associated with lesion formation as the infiltration of leaves with an avirulent strain ofthe phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) has also been reported to elicit sustained Ca2elevations that preceded hypersensitive lesion formation (17 19). flg22-Dependent Ca2Signals Are Elevated in aca411 .The forma- tion of spontaneous hypersensitive lesions is a characteristic oflesion-mimic mutants and indicative of a deregulated immuneresponse (20), implying that aca411 may be showing a similar disruption in defense signaling. Thus, we decided to test theCa 2signaling response to the PAMP flg22 (2, 3, 5, 21) in the aca411 background. We first established that 1 M flg22 elicited a clear Ca2increase in Col-0 and was below the saturating concentration for the response ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 ). Using this 1-M concentration as our treatment, we found that flg22 eli- cited a larger Ca2increase in aca411 rosette leaves and coty- ledons when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 2, SI Appendix , Fig. S3 , and Movies S1 S4), suggesting that tonoplast-localized ACAs are important for the proper efflux of Ca2from the cytoplasm during signaling events related to PAMP perception. ACA4 and ACA11 are ubiquitously expressed (22), as is the FLS2 receptor, and so we asked whether Ca2signaling in response to flg22 was generically disrupted in the double-mutant background in ourexperiments to help us focus on where ACA4- and ACA11-dependent events were likely to be most prominent. Therefore,we grew plants under the same conditions where aca411 showed differences in the flg22-triggered cotyledon Ca 2response but assayed responses in the root. SI Appendix , Fig. S4 shows that we could detect both the previously documented flg22-induced in-hibition of root growth (23) and flg22-triggered Ca2increase at the root tip (24) in wild-type Col-0 seedlings, indicating thatseedling roots were indeed flg22-responsive under these condi-tions. However, neither of these flg22-induced responses weresignificantly different between aca411 and Col-0 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 AC). Furthermore, and unlike the shoot tissue, the baseline Ca 2Cytinaca411 root tips was not significantly dif- ferent to Col-0 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ), suggesting a potentially smaller impact on cellular Ca2homeostasis of loss of ACA4 and ACA11 function at the root tip than in the shoot of theseplants. It is important to note here that our results do not rule out a regulatory role for ACA4 andACA11 in root Ca2signaling and defense response. For example, flg22 responses in regions out-side of the root tip or in plants of different ages or grown underdifferent conditions may be altered in the aca411 background. However, these results are consistent with Behera et al. (25),who similarly saw no shift in baseline Ca 2and little effect on root tip Ca2signaling in response to exogenous ATP in aca411 roots. Taking these observations together suggested to us thatfocusing on analyses of shoot rather than root responses shouldbe the most likely to reveal aca411 -dependent events. Thus, since our results indicated that aca411 defense-signaling phenotypes appear prominent in the shoot tissue, where the lesion-mimicphenotype manifests, and are evident in both mature leaves andcotyledons, we decided to concentrate subsequent analyses onthese aerial parts of the plant, using the cotyledons as our majororgan for assay of Ca 2responses. The whole-organ imaging we used to capture the responses quantified in Fig. 2 does not resolve individual cells and so in-evitably includes some degree of av eraging over multiple respond- ing cells. Thus, the aca411 -related changes in the Ca2signal dynamics seen in the aerial organs in response to flg22 describedabove could reflect: 1) All of the cells being measured showing asimilar elevated flg22-triggered rise in Ca 2, or 2) most aca411 cells behaving with the wild type-like response but with a subsetshowing a much bigger response. In order to discriminate betweenthese possibilities for the altered Ca 2response in the aca411 background, we used confocal ratio imaging to follow changes afterflg22 addition with single-cell resolution. This approach allowed us B A High Low Col-0 aca411 Fig. 1. Basal Ca2levels are elevated in aca411 rosette leaves.

Fig. 3 shows that the elevated response appears homogeneouswithin responding cells (Fig. 3 A) and is mirrored in both individual cellular response in different regions across the organ and in theaverage response of a subregion of the cotyledon (Fig. 3 BandC). These results are consistent with the effect of the aca411 lesion leading to a general elevation of Ca 2response in all cells rather than reflecting novel responses of a subpopulation. Elevated Temperature Suppresses Lesion Formation and flg22-Dependent Ca2Signals in aca411 .Many lesion-mimic mutants exhibit lesion suppression when grown in elevated temperatures (20, 26), likelydue to reduced biosynthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid(27). While aca411 plants grown at 22 C exhibited dwarfism and eventually formed lesions, growth at 28 C suppressed both of these aca411 phenotypes, an effect that became more obvious as the plants grew larger rosettes (Fig. 4 A). We also used molecular markers of the flg22 response to characterize how aca411 may affect induction of defense pathways. We first characterized that in wild-type, a 30-min time point after flg22 treatment capturedthe induction of CPB60g ,PHI1 ,ICS1 ,a n d FRK1 ,a l lc o m p o n e n t s of PTI induction (28, 29). We also confirmed that the basal ex- pression of these genes was not significantly altered in the variousgenotypes or under the temperature regimes used in the absence of flg22 ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 5 ).

Thus, FRK1 provided us with a marker that may operate independently of Ca2signal dynamics, and so of aca411 -related effects. Indeed, we observed that the 30-min flg22-dependent in-crease in FRK1 ,PHI1 ,a n d ICS1 transcripts were unaltered in the aca411 background when compared to wild-type Col-0 plants (Fig. 4 B). However, induction of the defense regulator CBP60g and resistance to Pstbacterial challenge (seen as a reduction in extractable colony forming units of bacteria) were both elevated inaca411 plants, with the resistance phenotype being most evident over the initial invasion at 1 d postinoculation (1 DPI) (Fig. 4 C). As seen for the dwarfing phenotype, suppression of both flg22-induced elevation of defense gene induction and pathogen resis-tance occurred in aca411 at 28 C (Fig. 4 BandC). Since the above aca411 phenotypes were suppressed at 28 C, we sought to determine if elevated temperature could also sup-press the disrupted flg22-dependent Ca 2responses. Growth at 28 C caused a reduction in the magnitude of this response inboth Col-0 and aca411 , with the degree of aca411 response at 28 C now closely mirroring that of Col-0 at this temperature(Fig. 4 E). Interestingly, the FRET:CFP values for aca411 were still significantly higher than Col-0 at both 22 C and 28 C andCol-0 baseline was higher at 28 C than 22 C (Fig. 4 Dand SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). Thus, growth at elevated temperature appeared to raise the basal Ca 2l e v e li nb o t hC o l - 0a n d aca411 ,b u ta l s o dampened the subsequent flg22-induced Ca2increase to the same degree in both backgrounds. One explanation of these altered response kinetics between aca411 and Col-0 at altered temperatures would be that the sensitivity of the plants to flg22 had changed through alterationin FLS2 levels, rather than more directly affecting Ca2ho- meostatic and signaling-related mechanisms. However, we did notdetect any significant differences in FLS2 protein or FLS2 tran- script levels between genotypes or temperature treatments, sug-gesting that the differences in flg22-dependent Ca 2signaling is independent of FLS2 receptor levels and likely reflects temperature-related events downstream of receptor activation ( SI Appendix , Fig. S7 ). Tonoplast Localization of ACA8 Rescues aca411 -Associated Phenotypes. It is known that the aca411 lesioning phenotype is rescued by expression of either ACA4 orACA11 in this mutant background (14). Such data provide a clear link between lesioning behavior and these two tonoplast ACAs. The rescue likely works as the native pumps, with all of their regulatory systems, are being reintroduced into the membrane in which they normally operate. Indeed, the ACAs form a multigene family with clades that map to particular organellar membranes ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 8 ), and thus it seems likely that particular family members are tailored to operate within the lipid milieu and regulatory networks associated with a particular membrane environment. We asked if this idea was true by targeting a nontonoplast ACA to the tonoplast of the aca411 double knockout and assessing its ability to rescue the double-knockout phenotypes. We chose to relocalize ACA8, a plasma membrane pump, to the tonoplast due to its significant divergence from ACA4 and ACA11 in its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. This is the region where much of this family of pump s regulation has been localized (3033) and where a large amount of its isoform-dependent amino acid sequence diversity resides ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 8 ). In order to relocalize ACA8, we deleted its C-terminal tail and replaced it with the analogous region of ACA11 (thus creating the chimericACA8-11C). The C terminus of ACA11 contains two sequences indicative of tonoplast localization, a dileucine (DXXXLL) and a tyrosine (YXX ) motif, where X is any amino acid and is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 9 ) (29, 34). Furthermore, we created a version of the ACA8-11C chimeric pump with a point mutation in the P-loop of the core pump region (ACA8-D482A) that converted a conserved aspartate known to beimportant for pump activity into an alanine, effectively inactivating the pump (35). For both ACA8-11C and its D482A variant we generated versions tagged at the C terminus with mGFP5 (for localization studies).

All pump variants were driven by theconstitutive AtUBQ10 promoter. Fig. 5 shows that both ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A- mGFP5 colocalized with the dye LysoTrackerRed DND-99, known to label the acidic vacuolar lumen and highlight the tonoplast membrane (36 39). We confirmed that DND-99 is a robust to- noplast marker in pavement cells by showing it colocalizes with thetonoplast-localized protein -TIP-CFP (40) (Fig. 5). Further analyses throughout the plant indicated that neither ACA8-11C- mGFP5, D482A-mGFP5, nor -TIP-CFP colocalized with the plasma membrane marker FM5-95 in, for example, cells of the root differentiation and elongation zone, leaf guard cells, or in shoot-derived protoplasts, suggesting that ACA8-11C-mGFP5 andD482A-mGFP5 were relocalized from the plasma membrane tothe tonoplast (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 0 ). Although such relocalization is likely being driven by the C-terminal di-leucine and tyrosine motifs we had engineered onto this protein, wecannot discount that overexpression alone is driving mistargetingof the chimeric pump. Irrespective of precise retargeting mecha- nism, our results indicate tonoplast localization of the ACA8-11C and D482A-mGFP5. ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5, was able to rescue the growth and lesion phenotype of aca411 (Fig. 6 Aand SI Appendix , Fig. S11 ), suggesting that ACA8 must retain func- tional pump capacity to rescue the double-knockout phenotype.Importantly, overexpression of ACA8 at its native location at the plasma membrane did not rescue these phenotypes in the aca4 11background, indicating that Ca 2efflux activity specifically at the tonoplast is required for rescue ( SI Appendix , Fig. S12 ). In parallel experiments, UBQ10::ACA8-11C-FLAG was transformed into aca411 plants expressing YC-Nano65, revealing that basal Ca2levels and flg22-dependent Ca2signals were similar to Col- 0 and significantly lower than the aca411 mutant (Fig. 6 C,SI Appendix ,F i g .S 6 ,a n d Movie S5 ), These results indicated that the relocalized pump had also rescued the Ca2phenotype of aca411. Interestingly, following the flg22 Ca2response over time scales that captured recovery from the i nitial flg22-induced peak in Ca2cytindicated that both Col-0 and aca411 could restore basal Ca2levels at similar time points despite aca411 showing an el- evated peak Ca2amplitude after flg22 treatment (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, expression of ACA8-11C-FLAG in the aca411 background restored longer-term recovery kinetics to resemble wild-type. Although there was an apparent trend for setting even lower Ca2levels than in wild-type over this recovery period in these ACA8-11C-FLAG lines, this change was not statistically significant. We also found that the flg22-induction of defense transcripts that we previously noted as not being altered in the aca411 background ( FRK1 ,PHI1 , and ICS1 ) (Fig. 6 B) was unaffected by expressing either ACA8-11C or D482A in the aca411 back- ground (although PHI1 did show a small reduction in levels of induction from 12- to 10-fold when D482A was expressed, and FRK1 increased from 10- to 13-fold). However, induc- tion of CPB60g andPstresistance, features that we have previ- ously seen to be altered in aca411 (Fig. 6 BandD), were rescued to wild-type like levels by expressing ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5 (Fig. 6 BandD). Again, the effects on the defense phenotype of aca411 was most evident in the earlier stages of invasion at 1 DPI (Fig. 6 D). Discussion Ca2-based signaling has been closely linked to PTI, with elicitors such as flg22 triggering Ca2changes (e.g., refs. 23, 39) that are thought to play prominent roles in downstream signaling events (1, 46). In this study we showed that tonoplast-localized Ca2pumps appear to not only be modulators of Ca2homeostasis, but playan important role in regulating both response to the PAMP flg22 and in the induction of PTI. Plasma membrane Ca2pumps have likewise been linked to PAMP signaling, with for example, ACA8 thought to form a complex with the FLS2 receptor (15). However,knocking out these plasma membrane Ca2efflux pumps that would be thought to play roles in limiting and eventually resetting increases in Ca2signals, has been reported to actually attenuate PAMP-triggered Ca2responses and downstream signaling (15). In addition, although aca810 plants show elevated baseline Ca2, they do not display spontaneous lesion formation (15). Taken together, these observations suggest a potentially complex role forthe plasma membrane pumps in signal processing outside of theirability to pump out, and so normally limit, PAMP-induced cyto- plasmic Ca 2signals. In contrast, we found that knockouts in the vacuolar ACAs led to elevated baseline Ca2within the cell (Fig. 1), a larger flg22-induced Ca2increase (Figs. 2 and 3), and elevated levels of downstream PTI responses (Fig. 4 B). These observations are all consistent with these tonoplast pumps con-tributing to maintenance of low basal Ca2levels and playing roles in limiting the magnitude of cytoplasmic Ca2signals, signals that are themselves important mediators of PTI signaling. A Role for Temperature in Regulating Early PTI Responses. Elevated temperature is known to attenuate defense signaling (27) and astheaca411 plants show phenotypes pointing at runaway PTI events (lesion mimicry, elevated defense responses, increased Ca2signaling to flg22), we used this treatment to ask if the high- temperature effect suppressed both Ca2dynamics and other defense-response phenotypes. Indeed, elevated temperature at- tenuated the PTI-related Ca2dynamics in aca411 to wild- typelike characteristics and these changes correlated with res- cue of other elevated defense responses, such as defense gene induction and pathogen resistance (Fig. 4 BandC). These higher temperatures affected the attenuation of flg22-dependent Ca2 signals in both Col-0 and aca411 plants (Fig. 4 E), suggesting that common temperature-dependent components of the Ca2efflux machinery are affected in both genotypes. Although previousstudies have indicated that PTI responses, including positive reg-ulation of defense transcripts and MAPK activation, are favored at elevated temperatures (41), our experiments indicate that Ca 2 signaling, a canonic PTI response, is suppressed at elevated tem- perature, consistent with reports that defense-response systems are compromised at higher temperatures, likely through alter- ations in salicylic acid-dependent pathways (29). Transporters at the Tonoplast Shape the Calcium Signature. Along with previous work on aca411 defense and lesion phenotypes (14), our study indicates that the activity of ACAs at the tono- plast is important for PTI and normal PAMP-dependent Ca2 signaling. Using a combination of modeling and direct Ca2 measurements using aequorin-expressing plants, Lenzoni et al.(42) have shown that not only the characteristics of the rising, but also the falling phase of Ca2transients are likely to be impor- tant for modulating subsequent defense-related gene expression.However, in our experiments, although aca411 had a significantly elevated Ca2signal in response to flg22 (Figs. 2 Band 3 BandC), both Col-0 and aca411 reached basal Ca2levels at similar time points (Fig. 6 C). This observation indicates that ACA4 and ACA11 are likely important for regulating the net influx of Ca2 during flg22 perception (i.e., the initial rising phase of the signal), while other efflux systems may be involved in the re-establishment of baseline Ca2.T h eC a2Hexchangers of the tonoplast have similarly been shown to operate in PTI, although the complex theyform may act as a response element downstream of the ini-tial perception and signaling machinery (43). The Ca 2Hex- changers are also known to play roles in abiotic stress responses (44) and indeed, previous work has implied that the tonoplastprovides a signaling hub for these classes of response. For Hilleary et al. PNAS August 4, 2020 vol. 117 no. 31 18853 PLANT BIOLOGYexample, in the moss Physcomitrella patens , knockout of the to- noplast calcium pump PCA1 resulted in NaCl-dependent Ca2 transients that were higher in amplitude and of longer duration(45). Thus, it will be of interest to assess whether ACA4 andACA11 also play roles in abiotic stress-related Ca 2signaling. We also show that relocalization of a plasma membrane Ca2 pump, ACA8, to the tonoplast rescued the phenotypes associ- ated with the aca411 tonoplast pump knockout. Several studies have indicated that dileucine motifs are involved in the locali- zation of tonoplast membrane proteins (46 48), and so we have capitalized on this machinery to retarget nontonoplast proteinsto the tonoplast for functional rescue experiments. Thus, al- though when we overexpressed native ACA8, it targeted to the plasma membrane ( SI Appendix , Fig. S12 ), expression of this same pump engineered with the C terminus of ACA11 was tar- geted to the tonoplast, with little indication of a plasma mem- brane localized fraction (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix , Fig. S10 ). Relocalization of ACA8 to the tonoplast sometimes led to the formation of bulbstructures ( SI Appendix , Fig. S13 ), which are believed to be artifacts due to the dimerization of GFP (49). However, as we used mGFP5 a monomeric form of GFP that should not dimerize, whether these bulbs are bona fide tonoplaststructures (50) potentially enriched in ACA8-11C will require future study. ACAs are typified by the presence of a calmodulin-binding N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that restricts pump activity(35, 51 53) and accounts for much of the variability between ACA isoforms ( SI Appendix , Fig. S8 ). The autoinhibitory domain can undergo posttranslational modifications that can potentiallymodulate the binding capacity of calmodulin or calmodulin-like (CML) proteins. For example, the autoinhibitory domain of ACA8 appears to be regulated by CML36 (32). This region canalso be phosphorylated (30, 31), but in general the molecular identities of the modifiers of ACA action remain undefined. Despite the differences between the N-terminal domains of ACA4, ACA11, and ACA8 ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 8 ), ACA8-11C was still able to functionally rescue the aca411 mutant phenotypes. This observation suggests that Ca 2transport across the tonoplast by an ACA is the critical feature for this signaling system but, at the same time, that it may not require regulatory circuits specificallytailored to Ca2pumps normally targeted to this location. The failure of the pump-dead D482A mutant of ACA8-11C to rescue theaca411 phenotype reinforces the idea of this essential role for pumping activity. Thus, the proliferation of ACA family pumps through evolutionary time may have been necessitated to specifythe localization of pumps to relevant membranes with a diver- gence event segregating ACAs into plasma membrane and non- plasma membrane localizations. Alt hough specific regulatory events associated with each membrane loc ale may have evolved, the basic core pumping activity of these tra nsporters appears robust enough to work in varied cellular locations. Similarly, the Ca2homeo- static system appears flexible enough to integrate heterologous pumping activity into a system capable of supporting normalCa2-based signaling activities. Thus, the Ca2signaling system of pumps and channels shows the features of resilience and com- pensation reminiscent of the scale-free genetic networks thatcharacterize many other cellular regulatory systems (54).

Plants imaged for rosette area were germinated in growth chambers set at22 C or 28 C, 16-h light8-h dark, then transplanted to soil (Propagation Mix,SunGro Horticulture) 7 to 10 d after germination and watered with deionizedwater. Images were obtained once a day and rosette areas were calculatedusing FIJI (56). Membrane Staining. Three- to 5-d-old seedlings were incubated in 12 LS liquid media containing 1 M FM5-95 (ThermoFisher) for 5 min on ice. Seedlings were similarly stained with 2 M LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Ther- moFisher) but were incubated for 30 min in 12 LS liquid media containingdye, then washed in 12 LS media without dye for 3 h at room temperature prior to imaging. Images were acquired on an LSM 780 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 40 Water, NA 0.9 objective. GFP and FM5-95 were excited with 488-nm laser, using a 488 dichroic mirror and emission at500 to 550 nm for GFP or 600 to 700 nm for FM5-95. Lysotracker Red DND-99was excited with a 561-nm laser (488561 dichroic; emission 600 to 650 nm).Pearson s and Spearman s correlation coefficients for colocalization were calculated using the PSC Colocalization Plugin in FIJI (57). Ratiometric Ca 2Imaging. Cotyledons were detached from seedlings grown under sterile conditions on plates, as described above, for 7 to 10 d or forrosette leaves from soil grown plants, 20 d after germination. Detachedleaves were placed between a thin layer of 12 LS  10 mM sucrose, 0.5 (wt vol) Phytagel and a coverslip, adaxial side down, 2 h prior to imaging. A 1-cm1-cm well was cut into the gel prior to imaging for the application of solutions. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocalmicroscope with a 5 0.16 M27 EC Plan-Neofluar or 20 0.75 Plan- Apochromat objective. Excitation of the YC-Nano65 sensor was performed with the 458-nm laser line and emission for cpVenus and CFP were obtainedat 525 to 540 nm and 460 to 505 nm, respectively. Whole-leaf imaging wasperformed as in Lenglet, et al. (58). Briefly, a Nikon stereomicroscope (SMZ- 25) equipped with a 1 objective (P2-SHR PLAN APO, Nikon), W-VIEW image-splitting optics (Hamamatsu), and a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu)were used to image 20-d-old rosette leaves of YC-Nano65 expressing plants every 30 s. The cpVenus signal arises from FRET from its CFP partner. As Ca 2 levels rise this FRET signal increases and the CFP emission decreases. Time- series FRET data were normalized via the following equation: RR o(R- Ro)Ro, where Ris the ratio of cpVenus emission (FRET):CFP emission and Rois the average baseline value of this FRET ratio prior to flg22 treatment. FRET ratio data were analyzed using the image calculator tool in FIJI (56)using a region of interest encompassing the entire leaf or cotyledon. Ratiometric Ca 2imaging for whole rosette leaves was performed with a motorized stereomicroscope equipped with image-splitting optics, as pre-viously described (58). qPCR. The total RNA for all samples was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and any contaminating genomic DNA was degraded with TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer s instructions.

Pathogenesis Assays. Ten-day-old seedlings were flood-inoculated essentially as in Ishiga et al. (59). Seedlings were grown in 12-well plates containing 12LS salts and 0.5 (wtvol) Phytagel solid media. On the day of infection, Pst DC3000 (pVSP61) inoculum was suspended in sterile water with 0.025 (volvol) Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds) to an OD 595nm 0.01 ( 8.0106CFUmL of bacteria) and 3 mL of inoculum was added to each well for 3 min, decanted,and tissue harvested from 5 to 10 seedlings per biological replicate at 1 and3 DPI. After harvesting, tissue fresh weight was measured, and the sampleswere surface-sterilized with 5 (volvol) H 2O2for 5 min and rinsed three times with sterile water. Tissue was placed in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes andmacerated in sterile water for 5 min in a 1600 miniG (Spex SamplePrep) setat 1,000 strokes per minute. Macerated tissue was serially diluted in sterile water and spread onto LB plates containing 25 M rifampicin. Colonies per plate were counted after incubating at 28 C for 48 h.Protoplast Isolation. Protoplasts were isolated from 10-d-old seedling shoot tissue essentially as in Zhai et al. (60). Confocal imaging of protoplasts wasperformed with identical settings as described for mGFP5 and FM5-95. Microsomal Fraction Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis. Microsomal preparations and Western blots were performed as previously described (61). Briefly, 10-d-old seedlings were homogenized in extraction buffer (250 mM Sorbitol, 50 mM Hepes-BTP, 25 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM DTT, 6 mM EGTA1.2 wtvol Polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and Roche cOmplete protease inhibi-tor mixture Sigma-Aldrich, pH 7.4). The homogenate was filtered withcheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 gfor 15 min, the supernatant re- covered and then centrifuged at 60,000 gfor 30 min to pellet the mi- crosomal fraction. Microsomes were resuspended in extraction buffer and protein concentration measured with BCA Reagent (ThermoFisher) to ensure equal loading for SDSPAGE. After transfer of protein to nitrocellulose, blotswere incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies for anti-H -PPase (52) and anti-FLS2 (Agrisera) and then probed with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody and developed via chemiluminescence. Phylogenetic Analysis. Sequence alignment and tree construction was based on either the whole protein sequence or N-terminal amino acid domains oftheA. thaliana ACAs with AtECA3 as an outgroup. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using Mega6 (62) with 1,000 bootstraps and a Poisson model. Data Availability.
