This study evaluated C57BL6 mice on Day 40 after total-body56Fe26irradiation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 gray (Gy). Radiation consistently increased thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were similar among all groups. In the blood, there was no radiation effect on the white blood cell (WBC) count or majorleukocyte types. However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8 T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogen-esis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls ( P0.05 vs 0 Gy). In con- trast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were allsignicantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls ( P0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in CD11b  granulocytes in the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b CD54, CD11b CD62E ) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) wasequivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34Sca-1, were low in one or more of the irradiated groups ( P0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that signicant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56Fe irradiation and that there are dif- ferences dependent upon body compartment. KEYWORDS: particle radiation, total-body irradiation, hematopoiesis, mouse model, space ight INTRODUCTION The impact of radiation on astronaut health, especially during extended deep-space missions, continues to be a signi cant concern to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Since current guidelines of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) apply only to low Earth orbit (LEO)missions 1, the need for data on radiation effects beyond LEO isincreasing as space exploration proceeds. Exposure to relatively highdoses and various forms of radiation during space ight beyond LEO is inevitable. Sources include galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which ori-ginates from outside our solar system, and solar particle events (SPEs), which appear sporadically and are unpredictable 2. During extended deep-space missions to Mars and elsewhere, crew members could receive relatively high doses of radiation 3 5.The great majority of cosmic radiation is composed of protons (86) and helium ions (11). High-charge and high-energy (HZE)ions represent a very small percentage of the various forms of spaceradiation, i.e. 1. Of these, 56Fe is considered to be the most important because of its high linear energy transfer (LET). Although many body systems could be adversely affected, the immune system is especially radiosensitive. Immune depressionandor dysfunction could lead to overwhelming infection and otherpathologies, which could increase the risk of mission failure andpossibly decrease quality of life after return to Earth. Potentialimmunological aberrations associated with radiation and other stres-sors in the space ight environment (e.g. alterations in gravitational force, hypoxia and psychological stress of con nement) have been summarized relatively recently 6.

In addition, ground-based studies that simulate space radiation and other stres- sors have shown signi cant changes in immune parameters com- pared with controls 18 28. The great majority of the space radiation-associated studies have used photons ( -rays, X-rays) and to a lesser extent also protons. Overall, there is much less knowl-edge regarding immune effects after exposure to HZE ions. This isimportant to note because different forms of radiation do not alwaysresult in identical outcomes 20, 29 31. Although progress certainly has been made in understanding the direct and indirect health risks associated with high-chargehigh-energy particle radiation during space exploration, the immuno-logical responses are complex and many questions still remain 32.The current study was one of a series done with 56Fe radiation in murine models in order to con rm and extend our previous nd- ings. In those studies, we found drastic reductions in virtually all characterized immune parameters, with associated changes in ex vivo function, four days post-irradiation 33 36. While most of the population recovered by Day 110 113 30, 36, there were still some strain-dependent changes in T and B cell populations 30 days post-exposure 34. Those ndings are extensively compared with the present data in the discussion. The major goal here was to deter-mine the effect of whole-body 56Fe26irradiation on leukocyte distri- bution and function at a relatively long time-point after exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and total-body irradiation The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Loma Linda University (LLU) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) approved this study. The animals were in the BNL-7 run of theNASA radiation health experimental series. C57BL6 J female mice(n60) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA, and shipped directly to BNL at 8 9 weeks of age. After an acclimatization period of 1 week, non-anesthetized animals were placed individually into well-aerated polystyrene boxes (volume 3 36 cm) and were exposed to iron ions ( 56Fe, Z26, 1 GeVnucleon, LET 148.2 keV m track average) using the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). Additional beam char-acteristics can be found elsewhere 37, 38. The radiation was deliv-ered in a single fraction to total doses of 1, 2 and 3 Gy at a doserate of 1 Gymin at beam entry. A 0 Gy control group was treated in an identical manner but without irradiation. Several days later the animals were shipped to LLU. On Day 40 after irradiation, the micewere weighed and then rapidly euthanized in 100 CO 2 Specimen collection and processing Spleen, thymus, liver and right lung were collected and weighedimmediately after euthanasia. Organ mass was normalized relative tobody mass using the following formula: Norm. mass organ mass (mg)body mass (g). Additional procedures were carried out aspreviously described 17, 33, 35. Brie y, blood was collected in syringes containing potassium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(K 2-EDTA; Fisher Scientic, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) via cardiac puncture. Spleens were placed into 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640medium (Irvine Scienti c, Santa Ana, CA, USA) that included 10 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, p rocessed into single-celled suspen- sions using autoclaved wooden applicator sticks, and then erythrocyteswere lysed using a standard procedures. Bone marrow was ushed from the right femur using 1 ml of complete RPMI-1640 medium. Automated hematological analysis of blood and spleen cells Whole blood and splenocyte samples (12 l) were evaluated using an ABC Vet Hematology Analyzer (Heska Corp., Waukesha, WI,USA). For the blood, this included a white blood cell (WBC) count,lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte counts and percentages, redblood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, hemoglobin (HGB)concentration, hematocrit (HCT; percentage of whole blood com-posed of RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV; mean volume per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; mean weight of hemoglobin per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration(MCHC; mean concentration of hemoglobin per RBC), RBC distri-bution width (RDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV). For thespleen, WBC counts and the numbers and percentages of the threemajor leukocyte populations were obtained. Spontaneous and mitogen-induced blastogenesis To determine spontaneous blastogenesis of cells in blood andspleen, aliquots were diluted with complete RPMI 1640 mediumand dispensed into wells of microculture plates. Immediately thereafter,1Ci of 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR), speci c activity 46 Cimmol (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) was added, and the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 Ci n5 C O 2. Counts per minute (cpm) for both blood and spleen were normalized to cell count. The response of spleen cells to three different mitogens, i.e. phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and lipopoly- saccharide (LPS) (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA), wasalso determined. After adjusting to 2 10 6cellsml in complete RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were dispensed into microtiter platewells, with and without each of the three mitogens (pre-titrated formaximal response), at 2 10 5splenic leukocytes0.2 mlwell and incubated for 48 h. During the last 4 h, the cells were pulse-labeledwith 3H-TdR at 1 Ci50 lwell. The cpms in response to the mitogens were converted to a stimulation index (SI): SI (cpm with mitogen cpm without mitogen)cpm without mitogen. In both types of assays described above, samples from each mouse were tested in triplicate. The cpm was obtained using aliquid beta-scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc.,Fullerton, CA, USA). Additional details for these procedures havebeen previously described 39, 40. Flow cytometry analysis of leukocyte subpopulations Leukocytes were evaluated for expression of surface markers usinguorescence-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Pharmingen,San Diego, CA, USA), a direct-staining procedure and aFACSCalibur TMow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The mAbs were labeled with uorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), R-phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), or peridi- nin chlorophyll protein (PerCP). For all mAb combinations478 D.S. Gridley and M.J. Pecautcharacterized in the spleen and blood, leukocytes were identi ed using antibody against cluster differentiation (CD) molecule CD45; lym- phocytesmononuclear cells were distinguished from granulocytesbased on CD45 versus side scatter gating. For lymphocytes, percen-tages () were de ned as a percent of the total mononuclear cell (MNC) count as de ned by the standard CD45 vs Side Scatter MNC gate. Similarly, for CD11b granulocytes, percentages were de ned as percent of cell counts within the granulocyte gate. Numerical valuesfor leukocyte subsets were calculated using the cell counts obtainedwith the automated hemocytometer (described above). In the blood and spleen, T helper (Th) lymphocytes were deter- mined using mAbs against CD3CD4, whereas mAbs against CD3CD8 were used to identify T cytotoxic (Tc) cells. In the spleen,CD11b granulocytes with and without adhesion makers CD54 and CD62E were identied. Similar procedures were also performedon mononuclear bone marrow cells to determine the percentagewith stem cell markers, i.e. CD34 and stem cell antigen 1 (Sca-1). In all cases, a minimum of 5000 events were analyzed per sample using CellQuest TMsoftware version 3.1 (Becton Dickinson).Statistical analysis One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using radi-ation dose as the independent variable. Tukey s pairwise multiple comparison test was used in post-hoc analysis when indicated. The program used was SigmaPlot for Windows version 13.0 (SystatSoftware, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). Data are presented asmeanstandard error of the mean (SEM), and a Pvalue of 0.05 was considered signi cant; P0.1 indicated a trend toward signicance. RESULTS Body and organ masses Figure 1 shows results for body and thymus masses. There were sig- nicant differences in thymus mass alone or when normalized to body mass. The thymus values were consistently higher in the irra- diated groups compared with the 0 Gy group (one-way ANOVA:P0.005), although Tukey s test showed a P0.05 only for the 2 Gy group versus the 0 Gy group. There were no signi cant differ- ences between groups in spleen, liver or lung masses, although one-way ANOVA indicated trends for a radiation dose effect ( P0.1) on spleen mass relative to body mass and lung mass alone(Table 1). Complete blood count The WBC counts and the three-part differential are presented inFig. 2. Of the three major leukocyte types, only monocyte numberswere consistently low in irradiated groups (one-way ANOVA:P0.1), and there was a strong trend for low counts in the 3 Gy Table 1.

Table 2 shows that the 3 Gy resulted in signicantly low RBC counts, HGB and HCT compared with the control group ( P0.05). All of the other evaluated para- meters relating to erythrocytes and platelets in the irradiated groups were equivalent to those of the 0 Gy group. Major leukocyte types in spleen Figure 3 shows that there was a radiation effect on WBC andlymphocyte counts in the spleen (one-way ANOVA: P0.05 and P0.005, respectively). Tukey s test revealed that WBC counts in the 1 Gy group were higher versus the 0 Gy group and that therewas a strong trend for high counts in the 2 Gy group ( P0.05 and P0.06, respectively). This was likely due to the high numbers of lymphocytes in the 1 and 2 Gy groups ( P0.05). A similar pattern was noted for monocytemacrophage and granulocyte counts, butthere was no statistical support. Percentages of these three major leukocyte types were equivalent to control values regardless of radi- ation (Fig. 3). Spontaneous and mitogen-induced blastogenesis The Fig. 4 upper panels show that radiation dose had a signi cant effect on spontaneous blastogenesis in the blood ( P0.05). A post- hocTukey s test showed that there were higher cpm in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups ( P0.05 vs 0 Gy). In the spleen, however, there were no signi cant differences or trends between the various groups. This was true for the spleen also with respect to the SIvalues obtained after mitogen-induced blastogenesis (lower panels of Fig. 4). Although there were steady dose-dependent decreases in PHA- and Con A-induced blastogenesis, this did not reach the levelof signi cance.Major lymphocyte types and T cell subsets in blood Figure 5 shows that radiation had no signi cant effect on T, B or NK cell counts or percentages. One-way ANOVA, however, did indicate a trend ( P0.1) for a radiation-induced decrease in T cell counts and percentages and an increase in B cell percentage; Tukey s test for B cells revealed a trend for 3 Gy vs the 0 Gy group ( P0.07). T cell subset data are presented in Fig. 6. Counts and percen- tages of CD4 Th cells were equivalent to normal. However, radi- ation had a highly signi cant effect on CD8 Tc cell counts and percentages (one-way ANOVA: P0.001). As far as Tc cell counts, the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups were lower compared with 0 Gy(P0.05). Tc cell percentages were signi cantly lower in all irra- diated groups compared with the 0 Gy group ( P0.05). This led to a signicantly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio compared with the 0 Gy group for all three irradiated groups ( P0.05). Major lymphocyte types and T cell subsets in the spleen Figure 7 shows the data for the three major lymphocyte popula-tions. Based on the one-way ANOVA, there was no radiation effecton T cell counts and only a trend was noted for T cells ( P0.1), with the 3 Gy group having a slightly lower percentage than the 0 Gy group ( P0.08). In contrast, there were signi cant radiation effects on B cell counts ( P0.005) and percentages ( P0.05). The B cell numbers were higher in the 1 Gy and 2 Gy groups versus the 0 Gy group ( P0.05), and there was a trend for a high count in the 3 Gy group ( P0.08). As far as B cells, only the 3 Gy group had a higher percentage compared with the 0 Gy group ( P0.05). NK cell counts were equivalent to normal, and there was only a trend for low percentages in the irradiated groups (one-way ANOVA: P0.1; Tukey s test: P0.08 for 3 Gy vs 0 Gy). The results for T cell subsets are shown in Fig. 8. The CD4  Th cell counts were signi cantly affected ( P0.005). Tukey s test indicated that the Th cell number was higher in the 2 Gy group(P0.05), and there was a trend for an increase in the 1 Gy group compared with the 0 Gy group. Th cell percentages, however, wereequivalent to normal throughout. In contrast to Th cells, the CD8  Tc cell counts were affected by radiation dose (one-way ANOVA:P0.05), but there were no signi cant differences between irra- diated groups and 0 Gy controls. There was, however, a highly sig-nicant radiation effect on Tc cell percentages (one-way ANOVA: P0.001); low proportions were present in all irradiated groups compared with the 0 Gy group ( P0.05). These ndings resulted in an elevated CD4:CD8 ratio in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups(P0.05 vs 0 Gy). Granulocytes with adhesion markers in the spleen These data are presented in Fig. 9. Although the numbers of granu-locytes expressing CD11b were similar in all groups, one-wayANOVA indicated a signi cant radiation dose effect on percentages (P0.05), most likely due to rela tively high values in the 1 Gy group. Tukey s test, however, showed only trends for CD11b: 0G yv s1G y( P0.09). When the CD11b cells were double- labeled with adhesion markers, i.e. either CD54 or CD62E, t h e r ew e r en os i g n i cant differences or tr ends in numbers orTable 2.

The values for these double-positive cells in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groupswere signi cantly lower than for the 0 Gy controls ( P0.05). DISCUSSION Body mass is considered to be an indicator of overall health. In ourstudy, there was no effect of 56Fe radiation on body mass at the 40-day post-exposure time-point. This is consistent with ourprevious studies in same strain mice that showed no effect on bodymass on Days 4 and 113 after 56Fe irradiation using doses of up to 3 Gy 35, 36. In other studies using56Fe, we have found that body mass is dependent on a number of variables such as radiation dose,mouse strain and time of assessment 41. In a rat model followedfor 9 months after exposure to 1 4G y 56Fe radiation, body mass was generally lower compared with controls 42, 43. When evaluating several different organ masses alone and in relation to body mass in our study, only the thymus was signi - cantly affected, i.e. consistently higher mass alone or in relation to Fig. 4.

Post-hoc Tukey s: (a) P0.05 vs 0 Gy.Leukocytes after iron ion irradiation 483body mass in the irradiated groups. The thymus is the primary site for T cell maturation and plays an important role in the induction of tolerance to self-antigens. Although this organ is most importantearly in life, it can participate in T cell regeneration under dire cir-cumstances in adults, thus resulting in increased thymic mass 44,45. In a previous study using similar doses of 56Fe radiation, we found that thymus and spleen (but not body, liver or lung) masses were signi cantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner on Day 4 35. The complete blood count (CBC) analysis of blood showed no signicant radiation effect on WBC count or on the counts or per- centages of the three major leukocyte types (lymphocytes, mono- cytes, granulocytes). There was, however, a strong trend for lowmonocyte numbers in the 3 Gy group. This was somewhat surpris- ing since monocytes, i.e. important members of the innate immunesystem, have long been known to be more radioresistant than lym-phocytes and granulocytes 46. A possible reason is that the mono- cytes may have migrated out of the blood circulation and becomelocalized at a site of injuryin ammation. In a previous study, we found 56Fe dose-dependent decreases in blood WBCs and in all three major leukocyte types on Day 4 post-irradiation, followed bycomplete recovery in cell numbers by Day 113; monocyte macro- phage percentages, however, were signi cantly decreased in both blood and spleen 36. Others have also noted great reduction inWBCs and the three major leukocyte types in mice during 4, 7and 14 days after 3 Gy 56Fe irradiation 47. This latter study also demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of androstenediol 30 min after exposure could signi cantly mitigate the detrimental effect. Fig. 5. Major lymphocyte types in blood.

Post-hoc Tukey s: (a) P0.07 vs 0 Gy.484 D.S. Gridley and M.J. PecautThe blood data also showed low RBC counts, HGB and HCT in the 3 Gy group, thereby indicating the possibility of anemia. Since hematopoietic stem cells are precursors to RBCs (as well asWBCs), our bone marrow data showing low levels of cells withhematopoietic stem cell markers are consistent with these ndings. Signi cant depression in all three of these parameters has also been noted on Day 4 after iron ion irradiation, with return to normal by Day 113 35, 36. In a comparison of 2 Gy iron, carbon and proton radiation, the 56Fe-irradiated group had the lowest RBC count, HGB and HCT at 110 days post-exposure, although statistical sig-nicance was not always obtained 30. Loss in RBC mass, due at least partly to destruction of newly released RBCs, and anemia havebeen consistently associated with space missions for many years48 50. As recently reviewed, the underlying mechanisms appear to be at least partly linked to neocytolysis under microgravity 51.Based on these and other reports, the addition of particle radiation exposure, especially during extended deep-space missions, could fur- ther exacerbate anemia in astronauts. Overall, we found that the radiation effect was much greater in the spleen than in blood. Although statistical support was not alwaysobtained, the consistently high numbers of WBCs and of the majorleukocyte types (especially lymphocytes) in spleens of the irradiated mice further supports the premise that hematopoiesis was still con- tinuing above a normal level. Data on lymphocyte subpopulations inthe blood showed only a trend for a radiation effect on T cells(number and percentage) and B cells (percentage). Further analysisshowed signi cant radiation-induced decreases in CD8 Tc cell counts and percentages, but no differences among groups in theCD4Th cells. These ndings led to a greatly increased CD4:CD8 ratio. A very similar pattern was also observed in the spleen, except Fig. 6. T cell subsets in blood. Data were obtained using ow cytometry.

Our ndings are consistent with previous reports on variations in the radiosensitivity of the major T cell subsets (CD8 CD4) using -rays 52 54, protons 55 and 56Fe 36. Some radiation- associated differences in lymphocyte subpopulation response maybe at least partly dependent on the rodent model used 34, 42.Since CD8 Tc lymphocytes kill cells that are virally infected or transformed to a potentially malignant phenotype, low numbers cer-tainly could compromise immune resistance during space missions.In addition, recent reports indicate that upon activation these cellsdifferentiate into subpopulations (e.g. Tc2, Tc9, Tc17, CD8 Treg cells) that, when not controlled properly, could lead to immuno-pathologies such as allergies and autoimmune diseases 56 58.Although hematopoiesis appeared to be upregulated in both the spleen and thymus, analysis of bone marrow consistently showed alow percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers (CD34, Sca-1).CD34 is expressed on early progenitor cells involved in hematopoi-esis, but has also been reported to be present on highly functionalendothelial cell progenitors 59 and as an important facilitator of cell migration 60. Sca-1 is a very common marker used to identify hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow, but is also expressed onsome cells in a variety of tissues that may serve as tissue-residentstem and progenitor cells 61. There is very little information regarding the impact of 56Fe on hematopoiesis. A mouse study that included lethal doses found that 56Fe radiation caused accelerated and more severe hematopoietic toxicity compared with -rays and protons 29. Interestingly, this latter study also found that56Fe had selective enhanced toxicity to Fig. 7. Major lymphocyte types in spleen.

Pecautbone marrow progenitor and stem cells because intestinal crypt cells did not show increased toxicity related to56Fe exposure. Based on a study of bone marrow cell phenotypes in mice shortly after a 13-day mission in space, the results suggested that the space ight mice had more differentiated cells within the very large and granular popula-tion compared with ground controls 16 More research is obvi-ously needed on the status of hematopoiesis and tissue regeneration in various body compartments under space ight conditions. Spontaneous blastogenesis for cells in the blood was consistently higher in the irradiated groups, with statistical signi cance obtained for 2 Gy and 3 Gy versus 0 Gy. This indicates ongoing DNA synthe- sis in cells entering the blood circulation from the bone marrow. Inthe spleen, however, spontaneous blastogenesis was equivalent tonormal, regardless of radiation, thereby suggesting no great need for leukocyte regeneration at the 40-day post-irradiation time-point. We have previously found that enhanced spontaneous blastogenesisafter whole-body 56Fe irradiation is more pronounced within a few days after exposure 33, 41. Since measuring lymphocyte response to mitogens is a common and effective way of screening for cellular immunode ciency 62, three different mitogens were selected for the recent study. PHA, alectin found in plants, is a classical activator of T cell proliferation,regardless of antigen speci city. ConA, another plant lectin, stimu- lates T cell subsets that include precursors to suppressor T cells63. LPS, a B cell activator, is a molecule found on the surface ofGram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli . In the irradiated groups, spleen cell ability to respond to the T cell mitogens PHAand ConA was relatively low and response to LPS was slightly ele-vated, but statistical support for any SI differences versus 0 Gy waslacking. In a previous study, we found signi cant depression in response to PHA and ConA, but not LPS, on Day 4 after exposureto either 2 Gy or 3 Gy 56Fe 33. Fig. 8. T cell subsets in spleen.

Post-hoc Tukey s: (a) P0.05 vs 0 Gy, (b) P0.05 vs 1 Gy, (c) P0.09 vs 0 Gy.Leukocytes after iron ion irradiation 487Based on these and other studies 41, it appears that56Fe radi- ation in the space ight environment may have no long-term effect on mitogen-induced responsiveness. However, abnormalities in these types of responses due to space ight conditions have been reported. For example, in vitro activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes has been reported to be severely depressed duringspace ight 64. Also, a recent study using ConA and several toll- like receptor (TLR) agonists found aberrations in the response ofmouse splenocytes after return from the STS-135 mission in space14. Concern regarding immune dysfunction that leads toincreased risk for infections, especially during extended missions, remains high. Expression of adhesion markers by granulocytes is important in leukocyte communication and migration to sites of damage. Neutrophils, by far the most abundant granulocyte, have a veryshort half-life in the blood circulation. In the spleen, however, thereare marginated or slowly transiting pools of these cells within thevascular compartment 65. In the current study, radiation-associated trends were noted in the percentage of CD11b single- label granulocytes in the spleen (slight increase in the 1 Gy groupand slight decreases in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups vs 0 Gy). CD11b is a trans-membrane protein (also known as Mac-1 and CR3) that binds to complement fragment C3bi. CD11b, as well as other adhe-sion molecules, are expressed not only by granulocytes but also bymonocytesmacrophages, dendritic cells and some lymphocytepopulations 66, 67. There was no radiation effect when CD11b cells were double- labeled with CD54, which is the intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) that binds to leukocyte function antigen-1, or whendouble-labeled with CD62E, which is involved in trans-endothelialcell migration. In a previous 56Fe study, we found the main effects of dose on CD11b and CD54 cell proportions in the spleen, but Fig. 9. Adhesion markers on granulocytes in spleen.

Nonetheless, more56Fe research in this area should be done. The impact of space ight on adhesion markers has been previ- ously noted. We found changes in genes encoding adhesion mole- cules and the extracellular matrix in lungs of mice shortly afterreturn from a 13-day mission in space, i.e. STS-118 68. In a studyof astronauts that assessed soluble adhesion markers 10 days pre-launch, immediately after landing and 2 4 days after ight found dilution of soluble iCAM-1 and E-selectin; soluble P-selectin wasaffected by ight duration 69. In another study of astronauts who ew aboard 10 different shuttle ights found changes in a number of adhesion markers, e.g. CD11a, CD54, soluble ICAM-1 and sol-uble E-selectin 70. The data in this latter study suggested thatspace ight could result in reduced leukocyte endothelial adhesion. In conclusion, our data show aberrations in a variety of immune parameters at 40 days after whole-body 56Fe irradiation. Implications regarding immune defense status and long-term effects remain to bedetermined. More research is de nitely needed on samples obtained during space ight as well as from ground-based studies that include multiple forms of radiation to more closely mimic exposure duringight. A better understanding of the complex actions and interactions of stressors in the space ight environment will increase the chance for effective countermeasure development.
