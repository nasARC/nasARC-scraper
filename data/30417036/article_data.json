In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and di cult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallelsurfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-speci c micro-CT-based nite element analysis to measure sti ness to prescribe force levels that produce the same speci ed level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups ( n56 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain,the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio  4.9; p 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality. 1. Introduction A number of diseases, including osteoporosis ( Bouxsein, 2003a ; Saito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes ( Janghorbani et al., 2007 ;Vestergaard, 2007; Farr and Khosla, 2016 ;Rubin and Patsch, 2016 ), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated bone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions in bone mass ( Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensivepre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments ( Mosekilde, 1995; Ominsky et al., 2011 ). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical properties can be measured ( Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006; Turner and Burr, 1993; Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically sti ness, strength, toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic(repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment ifsuch loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in monotonic loading ( Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008; Nalla et al., 2003). Bio- mechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precisemanner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance e ects that are dicult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test spe- cimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic- loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power ( Brouwers et al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive ndings regarding the role of bone quality. As a result of these challenges, and because of the continuing in- terest in bone quality ( Bouxsein, 2003b ;Seeman and Delmas, 2006), there remains a need to re ne the experimental protocols for bio- mechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for https:doi.org10.1016j.bonr.2018.10.002 Received 9 October 2018; Accepted 17 October 2018Corresponding author at: 5124 Etcheverry Hall, Mailstop 1740, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1740, USA.

Here, we report on a method for cyclic biomechanical testing of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved pre- cision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal experiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect me- chanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or treatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are limited in number. 2. Materials and methods Werst present our new method in detail. Then, to demonstrate utility, we describe results from cyclic testing experiments for three groups ( n56 per group) of L5 mouse vertebrae, comparing results for our new method (referred to as KFEAmethod ) against two existing methods from the literature (referred to as KEXPmethod and FMAX method )(Brouwers et al., 2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998; Haddock et al., 2004; Lambers et al., 2013; McCubbrey et al., 1995). 2.1. Animals Our experiments used L5 vertebrae obtained post-mortem from male C57BL6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) that were in the control groups of various previous studies (unpublished). All original studies, and this study, were approved by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Animal Care  Use Committee, and all experimental testing was conducted at NASA ARC. Ages of the mice ranged from 15 to 18 weeks. After sacri ce, the L1-S1 spinal segment was excised from the mouse with a scalpel via an anterior approach. The L5 vertebra was then se-parated by slicing through the adjacent intervertebral discs, gently cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X,pH 7.4), and stored at 20 C until specimen preparation. 2.2. Specimen preparation Obtaining true plano-parallel surfaces, which is di cult for such small specimens ( Brouwers et al., 2009 ), is important to ensure full contact and thus uniform compression between the specimen surface and loading platens. If plano-parallel surfaces are not achieved,or if the loading platens are not perfectly parallel, local contact can occur over just part of the specimen surface. This introduces unwanted scatter in the mechanical response and perhaps also premature failure. Thus, we developed a detailed method for this aspect of the specimen preparation ( Fig. 1). Each vertebra was aligned inside a 3D-printed (Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es, Eden Prairie, MN), disposable jigwith a metal pin (diameter range 0.91 to 0.99 mm; length of 38 mm) (Fig. 1A) and secured with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The combined jig-bone construct was then positioned in a diamond-sawmicrotome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany). Two parallel cuts were made on the cranial and caudal surfaces under con- stant irrigation to remove only the endplates ( Fig. 1B), preserving the maximum amount of bone tissue. A nal cut through the posterior pedicles released the vertebral body from the jig ( Fig. 1C). 2.3. Quantitative micro-CT imaging After machining, specimens were imaged using quantitative micro- CT (CT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at a 10- m voxel size (55 kV, 109 A, 1000 projections per 180, 500 ms integra- tion time) ( Fig. 2 ). Specimens were returned to the freezer after ima- ging. The micro-CT images of the whole specimen (cortical and trabe- cular compartments) were then analyzed for height, minimum tissuecross-sectional area (minimum value of tissue area at any cross-section, over all cross-sections), and total bone volume fraction (BVTV) (Im- ageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0). Each specimen with cortices removed was then evaluated for trabecular micro-architecture (Scanco EvaluationSoftware v6.0): trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BVTV), number(Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp). 2.4. Calculating specimen-speci c cyclic forces We used a force-control loading protocol, which allows both creep and damage to occur during cyclic loading. However, since the cyclic loading response of bone appears to be determined by the magnitude of the applied strain (as opposed to the magnitude of stress) ( Nalla et al., 2003 ;Keaveny et al., 1994a ;Keaveny et al., 1994b ), our protocol re- quired us to calculate a specimen-speci c level of applied force that would result in the same level of initial apparent strain (calculated overthe entire specimen) for all specimens. Cyclic loading in force control in this way should minimize scatter in the resulting fatigue life despite the heterogeneity in size, shape, and microarchitecture of the mouse ver- tebrae. This protocol required measuring the overall vertebral sti ness before starting the cyclic loading so that the prescribed apparent strains ( minand max) could be converted into specimen-speci c levels of ap- plied force (F minand F max). However, experimentally measuring sti - ness for any bone is challenging due to di erent types of machine compliance errors, which can introduce both xed and random errors (Odgaard et al., 1989 ;Odgaard and Linde, 1991 ;Keaveny et al., 1993; Keaveny et al., 1997 ). The xed errors have implications for external validity, but otherwise do not compromise comparisons within anygiven experiment and are therefore oftentimes acceptable. However, large random errors compromise statistical power, particularly when sample sizes are  10 per group. Thus, to circumvent any errors asso- ciated with machine compliance, we used a computationally derived stiness (K FEA) that was obtained from specimen-speci c, micro-CT- based, linearly elastic, voxel-based nite element analysis. The models used 10- m sized cube voxels, and assumed a nominal value of 10 GPa for the tissue-level (voxel) elastic modulus for all specimens (seeAppendix A for details). The specimen-speci c cyclic forces (F min; Eq. 1 and F max; Eq. 2) were then calculated for each specimen using K FEA, the specimen height (H) as measured from micro-CT, and two assumed nominal values of initial apparent elastic strain ( min 0.05 and max 0.5):  FK H min FEA min (1)  FK H max FEA ma x (2) The assumed value of max 0.5 was chosen empirically by trial and error based on earlier preliminary experiments on 6 mouse ver-tebral specimens. There, we found that the resulting F maxvalue was approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force, whichgenerally placed a specimen in the middle region of its fatigue life. The minimum initial elastic apparent strain value was chosen such that the resulting F minvalues were near 1 N. 2.5. Mechanical testing Within one week after imaging, specimens were thawed again to room temperature and prepared for cyclic loading in uniaxial com- pression to failure. The vertebral body was positioned onto the center of the lower platen of the material testing device (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN). Because obtaining perfectly parallel loading platens can be challenging, the upper platen comprised a spherically-seated platen on a lubricated ball-bearing which allows the platen surface to rotate and mate ush with the sample surface to achieve uniform contact ( Fig. 3); with the pre-load in place, the set screws on the upper platen are locked. We used a compressive pre-load of 1 N, and after theplaten was locked room-temperature saline-solution (Gibco PBS 1X, pH 7.4) was added to the bath until the specimen was fully submerged. The pre-load was then adjusted to the predetermined F min, and then sinusoidal cycles of compression between F minand F maxwere applied atM.M. Pendleton et al. Bone Reports 9 (2018) 165172 166a frequency of 8 Hz until the specimen reached 10 strain, measured via the actuation of the testing device platens. 2.6. Outcome measurements Three plots were produced from each specimen fatigue test to de ne outcome measurements. First, the force-displacement data were plotted for each loading-unloading cycle, from which sti ness was de ned as the secant sti ness, or range of force divided by range of displacement per cycle ( Fig. 4A). Second, the apparent strain per cycle was plotted, and was separated into three curves representing total strain, creepstrain, and damage strain ( Fig. 4B). The total-strain curve was used to nd the number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life (N f) and strain to failure ( f) using the point of intersection between the curve and a 0.5 line o set parallel to a line of best t for the secondary region (Brouwers et al., 2009 ;Bowman et al., 1998). Third, we plotted sti ness per cycle ( Fig. 4C) to identify three variables: elastic sti ness of the specimen (K elastic ), stiness at failure (K f), and rate of sti ness de- gradation. Elastic sti ness was calculated as the average sti ness over  500 cycles centered about the maximum value of sti ness(Kmax), which typically occurred after a few thousand cycles of loading; the sti ness at failure was de ned as the sti ness measured at cycle N f; and the rate of sti ness degradation ( KN) was calculated as the slope of a line that best t the middle 50 of points in the range be- tween K maxand K f. The KN parameter re ected accumulation of fatigue damage, larger values indicating a more rapid accumulation of fatigue damage per loading cycle. In addition to these fatigue parameters, we also calculated an ef- fective elastic tissue modulus (E tissue, in GPa, Eq. 3). This was calculated using both the experimental (K elastic ) and computational (K FEA) assess- ments of sti ness, scaling with respect to the assumed nominal value of the tissue-level modulus of 10 GPa in the nite element analysis:    EK K10 tissueelastic FEA (3) 2.7. Alternative methods for calculating specimen-speci c cyclic forces Two published methods were also implemented to demonstrate Fig. 1. Machining of a parallel-planed vertebral body.

The spinous process is oriented into the jigs shallow well, which is then lled with PMMA (blue) to secure the vertebra.

Bone Reports 9 (2018) 165172 167utility of the new method. For the rstKEXPmethod (Brouwers et al., 2009 ;Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998 ;Haddock et al., 2004 ;Lambers et al., 2013), instead of using the nite element-derived value of sti ness (K FEA), the experimental measurement K EXPwas used. Following literature protocol, K EXPwas found by pre-loading the spe- cimen in compression to 1 N, cycling between 1 and 10 N 20 times, and using the slope from the force-displacement curve of the 20th cycle. All other mechanical testing details were the same as for our new methodexcept for two di erences in the K EXPmethod: 1) the upper platen used was a rigid design (not adjustable); and 2) the cyclic frequency was2 Hz. However, fatigue behavior of bone has been shown to be un- altered for any loading frequency below 15 Hz ( Laerty, 1978;Yamamoto et al., 2006 ). For the second F MAXmethod (McCubbrey et al., 1995 ), F maxwas calculated using the measured strength of the adjacent L4 vertebra, obtained by monotonic compression to failure. The L5 strength was estimated as the product of the L4 strength and the ratio of minimum tissue cross-sectional areas (micro-CT) for the L4 and L5 vertebrae, and Fmaxwas then calculated as 50 of the L5 force (See Appendix B , Table 2 for further details). All other mechanical testing details were the same as our new method. Fig. 3. Experimental test set-up for fatigue test shown with spherically-seated upper platen and specimen after preparation.

B: Strain per cycle was plotted for total strain, creep strain, and damage strain ( Haddock et al., 2004 ). Damage strain was only plotted from the cycle at which sti ness was the greatest (N max) and began to decline.

Statistical analysis The means and standard deviations of all outcome measurements were compared between the new method versus the two literature methods. To compare means, a one-way ANOVA was conducted, with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test applied to evaluate signi cant di erences (atp0.05). To compare standard deviations, a Bartlett test was conducted. Standard deviations were considered signi cantly di erent with a F-ratio  1.0 and p0.05. Also, linear regression was used to compare the relationships between maximum cyclic loading force and log of fatigue life (equivalent to a traditional S-N fatigue curve) be- tween the three methods. All statistics were performed using JMP (v13.0, SAS Institute). 3. Results Of all three methods tested, the new (K FEA) method produced the lowest variation in fatigue life. The mean value of the applied force was the same for all groups (22 N), but the standard deviation was lowest for the new (K FEA) method (  0.77 N), 8-fold and 7-fold lower than the KEXPand F MAXmethods (F-ratio  5.5; p 0.01; Fig. 5 A), respectively. Because of these larger variations in applied force for the literature methods, the fatigue life displayed a negative S-N type relation with the loading force (R2 0.73 both literature methods) but there was no such correlation for the new method (R2 0.07; Fig. 6). Instead, for the new method the fatigue life was approximately uniform across all specimens (5.0  0.2), and its standard deviation was 5-fold and 2-fold lowerthan for the K EXP or F MAX methods, respectively (F-ratio  4.9; p 0.008; Fig. 5A). The new method also provided other measurements related to bone quality, both of which displayed high uniformity across the specimens: the eective tissue elastic modulus, E tissue, was 5.83  0.22 GPa and the strain to (cyclic) failure, f, was 3.20  0.80. Three additional observations were noteworthy. First, compared to the new method, the average fatigue life was lower for the K EXPmethod by 40.9 ( p 0.002) whereas fatigue life did not di er for the F MAX method ( p 0.90; Fig. 5A). Second, the elastic sti ness measured from fatigue testing (K elastic ) was also lower for the K EXPmethod than the FMAX method by 42.1 ( p 0.002), and than the new method by 44.8 ( p 0.001); sti nesses for the F MAXand new methods were not dierent ( p 0.80; Fig. 5B). And third, the standard deviation for stiness was lowest for the new method (F-ratio  4.53; p 0.011; Fig. 5B) compared to the K EXPand F MAX method. The di erence in stiness variation between F MAXand the new method, which both used the spherically-seated platen, shows that large variations in sti ness can still exist even with the use of a pivotable xture, presumably due to variable degrees of machine compliance. 4. Discussion Our new method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae yielded highly reproducible measurements of fatigue life and was suc- cessful, in part, by e ectively controlling for the nominal level of strain applied to these tiny bone specimens. Failure of bone in both static andfatigue loading is largely thought to be strain-controlled ( Nalla et al., 2003 ;Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001 ;Keaveny et al., 1994c ; Schileo et al., 2008 ). To apply a repeatable initial strain to each spe- cimen, a consistent measurement of sti ness must rst be obtained. Our new method utilized specimen-speci c micro-CT-based nite element analyses to measure specimen sti ness and prescribe an individualized cyclic force for each specimen. In turn, these individualized forces re- sulted in a consistent starting level of strain applied to all test speci- mens, and resulted in similar values of fatigue life. By contrast, our implementations of the two literature methods were unable to con- sistently apply the speci ed starting strain value, which produced more scatter in the magnitude of the applied forces and an unintended S-N-like relationship. The reduced level of scatter in fatigue life using this method would be particularly helpful for studies limited to a small sample size, such as in vivo animal experiments, to improve detection in cyclic properties. The consistency of our strain-to-failure results with those from other studies supports the validity of our new approach. While the fatigue lifewill depend on the level of loading, strain-to-failure is emerging as a more uniform outcome across many di erent cyclic loading experi- ments. Our strain-to-failure (mean  SD) value of 3.20  0.80,from cyclic compression testing of mouse vertebrae, is consistent with Fig. 5. A: Specimen-speci c cyclic loading force and number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life for each method. Error bars represent standard deviations.Standard deviation of the cyclic loading force was signicantly lower for the K FEAmethod compared to both other methods ( p 0.01). Standard deviation of the fatigue life was signi cantly lower for the K FEA method compared to both other methods (p 0.01). The mean value for cyclic loading force was the same for all methods. The mean value forcycles to failure for F MAXand K FEAwere the same, however cycles to failure for K EXPwas lower com- pared to these methods ( p 0.01).

Two dif- ferent F-N responses were found for the literature methods; by contrast, fatiguelife was approximately constant for the new method. p 0.05 for regression.M.M. Pendleton et al. Bone Reports 9 (2018) 165172 169cyclic compression results for other species: 3.36  2.13 for human trabecular bone ( Haddock et al., 2004 ), 2.85  0.66 for bovine trabecular bone ( Bowman et al., 1998 ), and 4.19  1.52 for rat whole-bone vertebra ( Brouwers et al., 2009 ). A similar value in cyclic compressive strain-to-failure between these studies and ours might beexpected for two reasons. First, the bone material, primarily the col- lagen component which dominates the plasticity and therefore strain- to-failure of the bone ( Burstein et al., 1975 ), is similar amongst the species listed. And second, others have reported on relatively uniformvalues for the strain-to-failure independent of apparent density, applied loads, or temperature ( Bowman et al., 1998 ;Keaveny et al., 2001; Keaveny et al., 1994c ). While the absolute value of strain to failure will be inuenced by any machine compliance, the general level of agree- ment and small degree of scatter suggests that bone tissue does indeedfail at a narrow range of strain under cyclic loading, and that our protocol was successful in reducing the variation in strain across dif- ferent specimens. Ourndings also indicate that implementing a pivotable loading platen to ensure uniform contact is important for accuracy of results, at least for these small-animal bones. We observed a reduced K elastic and fatigue life for the K EXPmethod compared to the new method, even though the specimens used in both protocols had similar size and mi- croarchitecture ( Appendix B ;Table 1). We attribute these inconsistent results to the rigid platen design used in the K EXPmethod testing. Even with rigorous specimen preparation in place, we found that perfectly plano-parallel loading surfaces on small bones cannot always be achieved. And without an adjustable platen, the load can be localized to an area that comes into contact with the platen rst, producing an ef- fective stress concentration. This localized load can result in reducedstiness and the stress concentration in reduced fatigue life. There are some limitations to this study. First, the bone tissue used in this study was shared tissue, which did not allow for random as- signment of animals across all groups, and thus it is possible specimensdiered across groups. However, the similarity in size and structure of specimen across all groups as per micro-CT analysis ( Appendix B ; Table 1) suggests the only source of appreciable heterogeneity could be in tissue material properties, which is unlikely because the animals were of the same strain, sex, and approximate age. Second, the initial strain values of (  max 0.5) used for our new method may be speci c to this particular protocol, which assumed an e ective tissue modulus of 10 GPa in the nite element analyses. The assumed value was chosen empirically by trial and error on some preliminary test specimens, suchthat the resulting F maxvalues were approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force. To use this method in other animal models,large or small (e.g. rat, bovine, monkey), similar preliminary testing to determine the value of  maxis suggested, particularly if it is suspected that the e ective tissue modulus might di er from mouse vertebrae. We recommend using an elastic strain level that is associated with about half of the ultimate strength. Third, the values of the e ective tissue elastic modulus reported here are speci c to this experiment. Para- meters such as temperature, loading frequency, and use of di erent platens, can all contribute to machine compliance and variation be-tween tests, thus the e ective tissue modulus should not be considered a true material property. Placing an extensometer across the platensdirectly beside the specimen ends can minimize machine compliance eects. However, it is best to use the e ective tissue modulus as arelative measurement to compare between untreated and treated spe- cimens within an experiment, but not across studies (e.g. between mouse and rat bones). Lastly, as with any laboratory-based biomecha- nical testing, the loading con guration does not mimic exact in vivo conditions. Our removal of the endplate and loading via a rigid platenversus loading via intact disc and endplate is a clear limitation. Thus, while our results do not describe expected in vivo behavior, our pro- tocol does produce highly repeatable results, which should help eluci- date changes in bone quality characteristics by aging, disease, or treatment. The main application of our new method is to provide greater sta- tistical power in using small-animal experiments to mechanically assess relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment. A small sample size and scatter associated with the fatigue testing present challenges for detecting statistically signi cant e ects unless those e ects are large. For example, Brouwers et al. ( Brouwers et al., 2009) found a 37.5 di erence in steady-state creep rate and 15.7 di erence in loss of sti ness with zoledronate treatment in an osteoporotic rat model, but could not report a detectable signi cance due to high variation in the data and loss of some samples. Our K EXP method was similar to their method, which produced standard devia- tions in fatigue life (reported as time-to-failure ) up to the same magnitude as the mean value. Our new method should reduce thatrange up to 8-fold. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature protocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen preparation (e.g. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (e.g. spherically- seated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be implemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal vertebrae. That said, our new method is a time intensive process for specimen preparation, micro-CT, image processing, and nite element analysis. However, the extra e ort improves the ability to detect small dierences across treatment groups without using a large number of animals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically when sample sizes are inherently limited (e.g. space ight experi- ments). Thus, use of our new method may improve the ability of futurestudies to elucidate mechanically relevant aspects of bone quality as- sociated with aging, disease, or treatment.

First, the image stack was reoriented to align the specimen with the z-axis (DataViewer v1.5.2.4, Bruker). Second, the reoriented images were thresholded using the Default  Autothreshold algorithm in ImageJ (ImageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0_24). The nal stack was used to build the nite element model. A.1. Finite element analysis To determine the computational sti ness, high-resolution linear nite element analysis was performed. Each 10- m cubic voxel in the images wasM.M. Pendleton et al. Bone Reports 9 (2018) 165172 170converted into an eight-noded brick element to create a nite element model of the entire vertebral body. All bone elements were assigned the same elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material properties: elastic modulus 10 GPa and Poissons ratio of 0.3. These values are based on experimental testing of core samples of trabecular bone from human vertebrae ( Bevill and Keaveny, 2009). A varied modulus based on tissue mineral density and thus micro-CT greyscale was not used in this methodology due to underestimation of apparent modulus using this approach ( Kaynia et al., 2015). Each model was uniaxially compressed to 2 apparent strain, the input was displacement which varied depending on specimen height. Typical models contained approximately 1.5 million elements and were solved using a highly scalable, implicit parallel nite-element framework Olympus (Adams et al., 2004 ) running on a Dell Linux Cluster supercomputer (Stampede, Texas Advanced Computing Center). The outcome was the whole- bone reaction force, which was then used to calculate computational sti ness, K FEA(Eq. 4), by dividing by the input displacement.  KReaction force Input displacementFEA(4) Appendix B Table 1 The K EXPand K FEAmethod specimen structural parameters indicate there were no signi cant di erences in specimen size and shape. There were also no signi cant di erences in the mean or standard deviations (F-ratio  1.65; p 0.20) of computed cyclic force between these two groups. The computed cyclic loading force for K EXPgroup was retrospectively found to demonstrate the di erence in standard deviation of cyclic loading force computed with the K EXPmethod compared to K FEAmethod (F-ratio  10.9; p 0.01). The structural parameters from specimens of the F MAX method are not compared to K EXPand F MAXmethod groups because of a di erence in resolution of these micro-CT scans (20.7 m). However, the stiness and fatigue life measurements are the same for the F MAXand K FEAmethods, which suggest the structural parameters for the F MAXmethod specimens were similar to those used in the K EXPand K FEAmethods.

        "introduction": "A number of diseases, including osteoporosis ( Bouxsein, 2003a ; Saito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes ( Janghorbani et al., 2007 ;Vestergaard, 2007; Farr and Khosla, 2016 ;Rubin and Patsch, 2016 ), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated bone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions in bone mass ( Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensivepre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments ( Mosekilde, 1995; Ominsky et al., 2011 ). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical properties can be measured ( Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006; Turner and Burr, 1993; Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically sti ness, strength, toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic(repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment ifsuch loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in monotonic loading ( Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008; Nalla et al., 2003). Bio- mechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precisemanner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance e ects that are dicult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test spe- cimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic- loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power ( Brouwers et al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive ndings regarding the role of bone quality. As a result of these challenges, and because of the continuing in- terest in bone quality ( Bouxsein, 2003b ;Seeman and Delmas, 2006), there remains a need to re ne the experimental protocols for bio- mechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for https:doi.org10.1016j.bonr.2018.10.002 Received 9 October 2018; Accepted 17 October 2018Corresponding author at: 5124 Etcheverry Hall, Mailstop 1740, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1740, USA.

Here, we report on a method for cyclic biomechanical testing of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved pre- cision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal experiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect me- chanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or treatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are limited in number. 2. Materials and methods Werst present our new method in detail. Then, to demonstrate utility, we describe results from cyclic testing experiments for three groups ( n56 per group) of L5 mouse vertebrae, comparing results for our new method (referred to as KFEAmethod ) against two existing methods from the literature (referred to as KEXPmethod and FMAX method )(Brouwers et al., 2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998; Haddock et al., 2004; Lambers et al., 2013; McCubbrey et al., 1995). 2.1. Animals Our experiments used L5 vertebrae obtained post-mortem from male C57BL6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) that were in the control groups of various previous studies (unpublished). All original studies, and this study, were approved by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Animal Care  Use Committee, and all experimental testing was conducted at NASA ARC. Ages of the mice ranged from 15 to 18 weeks. After sacri ce, the L1-S1 spinal segment was excised from the mouse with a scalpel via an anterior approach. The L5 vertebra was then se-parated by slicing through the adjacent intervertebral discs, gently cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X,pH 7.4), and stored at 20 C until specimen preparation. 2.2. Specimen preparation Obtaining true plano-parallel surfaces, which is di cult for such small specimens ( Brouwers et al., 2009 ), is important to ensure full contact and thus uniform compression between the specimen surface and loading platens. If plano-parallel surfaces are not achieved,or if the loading platens are not perfectly parallel, local contact can occur over just part of the specimen surface. This introduces unwanted scatter in the mechanical response and perhaps also premature failure. Thus, we developed a detailed method for this aspect of the specimen preparation ( Fig. 1). Each vertebra was aligned inside a 3D-printed (Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es, Eden Prairie, MN), disposable jigwith a metal pin (diameter range 0.91 to 0.99 mm; length of 38 mm) (Fig. 1A) and secured with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The combined jig-bone construct was then positioned in a diamond-sawmicrotome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany). Two parallel cuts were made on the cranial and caudal surfaces under con- stant irrigation to remove only the endplates ( Fig. 1B), preserving the maximum amount of bone tissue. A nal cut through the posterior pedicles released the vertebral body from the jig ( Fig. 1C). 2.3. Quantitative micro-CT imaging After machining, specimens were imaged using quantitative micro- CT (CT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at a 10- m voxel size (55 kV, 109 A, 1000 projections per 180, 500 ms integra- tion time) ( Fig. 2 ). Specimens were returned to the freezer after ima- ging. The micro-CT images of the whole specimen (cortical and trabe- cular compartments) were then analyzed for height, minimum tissuecross-sectional area (minimum value of tissue area at any cross-section, over all cross-sections), and total bone volume fraction (BVTV) (Im- ageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0). Each specimen with cortices removed was then evaluated for trabecular micro-architecture (Scanco EvaluationSoftware v6.0): trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BVTV), number(Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp). 2.4. Calculating specimen-speci c cyclic forces We used a force-control loading protocol, which allows both creep and damage to occur during cyclic loading. However, since the cyclic loading response of bone appears to be determined by the magnitude of the applied strain (as opposed to the magnitude of stress) ( Nalla et al., 2003 ;Keaveny et al., 1994a ;Keaveny et al., 1994b ), our protocol re- quired us to calculate a specimen-speci c level of applied force that would result in the same level of initial apparent strain (calculated overthe entire specimen) for all specimens. Cyclic loading in force control in this way should minimize scatter in the resulting fatigue life despite the heterogeneity in size, shape, and microarchitecture of the mouse ver- tebrae. This protocol required measuring the overall vertebral sti ness before starting the cyclic loading so that the prescribed apparent strains ( minand max) could be converted into specimen-speci c levels of ap- plied force (F minand F max). However, experimentally measuring sti - ness for any bone is challenging due to di erent types of machine compliance errors, which can introduce both xed and random errors (Odgaard et al., 1989 ;Odgaard and Linde, 1991 ;Keaveny et al., 1993; Keaveny et al., 1997 ). The xed errors have implications for external validity, but otherwise do not compromise comparisons within anygiven experiment and are therefore oftentimes acceptable. However, large random errors compromise statistical power, particularly when sample sizes are  10 per group. Thus, to circumvent any errors asso- ciated with machine compliance, we used a computationally derived stiness (K FEA) that was obtained from specimen-speci c, micro-CT- based, linearly elastic, voxel-based nite element analysis. The models used 10- m sized cube voxels, and assumed a nominal value of 10 GPa for the tissue-level (voxel) elastic modulus for all specimens (seeAppendix A for details). The specimen-speci c cyclic forces (F min; Eq. 1 and F max; Eq. 2) were then calculated for each specimen using K FEA, the specimen height (H) as measured from micro-CT, and two assumed nominal values of initial apparent elastic strain ( min 0.05 and max 0.5):  FK H min FEA min (1)  FK H max FEA ma x (2) The assumed value of max 0.5 was chosen empirically by trial and error based on earlier preliminary experiments on 6 mouse ver-tebral specimens. There, we found that the resulting F maxvalue was approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force, whichgenerally placed a specimen in the middle region of its fatigue life. The minimum initial elastic apparent strain value was chosen such that the resulting F minvalues were near 1 N. 2.5. Mechanical testing Within one week after imaging, specimens were thawed again to room temperature and prepared for cyclic loading in uniaxial com- pression to failure. The vertebral body was positioned onto the center of the lower platen of the material testing device (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN). Because obtaining perfectly parallel loading platens can be challenging, the upper platen comprised a spherically-seated platen on a lubricated ball-bearing which allows the platen surface to rotate and mate ush with the sample surface to achieve uniform contact ( Fig. 3); with the pre-load in place, the set screws on the upper platen are locked. We used a compressive pre-load of 1 N, and after theplaten was locked room-temperature saline-solution (Gibco PBS 1X, pH 7.4) was added to the bath until the specimen was fully submerged. The pre-load was then adjusted to the predetermined F min, and then sinusoidal cycles of compression between F minand F maxwere applied atM.M. Pendleton et al. Bone Reports 9 (2018) 165172 166a frequency of 8 Hz until the specimen reached 10 strain, measured via the actuation of the testing device platens. 2.6. Outcome measurements Three plots were produced from each specimen fatigue test to de ne outcome measurements. First, the force-displacement data were plotted for each loading-unloading cycle, from which sti ness was de ned as the secant sti ness, or range of force divided by range of displacement per cycle ( Fig. 4A). Second, the apparent strain per cycle was plotted, and was separated into three curves representing total strain, creepstrain, and damage strain ( Fig. 4B). The total-strain curve was used to nd the number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life (N f) and strain to failure ( f) using the point of intersection between the curve and a 0.5 line o set parallel to a line of best t for the secondary region (Brouwers et al., 2009 ;Bowman et al., 1998). Third, we plotted sti ness per cycle ( Fig. 4C) to identify three variables: elastic sti ness of the specimen (K elastic ), stiness at failure (K f), and rate of sti ness de- gradation. Elastic sti ness was calculated as the average sti ness over  500 cycles centered about the maximum value of sti ness(Kmax), which typically occurred after a few thousand cycles of loading; the sti ness at failure was de ned as the sti ness measured at cycle N f; and the rate of sti ness degradation ( KN) was calculated as the slope of a line that best t the middle 50 of points in the range be- tween K maxand K f. The KN parameter re ected accumulation of fatigue damage, larger values indicating a more rapid accumulation of fatigue damage per loading cycle. In addition to these fatigue parameters, we also calculated an ef- fective elastic tissue modulus (E tissue, in GPa, Eq. 3). This was calculated using both the experimental (K elastic ) and computational (K FEA) assess- ments of sti ness, scaling with respect to the assumed nominal value of the tissue-level modulus of 10 GPa in the nite element analysis:    EK K10 tissueelastic FEA (3) 2.7. Alternative methods for calculating specimen-speci c cyclic forces Two published methods were also implemented to demonstrate Fig. 1. Machining of a parallel-planed vertebral body. A: A 3D-printed, disposable, plastic jig was designed to securely grip the specimen during machining.A vertebra is placed into the jig using a snugly t, metal alignment pin (gold) through the vertebral foramen (pin diameter 0.9 1 mm) and sits in a diameter-matched channel. The spinous process is oriented into the jigs shallow well, which is then lled with PMMA (blue) to secure the vertebra. B: Once the PMMA is set, the pin is removed and two plano-parallel cuts (red) through the endplates are made using a diamond-saw microtome (not shown).

For the rstKEXPmethod (Brouwers et al., 2009 ;Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998 ;Haddock et al., 2004 ;Lambers et al., 2013), instead of using the nite element-derived value of sti ness (K FEA), the experimental measurement K EXPwas used. Following literature protocol, K EXPwas found by pre-loading the spe- cimen in compression to 1 N, cycling between 1 and 10 N 20 times, and using the slope from the force-displacement curve of the 20th cycle. All other mechanical testing details were the same as for our new methodexcept for two di erences in the K EXPmethod: 1) the upper platen used was a rigid design (not adjustable); and 2) the cyclic frequency was2 Hz. However, fatigue behavior of bone has been shown to be un- altered for any loading frequency below 15 Hz ( Laerty, 1978;Yamamoto et al., 2006 ). For the second F MAXmethod (McCubbrey et al., 1995 ), F maxwas calculated using the measured strength of the adjacent L4 vertebra, obtained by monotonic compression to failure. The L5 strength was estimated as the product of the L4 strength and the ratio of minimum tissue cross-sectional areas (micro-CT) for the L4 and L5 vertebrae, and Fmaxwas then calculated as 50 of the L5 force (See Appendix B , Table 2 for further details). All other mechanical testing details were the same as our new method. Fig. 3. Experimental test set-up for fatigue test shown with spherically-seated upper platen and specimen after preparation.

A: Force-displacement shown for three cycles as the test progresses; an early cycle, the cycle of maximum sti ness (d maxis displacement of this cycle), and the cycle de ned as failure (d fis displacement of this cycle). B: Strain per cycle was plotted for total strain, creep strain, and damage strain ( Haddock et al., 2004 ). Damage strain was only plotted from the cycle at which sti ness was the greatest (N max) and began to decline. Fatigue life, N f, and strain to failure, f, are found from the total strain curve ( Bowman et al., 1998 ).

Statistical analysis The means and standard deviations of all outcome measurements were compared between the new method versus the two literature methods. To compare means, a one-way ANOVA was conducted, with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test applied to evaluate signi cant di erences (atp0.05). To compare standard deviations, a Bartlett test was conducted. Standard deviations were considered signi cantly di erent with a F-ratio  1.0 and p0.05. Also, linear regression was used to compare the relationships between maximum cyclic loading force and log of fatigue life (equivalent to a traditional S-N fatigue curve) be- tween the three methods.
