Though dependent on the duration and extent of unloading, these reductions in mechanical loading lead to marked skeletal fragility, with reported loss of bone mineral density (BMD) ranging from 10 to 40 15. Thus, there is a need to develop strategies to mitigate bone lossassociated with reduction in mechanical loading. Such strategies would be best informed by a better understanding of the nature of disuse-induced bone loss. Animal models of reduced mechanical loading have been used to characterize bone loss and evaluate interventions designed to prevent the deleterious effects of unloading. These models include hindlimb unloading, cast immobilization, botulinum toxin administration, and nerve injury610. While effective in re ecting the musculoskeletal changes that occur with complete immobi-lization or unloading, these models are limited in their ability to assess musculoskeletal changes due to partial reductions in mechanical loading that occur in many situations. For example,there is an increased risk of fracture associated with muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and stroke 1113, where patients are partially loaded. Furthermore, an animal model that could mimic the musculoskeletal effects of fractional gravity, such as that experienced on the Moon or Mars, could provide insights usefulfor planning future space missions. To address this gap in knowledge, we had previously developed a partial weight-bearing (PWB) mouse model, and demonstrated the degree of skeletal deterioration to be closely related to themagnitude of unloading 14,15. We recently expanded this PWB model to rats, which again showed dose-dependent loss of bone and muscle by varied reductions in weight bearing1619. In thecurrent study, we aimed to extend this work with a comprehen- sive evaluation of the time course of changes in bone density, microarchitecture, and strength following exposure to varied weight-bearing levels in adult rats. We also incorporated histomorphometric measurements to delineate the effects of PWB on bone metabolism at the cellular level. We hypothesized that partial reductions in mechanical loading will lead to proportional, progressive deteriorations in bone density, micro- architecture, and strength driven by increased bone resorption and reduced bone formation. RESULTS In vivo longitudinal assessment of tibial metaphyseal trabecular bone density showed both load- and time-dependent effects of PWB (Fig. 1). The dose-dependent response to unloading was evident as early as 1 week after unloading (test for trend, p 0.0001). In particular, trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) declined by 18 in PWB20 ( p 0.001 vs baseline), 9 in PWB40 ( p 0.001 vs baseline), 9 in PWB70 ( p 0.001 vs baseline), and 5 in PWB100 ( p 0.01 vs baseline). Whereas trabecular vBMD remained stable in the PWB100 group over time, longer exposure to unloading led to progressive declines in trabecular vBMD in all groups, with maintenance of the dose-dependent response at all subsequent timepoints (i.e., 2 and 4 weeks; test for trend, p 0.0001). Notably, we did not observe any plateau in the decline in trabecular vBMD. By 4 weeks after unloading, trabecular vBMD had declined by 34, 24, and 23 from baseline in the PWB20, PWB40, and PWB70 groups, respectively. Unlike trabecular bone density, alterations in cortical bone density at the mid-diaphysis were moderate in most groups.

Also a slight increase in cortical bone density was observed in the PWB40 group at the 2-week (0.9, p0.035 vs baseline) and 4-week (0.9, p0.016 vs baseline) time points. Bone microarchitecture MicroCT imaging revealed that trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femoral metaphysis also deteriorated according to the PWBlevel (Fig. 2a). For example, in the PWB20 group trabecular bone volumetotal volume (Tb.BVTV) as 48 and 39 lower compared to PWB100 after 2 and 4 weeks of unloading, respectively. Further, Tb.BVTV in PWB20 was 40 lower than that of PWB40 andPWB70 at 2 weeks. This decrease in Tb.BVTV was due to both thinning of trabeculae and reduced trabecular number (Fig. 2b). Cortical bone microarchitecture at the femoral diaphysis was notaltered by PWB (Supplementary Table 1).Quantitative histomorphometry Deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture was due in part to a decrease in osteoblast surface, which was 65 lower in PWB20compared to PWB100 after 1 week of unloading. After 4 weeks ofunloading, osteoblast surface of both PWB20 and PWB40 were78 and 63 lower than PWB100, respectively. Osteoclast surfacewas unaffected by PWB (Fig. 3). Consistent with the decrease in osteoblast surface, mineralizing surface was decreased in the PWB groups. At 1 week, mineralizingsurface was 75 and 40 lower in PWB20 and PWB40,respectively, compared to PWB100. This pattern was maintainedwith increased unloading time, such that mineralizing surface was71 and 67 lower in the PWB20 and PWB40 groups, respectively, compared to PWB100 after 4 weeks of unloading. PWB did not alter mineral apposition rate (MAR), though boneformation rate (BFR) tended to be lower, with PWB20 beingsigni cantly lower than PWB100 at the 4-week time point. Unlike alterations in remodeling activity at the trabecular bone, dynamic histomorphometric outcomes were not altered by PWBab 124-60-40-2002040 WeeksTrabecular BMD ( change)     124-6-4-2024 WeeksPWB70PWB100 PWB40 PWB20Cortical BMD ( change)  Fig. 1 Peripheral quantitative computed tomography assessment of proximal tibial metaphysis.

Interestingly, however, periosteal uorochrome labels were absent in rats that under- went PWB20 for 4 weeks, and may indicate inhibition of periosteal bone formation with longer duration unloading.Accordingly, Ps.MAR, Ps.MSBS, or Ps.BFRBS could not be calculated for these animals. Femoral biomechanics Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis revealed modest or no deterioration of functional properties due to PWB (Fig. 4). At 2 weeks, diaphyseal stiffness in PWB20 was lower by 17.4compared to PWB100. At 4 weeks, all PWB groups exhibited lower stiffness; 11.6 in PWB70; 13.2 in PWB40; and 12.1 in PWB20. Estimated modulus was not altered by PWB. DISCUSSION We hypothesized that partial red uctions in mechanical loading would lead to proportional deteriorations in bone mass andstructure in rats, and that de cits would be progressive with unloading duration. We tested this hypothesis by examining changes in bone density, micro architecture, and strength following exposure to varied PWB levels for durations ranging ab 12405101520 WeeksOb.SBS    12405101520 WeeksOc.SBS PWB100 PWB70 PWB40 PWB20 1240.00.51.01.52.02.5 WeeksMAR  m 1240246810 WeeksMSBS  124-0.050.000.050.100.150.20 WeeksBFRBS  m3m2dayPWB100 PWB70 PWB40 PWB20 Fig. 3 Quantitative trabecular histomorphometry results.

Ko et al. 3 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2020) 15 from 1 to 4 weeks. Our results demonstrate dose-dependent and progressive reductions in trabecular vBMD due to PWB, as well as deterioration of trabecular, but not cortical bone microarchitecture. The strength of current study is assessing skeletal changes induced by PWB at multiple time points. In particular, in vivo longitudinal assessment of vBMD by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) overcomes the limitations ofcross-sectional ex vivo outcomes, such as microCT and mechanicaltesting. Increased biological variability in outbred rat strains, which were used in our study, further highlights the advantage of in vivo longitudinal assessment of skeletal changes following PWB.Accordingly, these in vivo measurements revealed a clear dose-dependent response of trabecular bone density to the degree of unloading. Also, rather than reaching a plateau, all PWB regimens led to progressive bone loss for the 4-week duration of the study.Few animal studies have performed long-duration unloading, thus whether bone loss reaches a plateau remains an open question. The progressive nature of the bone loss raises concerns for long-duration space ight in the absence of successful bone-sparing countermeasures. The oral bisphosphonate alendronate attenu- ated the decline in BMD, but potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal intolerance need to be considered 20,21. Also, advanced resistance exercise device mitigated bone loss, butserum markers for bone resorption continued to be elevated22. NASA is planning longer duration missions (perhaps up to 3 years) in the next decades, yet we currently have limited data for skeletalresponses to space ight durations greater than 6 months, as well as safe and effective countermeasures. An extreme case of disuse is seen following spinal cord injury. In these patients, bone loss israpid and extensive, but seems to plateau at 50 bone loss 2 3 years after the injury 5,23. In contrast to observations for the trabecular compartment, cortical bone experienced moderate or no deterioration from PWBin these young adult rats. While cortical BMD measured by pQCTwas signi cantly increased transiently, the increase was modest (1) compared to changes in trabecular BMD. The relatively even spread of cortical BMD compared to trabecular BMD amongdifferent PWB groups suggests the stability of cortical boneoutcomes following PWB. Our prior studies in female C57Bl6J mice also showed robust dose-dependent bone loss in the trabecular compartment, while the deterioration in the corticalcompartment was similar among different PWB groups 15. The greater response in trabecular bone is likely due to its greater surface area than cortical bone24, which allows more basic multicellular units to occur, which then leads to more rapid androbust responses to altered mechanical loading environments25,26. Prior studies in the hindlimb suspension model also show greater loss of trabecular bone compared to cortical bone in rats27. Another explanation is that to observe tissue and functional levelalterations in cortical bone, longer duration of PWB may be needed. The lack of periosteal surface uorochrome labels in only 4-week PWB20 animals suggests that alterations in cortical boneremodeling may only occur following longer duration exposure to PWB, unlike the trabecular bone that was altered as early as 1- week PWB. Disruption in periosteal cortical bone expansion willlikely lead to decrease in the total and cortical bone area, momentof inertia, and ultimately decrease in biomechanical properties. Data from histomophometry suggest that the deterioration of trabecular bone subsequent to PWB appears to be driven by animbalance in trabecular bone remodeling, evidenced by adecrease in osteoblast activity with no changes in osteoclast activity. This observation is consistent with tail suspension studies in rodents that report decreased osteoblast activity followingunloading 28,29. Decrease in osteoblast activity seen in PWB groups is likely due to increased sclerostin expression in osteocytes, which has been observed in unloading studies30,31. Other studies have shown that hindlimb unloading also increases osteoclast activity,secondary to osteocyte apoptosis32, though we did not observe increase in the number of osteoclasts. While this may suggest thateven a slight loading by PWB is suf cient to prevent increased osteoclast activity typically associated with unloading in rodentskeleton, further studies are needed to determine whether the celland molecular mechanisms governing the response to PWB aresimilar to those reported for other models of unloading. A recentstudy demonstrated that disuse-associated skeletal muscletranscriptomic pro le in mice differs between cast immobilization vs microgravity in the International Space Station, suggesting thatdifferent modes of PWBunloading may also deteriorate skeletonvia distinct mechanisms 33. It remains unclear whether similar mechanisms are involved in the response to skeletal overloadingand unloading34. In addition to determining possible mechanisms that may respond differentially to varying degrees of unloading, future workis needed to address the current study s limitations using a single sex and age of rats. Notably, BFRs were higher in female than malemice after 2 weeks of tail suspension 35. Also, 2 weeks of unloading by tail suspension led to larger de cits in both the trabecular and cortical compartments in male than in female rats36. These studies suggest that female rats may perhaps be more resistant tounloading-induced bone loss than males, though this needs to betested in the PWB model. Also, aging rats have been reported torespond less to unloading-induced bone loss 37,38, suggesting that aged rats may be less responsive to PWB-induced bone loss. Despite these limitations, using outbred Wistar rats for our study added strength as the genetic variation is related to humanpopulation3941. In conclusion, this study demonstrates dose-dependent trabe- cular bone loss in rats, following exposure to differing levels ofquadrupedal PWB. The skeletal de cits appear progressive, not reaching a plateau by 4 weeks of PWB. Further elucidatingmechanisms underpinning this dose response may lead to thediscovery of novel mechanostat 42genes that can respond rapidly to alterations in external mechanical unloading environment. METHODS Animals Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing 408  0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22  2 C) room with a 12:12-h light dark cycle. Water and chow were provided ad libitum. Throughout the experiment, rats were assessed daily for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyrin staining around eyes, poor grooming, andor hair loss), harness and jackettting, ability to walk and move across the cage, as well as food and water intake. At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO 2inhalation and hind limbs were harvested. After removing the surrounding soft tissue, the left femur was wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and stored at 20 C for ex vivo microCT analysis and biomechanical testing, whereas the right femur was stored in 70 ethanol at 4 C for dynamic histomorphometry. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the IACUC. In vivo PWB Animals were assigned to one of four groups: normal loading (PWB100), and 70 (PWB70), 40 (PWB40), and 20 (PWB20) of normal loading via quadrupedal suspension. These PWB groups were chosen to mimic gravitational forces on Earth (1 G), moderate arti cial gravity (0.7 G), Mars (0.4 G), and Moon (0.2 G). Animals were assigned to experimental groups based on pre-PWB body weight to ensure similar average and variability in body weight across all groups. Groups were suspended for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n1112group). Rats were assigned to each group to ensure balanced distribution of the body weight across all groups. After 2 days of acclimation in custom cages and jackets, rats were suspended according to their PWB groups. Rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a two-point suspension allowing them to adopt a normalF.C.

Animals were weighed daily in their PWB apparatus and the chain link to the two-point suspension was adjusted if needed to ensure that their achieved unloading level remained constant based on PWB groups. In vivo trabecular and cortical bone density measurement At baseline and weekly thereafter, we assessed trabecular vBMD at theright proximal tibia and cortical vBMD at the tibial mid-diaphysis, usingin vivo pQCT (Stratec, XCT Research SA , Pforzheim, Germany). Scans were performed using a voxel size of 100 m and a scanning beam thickness of 500m. Daily calibration was performed using a manufacturer-supplied hydroxyapatite phantom. Transverse images of right tibia were acquired at5.0, 5.5, 6.0 mm (for total and trabecular vBMD), and at 20 and 20.5 mm (forcortical vBMD) from the proximal tibial plateau. During the scan, rats were under iso urane-induced anesthesia. Longitudinal images were visually inspected, and matched based on the distance from the proximal tibial plateau and shape of the proximal tibial metaphysis and bula to ensure anatomically consistent location for analysis. Scanned slices were analyzed using Stratec software (Stratec XCTAnalysis System, v6.0, Norland Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI), using a standardized analysis to determine cortical (contour mode 1, peel mode 2, outer and inner threshold of 0.650 gcm 3) and trabecular (contour mode 3, peel mode 4, outer threshold of 0.450 gcm3, inner threshold of 0.800 gcm3) vBMD16,43. Ex vivo trabecular and cortical bone analyses Microcomputed tomographic (CT) imaging was performed on the distal metaphysis and mid-diaphysis of the femur, using a high-resolutiondesktop imaging system (CT40, Scanco Medical AG, Brttisellen, Switzer- land) in accordance with the published guidelines for the use of CT in rodents 44. Scans were acquired using a 15 m3isotropic voxel size, 70 kVp and 114 mA peak x-ray tube potential and intensity, 300 ms integrationtime, and were subjected to Gaussian ltration. We determined femoral length by measuring the distance from the femoral head to the distal end of femoral condyles on CT scans. The distal metaphyseal region that weanalyzed began 600 m proximal to the distal growth plate and extended proximally 2.1 mm. Cortical bone morphology was evaluated in the femoral mid-diaphysis in a region that started 55 of the bone lengthbelow the femoral head and extended 1050 m distally. Global thresholdsof 360 and 700 mg HAcm 3were used for evaluation of trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Trabecular bone outcomes included trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BVTV, mm3mm3), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1mm), and separation (mm).Cortical bone outcomes included cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD, mg HAcm 3), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, m), total cross-sectional and cortical bone areas (Tt.Ar, Ct.Ar, mm2), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.ArTt.Ar, ), and the maximum and minimum moments of inertia ( Imaxand Imin,m m4). Femoral stiffness The frozen left femurs were thawed and subjected to three-point bending (Instron 8511 MTS, Instron, Norwood, MA). To determine the femoralstiffness (Nmm 2), maximum moment (Nmm), and failure moment (Nmm), each femur was loaded to failure on the posterior surface at a constant displacement rate of 3 mmmin with the two lower supports spaced 20 mm apart. Force-displacement data were acquired at 100 Hz. Estimatedelastic modulus (MPa) was calculated using the moment of inertia derivedfrom microCT scans 45. Dynamic histomorphometry To examine BFR, calcein (25 mgkg) was injected intraperitoneally at 10and 3 days prior to sacri ce. Longitudinal 5- m thick undecalci ed plastic sections were used to measure static and dynamic parameters in trabecular bone in the distal metaphyseal femur, using OsteoMeasure software (Osteometrics; n5group). For static histomorphometry, osteo- blast (Ob.SBS) and osteoclast surface (Oc.SBS) along the trabecular bonewas measured. For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per bone surface (MSBS, ) and MAR ( mday) were measured on unstained sections to calculate BFR ( m 3m2day) according to ASBMR guidelines46.Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). To assess changes in in vivo trabecular vBMD measured by pQCT, we used a linear mixed model (xed variable: PWB, experimental duration, and their interaction; repeated variable: experimental duration) followed by pairwise compar-isons with Bonferroni correction. Ex vivo outcomes were analyzed byt w o - w a yA N O V Af o l l o w e db yT u k e y s post hoc tests. To examine the dose-dependent nature of the response to PWB, we performed a test for trend 47.
