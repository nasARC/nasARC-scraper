There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression proles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceight. Nine-week-old male C57BL6 mice (n 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Kibo facility on the ISS. The ight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition ( g) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 garticial gravity (g  1 g). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the g group induced signicant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups (p 0.05) that was 64 greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inammation, and metabolic stress were signicantly altered in g mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more signicant changes in regulated protein expression in the g group relative to that in the g  1 ggroup. These data provide evidence that spaceight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that articial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect bloodretinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration.

Introduction Approximately 30 of astronauts on short-term (2 week) Space Shuttle ights and 60 on long-duration (6 month) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity  1. Previous studies of rodents also show that environmental conditions associated with spaceight and simulated microgravity induce alterations in retinal structure and function 24. Retinal damage and degeneration can occur as a result of multiple factors, including aging, ischemia, uctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure. Our previous data from Space Shuttle studies showed a signicant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells of ight mice compared to ground controls  2, which could lead to morphologic changes and impairment of retinal function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those associated with a spaceight environment, in facilitating retinal damage are less studied and remain unclear. Data on the response of biochemical systems to altered gravity is very limited in animal studies  5. Some lines of evidence suggest that one of the mechanisms involved in response to spaceight, including changes in the gravity vector, is likely due to oxidative stress  2,6,7. Studies have shown that exposure to microgravity during spaceights is associated with elevations in oxidative stress and production of lipid peroxidation in both humans and rodents  8,9. However, our knowledge about the duration or dose of microgravity exposure needed to induce oxidative stress or alterations in retinal structure and function is extremely limited. For example, one study has shown that even transient exposure to microgravity produced by parabolic ight can cause alterations in retinal vasculature to occur  1. One means to address the impact of microgravity conditions is through the application of articial gravity (AG) during spaceight. Creating AG by centrifugal force makes it possible to have a partial gravity or Earth-like gravity (1g) control in space, where all other environmental conditions associated with spaceight are present. A newly developed mouse habitat cage unit (HCU) by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been installed in the Centrifuge-equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS  10. This rodent centrifugation capability provides opportunities to compare the effectiveness of AG prescription under spaceight conditions. Since the HCU can reproduce Earth-like gravity, it can be used to test the effectiveness of AG to mitigate the effects of microgravity on physiological systems 11. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of spaceight on oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells and to identify spaceight-induced changes in protein expression proles in mouse ocular tissue. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the application of 1 gAG during spaceight could mitigate any detrimental effects of microgravity on the retina. We hypothesized that spaceight would induce elevations in oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, as well as alter ocular proteins associated with apoptosis, cell repair, inammation and metabolic function. We further hypothesized that the application of 1 gAG would mitigate these changes. 2. Results 2.1. Apoptosis in Retinal Endothelial Cells Following Spaceight Immunocytochemical analysis by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that spaceight conditions induced signicant apoptosis in the retinal endothelial cells (Figure 1A) relative to that in the habitat and vivarium control conditions and in the AG ( g  1 g) condition. Our quantitative assessment revealed that the density of apoptotic cells in the retina was the highest in the g group, and was 64 greater than that in the habitat control group (Figure 1B).Int. J.

The occurrence of lipid peroxidation was evaluated with immunohistochemistry with an antibody against 4-HNE, which is an indicative marker of oxidative damage to the retina (Figure 1C). There were no signicant differences among groups in the level of 4-HNE immunoreactivities (Figure 1D). Int. J. Mol.

Discussion The current study demonstrates that spaceight induces apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells. We also identied spaceight-induced changes in proteomic proles and pathways in the ocular tissue. The results indicate that spaceight induces changes in neuronal structure, cellular organization, mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation and inammation which, in turn, may lead to tissue injury and late neurodegeneration. This study is the rst to investigate the role of AG provided by centrifugation during spaceight as a countermeasure for mitigating putative effects of microgravity on ocular structure and function. In our study, several oxidative stress-related signaling pathways are signicantly altered in the g group, which includes fatty acid -oxidation I, fatty acid activation and -adrenergic pathway. However, we did not nd a signicant change in an oxidative stress marker for lipid peroxidation, 4-HNE when measured two days after splash-down. In our previous space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) study, the level of HNE protein was signicantly elevated in the retina after spaceight compared to controls  2. This is not surprising as these two ight conditions are different. Female C57BL6 mice were own in the STS-135 for 13-day mission, and within 35 h of landing, eyes were removed for analysis. In the current study, male mice were own to the ISS for a 35-day mission, and the mice were euthanized at about 40 h after splashing down. Differences in gender, mission duration and recovery time might contribute to their dynamic stress response. The level of oxidative stress can be affected by their stress reaction to a prolonged ight in space and in the period of re-adaptation to the normal gravity after landing  15. Another possible explanation for the lack of signicant change in 4-HNE in the current study is that spaceight might elicit protective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting some gravity-initiated stress signaling pathway. Of all the proteins signicantly altered by spaceight, the Cap-Gly domain containing linker protein 2 (CLIP2), also known as CLIP-115, was signicantly down-regulated in both g and g  1 g groups. This protein is found predominantly in the CNS, where it likely plays a role in the normal structure and function of nerve cells. Within cells, this protein is thought to regulate cell cytoskeleton function that helps to determine cell shape, size, and movement  1620. Figure 6A illustrates CLIP2 in the network of proteins responsible for cellular assembly and organization, cell signaling and interaction as dened by IPA in response to spaceight.Int. J. Mol.

More detailed description of the legends (squares, circles, etc.) can be found at the Ingenuity Systems website.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018 ,19, 2546 11 of 15 Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) had the highest fold changes in ight mice ( g group) compared to HC. This protein binds to methylated DNA and regulates chromatin structure and transcription  21,22. MECP2 is most abundantly produced in the brain where it is expressed primarily in post-mitotic neurons  23. Previous work has also shown MECP2 mediated epigenetic regulation of senescent endothelial progenitor cells and promoted apoptosis  24. Furthermore, a recent study provides evidence that elevated MECP2 in mice causes neurodegeneration  25. Figure 6B shows the regulative role of MECP2 in a network of proteins that involves cell death and survival. The data from this study indicates that adding 1 gon the ISS is effective in reducing the endothelial cell damage and increasing cellular organization and function compared to the g group. Another study of the same animals used in our present study also showed that 1 gAG served to maintain femur bone density and soleusgastrocnemius muscle mass similar to that in the ground control group, whereas signicant decreases in bone density and muscle mass occurred in the ight mice without centrifuge  10. These studies provide evidence that in-ight AG can mitigate some of the effects of weightlessness during spaceight. Further investigation will be needed to dene the relationship between gravitational dosetime and physiological response by assessing retinal physiological endpoints and function. More rodent centrifugation studies on board the ISS are also needed to provide comprehensive information to compare the effectiveness of the AG prescription in other physiological systems during weightless conditions. 4. Material and Methods 4.1. Spaceight and Mouse Condition Twelve male 9-week old C57BL6 male mice, obtained from a US breeding colony, were launched 18 July 2016, at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a SpaceX-9 rocket for the 35-day MHU-1 mission to the ISS. The animals were housed in the mouse HCU located in the JAXA Kibo facility on the ISS. The 12 ight mice were subdivided into two groups. The rst group of ight mice ( n 6) were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions ( g group), while the second group of ight mice (n 6) were exposed to continuous articial Earth gravity ( g  1 ggroup) while they were in the HCU. AG was achieved through the use of a short-arm centrifuge for the duration of their stay on the ISS. The ight mice were then returned live to Earth and splashed down in the Pacic Ocean on 26 August 2016. It took approximately 40 h for the mice to be recovered in the Pacic Ocean, brought to shore and transported to the testing and processing laboratory located in San Diego, California on 28 August 2016. The spaceight mice were then euthanized and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. Ground control mouse studies were completed in Japan after the return of the ight mice. Control mice (habitat controls, n 6; vivarium controls, n 6) were acquired on 31 August 2016 from a breeding colony in Japan and shipped to the JAXA animal facility in Tsukuba, Japan. HC mice were acclimated to the water lixit system and the same special food bar diet as the space own mice were fed. They were rst housed in the transportation cage unit (TCU) to simulate launch and ight to the ISS, and then placed in the HCUs to simulate the housing conditions experienced by g mice on the ISS. They were again placed in the TCU to simulate the return to Earth ight. The control mouse dissections took place on 3 November 2016. Control mouse eye tissue was then shipped to the US for analysis. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. A detailed description of the ight schedule and mouse information has been previously reported 11. The Loma Linda University (LLU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was consulted, but no protocol was required since only archived frozen and xed tissues were obtained after euthanasia. However, animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Tsukuba (No. 16-048), Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010) on 23 May 2016, JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B) on 2 June 2016 and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1) on 31 May 2016, and the research with vertebrate animals are done in strict accordance with guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018 ,19, 2546 12 of 15 4.2. Dissecting and Preservation of Mouse Eyes after Spaceight Within 2 days of splashing down, mice were euthanized and their eyes were harvested. The posterior half of the right eyecup containing the retina layer, optic disc and a short segment of the optic nerve was placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at80C prior to use. The left eyes were xed in 4 paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. 4.3. Immunohistochemistry Assays and Histology Sixm sections were cut through each eye, and sections were roughly 100 m apart providing 10 sections per eye for analysis. To characterize apoptosis, 5 sections were subjected to a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Parafn-embedded sections were deparafnized in Histo-Clear, then permeabilized in proteinase K solution. Stained sections were evaluated using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (catalog no. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum -Lectin (catalog no: DL-11721, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) at a 1:100 dilution for 30 min at room temperature to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Sections were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted uorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ, USA). TUNEL-positive cells were identied by green uorescence, vascular endothelium were identied with red uorescence. TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identied as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. For quantitative analysis, the total number of TUNEL-positive endothelial cells in the retina were determined in 5 sections of each eye. The area of the retina was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ counting plugin 1.41 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http:rsbweb.nih.govij), and the density proles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic positive cellsmm2. The mean of the density prole measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. Immunouorescence staining for an oxidative damage marker on ocular sections was also performed using an anti-4-HNE antibody. Five sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) at 4C for 2 h followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG uorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. To determine 4-HNE immunoreactivity, uorescence intensity was measured on each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Once the green channel was separated from the red channel in an image, uorescence intensities from the areas of interest were measured using the integraldensity feature in the ImageJ program and data were extracted and averaged within the group. Fluorescence was averaged across 5 retinas per group in retinal nuclear layers. Data were normalized with respect to controls. The values were represented as fold changes over controls. 4.4. Mass Spectrometry Protein expression proles of ocular tissue containing the retina were determined in eighteen mice (n 6group) from three sample groups: g,g  1 g, and HC, using high resolution mass spectrometry. Five micrograms of protein lysate were resolved by a 420 Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The gel was sliced into 24 gel slices that were 2 mm thick for each sample. Gel slices were destained in 50 methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientic, Hampton, NH, USA), 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), followed by reduction in 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (Pierce, Dallas, TX, USA) and alkylation in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were then dehydrated in acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientic), followed by addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modied trypsin (PromegaInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018 ,19, 2546 13 of 15 Corp.) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37C for 1216 h. Peptide products were then acidied in 0.1 formic acid (Pierce). Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) on a 100 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity Ultra Performance LC (UPLC ) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Peptides were eluted using a 30 min gradient from 97:3 to 60:40 buffer A:B ratio. (Buffer A  0.1 formic acid, 0.5 acetonitrile; buffer B  0.1 formic acid, 90 acetonitrile). Eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray (1.9 kV) followed by MSMS analysis using collision-induced dissociation on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientic). MS data were acquired using the Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometry (FTMS) analyzer in prole mode at a resolution of 60,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 mz. MSMS data were acquired for the top 15 peaks from each MS scan using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with a normalized collision energy of 35.0. 4.5. Data Analysis Proteins were identied by searching the UniProtKB database (2017-03 release; restricted to Mus musculus; 81,557 entries) using the Andromeda search engine in MaxQuant (version 1.5.7.4, Max Planck Institute of biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Search parameters were as follows: trypsin digestion with up to three missed cleavages; xed modication of carbamidomethyl of cysteine; variable modications of oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus; rst search set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance and the main search was set to 3 ppm; selected label-free quantitation with iBAQ with a minimum ratio of 1. A contaminants database was used for the rst search to identify commonly identied contaminants. The MaxQuant iBAQ values for each sample were converted to relative iBAQ (riBAQ) intensities by dividing the iBAQ intensity for each protein by the sum of all iBAQ intensities for all proteins identied in the sample. The median of all relative iBAQ intensities for each sample was then used to normalize between the samples. The adjusted riBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.5.6.0, Max Planck Institute of biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Perseus was used to log 2transform the data and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. Non-parametric MannWhitney U tests were used to compare habitat control with the g and g  1 ggroups separately. The p-values were corrected by BenjaminiHochberg to account for multiple testing. Fold changes were also calculated for each comparison. Proteins that were signicant by the FDR-adjusted p-value  0.05 and that had a fold change greater than 2 were considered to be differentially expressed. The heat maps were generated using the Euclidean distance metric and the data was standardized by the mean and standard deviation before performing hierarchical clustering with pheatmap R package (maintained by Raivo Kolde, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Volcano plots were generated using R. These proteins were then analyzed using the IPA pathway analysis. 4.6. Statistical Analysis The results obtained from all experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukeys post hoc multiple-comparison test (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). The signicance level was set at p 0.05. Data are shown as mean standard error (SEM). 5. Conclusions The current data demonstrate that spaceight induces apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells of the retina. Such changes to vasculature endothelial cells could serve to impair barrier function of the BRB and compromise the delity of intraocular pressure regulation. Study results also show acute changes in the protein expression prole of space-own and centrifuged mouse retina. Diverse spaceight-induced alterations in protein-expression proles suggest broader changes inInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018 ,19, 2546 14 of 15 eye structure and function. If such alterations occur in the eyes of astronauts, these changes could contribute to acute and sustained modications in astronauts visual acuity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the possible mechanism(s) by which changes in protein-expression proles are mediated and their structural and functional consequences.

        "introduction": "Approximately 30 of astronauts on short-term (2 week) Space Shuttle ights and 60 on long-duration (6 month) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity  1. Previous studies of rodents also show that environmental conditions associated with spaceight and simulated microgravity induce alterations in retinal structure and function 24. Retinal damage and degeneration can occur as a result of multiple factors, including aging, ischemia, uctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure. Our previous data from Space Shuttle studies showed a signicant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells of ight mice compared to ground controls  2, which could lead to morphologic changes and impairment of retinal function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those associated with a spaceight environment, in facilitating retinal damage are less studied and remain unclear. Data on the response of biochemical systems to altered gravity is very limited in animal studies  5. Some lines of evidence suggest that one of the mechanisms involved in response to spaceight, including changes in the gravity vector, is likely due to oxidative stress  2,6,7. Studies have shown that exposure to microgravity during spaceights is associated with elevations in oxidative stress and production of lipid peroxidation in both humans and rodents  8,9. However, our knowledge about the duration or dose of microgravity exposure needed to induce oxidative stress or alterations in retinal structure and function is extremely limited. For example, one study has shown that even transient exposure to microgravity produced by parabolic ight can cause alterations in retinal vasculature to occur  1. One means to address the impact of microgravity conditions is through the application of articial gravity (AG) during spaceight. Creating AG by centrifugal force makes it possible to have a partial gravity or Earth-like gravity (1g) control in space, where all other environmental conditions associated with spaceight are present. A newly developed mouse habitat cage unit (HCU) by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been installed in the Centrifuge-equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS  10. This rodent centrifugation capability provides opportunities to compare the effectiveness of AG prescription under spaceight conditions. Since the HCU can reproduce Earth-like gravity, it can be used to test the effectiveness of AG to mitigate the effects of microgravity on physiological systems 11. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of spaceight on oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells and to identify spaceight-induced changes in protein expression proles in mouse ocular tissue. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the application of 1 gAG during spaceight could mitigate any detrimental effects of microgravity on the retina. We hypothesized that spaceight would induce elevations in oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, as well as alter ocular proteins associated with apoptosis, cell repair, inammation and metabolic function. We further hypothesized that the application of 1 gAG would mitigate these changes. 2.",
        "conclusion": "s The current data demonstrate that spaceight induces apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells of the retina. Such changes to vasculature endothelial cells could serve to impair barrier function of the BRB and compromise the delity of intraocular pressure regulation. Study results also show acute changes in the protein expression prole of space-own and centrifuged mouse retina. Diverse spaceight-induced alterations in protein-expression proles suggest broader changes inInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2018 ,19, 2546 14 of 15 eye structure and function. If such alterations occur in the eyes of astronauts, these changes could contribute to acute and sustained modications in astronauts visual acuity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the possible mechanism(s) by which changes in protein-expression proles are mediated and their structural and functional consequences.
