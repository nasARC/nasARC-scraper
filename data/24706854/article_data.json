Ca2signaling Yellow Cameleon Two Pore Channel 1 Plants are constantly tailoring their responses to current environmental conditions via a complex array of chemical regulators that integrate developmental and physiological pro- grams across the plant body. Environmental stimuli are often highly localized in nature, but the subsequent plant response is often elicited throughout the entire organism. For example, soil is a highly heterogeneous environment and the root encounters stimuli that are presented in a patchy manner. Thus, factors in- cluding dry or waterlogged regions of the soil, variations in the osmotic environment, and stresses such as elevated levels of salt are all likely to be encountered locally by individual root tips, but the information may have to be acted on by the plant as a whole. In animals, long-range signaling to integrate activities across the organism occurs through rapid ionicmembrane potential- driven signaling through the nervous system in addition to op- erating via long-distance chemical signaling. Plants have also been proposed to possess a rapid, systemic communication net- work, potentially mediated through signals ranging from changes in membrane potentialion fluxes (1 3) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4, 5) to altered hydraulics in the vascu- lature (6). Even so, the molecular mechanisms behind rapid, systemic signaling in plants and whether such signals indeed carry regulatory information remains largely unknown. Sugges- tions that Ca2channels play a role in signals that occlude sieve tube elements (7), or that mediate systemic electrical signaling (2) in response to remote wounding, highlight Ca2-dependent signaling events as a strong candidate for mediating some of these long-range responses. Similarly, cooling of roots elicits Ca2 increases in the shoot within minutes (8), suggesting systemicsignals can elicit Ca2-dependent responses at distal sites within the plant. However, despite extensive characterization of Ca2 signals (reviewed in ref. 9), their roles in a possible plant-wide communication network remain poorly understood. Therefore, to visualize how Ca2might act in local and systemic signaling, we generated Arabidopsis plants expressing the highly sensitive, GFP-based, cytoplasmic Ca2sensor YCNano-65 (10). We ob- served that a range of abiotic stresses including H 2O2, touch, NaCl, and cold shock triggered Ca2increases at the point of application. However, NaCl also elicited a Ca2increase that moved away from the point of stress application. Propagation of this Ca2increase was associated with subsequent systemic changes in gene expression. We also report that this salt stress- induced long-distance Ca2wave is dependent on the activity of the ion channel protein Two Pore Channel 1 (TPC1), which also appears to contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance. Results Changes in Cytoplasmic Ca2Occur in Response to Abiotic Stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in a thin layer of gel and a500m500m region of the gel covering the root apex was removed to allow localized application of treatments to the root tip ( Materials and Methods ). Consistent with previous studies (reviewed in ref. 9), when a range of abiotic stresses including touch, cold, ROS (H 2O2), and NaCl were locally applied to the root tip, we detected rapid and transient Ca2increases at the site of treatment that showed stimulus-specific spatialtemporal characteristics ( Fig. S1 andMovies S1 S4). However, we observed that, among these treatments, NaCl treatment also led to a propa- gating Ca2increase moving away from the point of stress appli- cation (Figs. 1 and 2 and Movie S5 ). Treatment with 200 mM sorbitol (osmotic control for th e 100 mM NaCl stress) did not elicit Ca2changes under these conditions ( Fig. S1 E), suggesting such Ca2changes were being specifically elicited by the salt stress. Significance This work documents a previously unreported plant-wide sig- naling system based on the rapid, long-distance transmission of Ca2waves. In the root these waves move through the cortical and endodermal cell layers at speeds of up to 400 ms, i.e., traversing several cells per second. This Ca2wave system correlates with the triggering of molecular responses in distant parts of the plant upon perception of localized (salt) stress. Such propagating Ca2waves provide a new mechanism for the rapid integration of activities throughout the plant body.

Local application of salt stress to the root tip induced an increase in Ca2that propagated shootward from the site of NaCl stim- ulation (Figs. 1 and 2). This salt stress-induced elevation in Ca2 was largely constrained to the cortical and endodermal cell layers (Fig. 1 AandB). Thus, changes were not seen in the epidermal cells even though this tissue is known to generate stimulus- evoked Ca2elevations (e.g., ref. 11). In addition, when a lateral root tip was stimulated, a Ca2wave also moved through the cortexendodermis, traveling to the main root and then bidirectionally rootward and shootward (Fig. 1 Band Movie S6). This Ca2increase eventually traversed to the aerial part of the plant, moving through the hypocotyl ( Fig. S2 andMovie S7). Quantitative analysis of the timing of Ca2increase in various regions along the root (Fig. 2 A) coupled with kymo- graph-based measurements of rates of Ca2increase (Fig. 2 C) indicated that the wave front of these Ca2changes moved at a steady 395.7 27.8 ms (SD) (Fig. 2 AandC), taking 1 min to traverse the entire length of the root system and 2 min to spread across the entire length of the Arabidopsis seedlings used in this study.Root Tip Salt Stress Triggers Systemic Molecular Responses in Shoot Tissue. We next used a battery of molecular markers (Table 1) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to ask whether the long-distance Ca2increase we observed in response to this root-applied NaCl stress was accompanied by a systemic shoot response (Fig. 3 A). As expected, increased transcript levels of stress-related genes such as RAB18 ,DREB2A ,TCH2 ,a n d ZAT12 , and the salt stress response genes SOS1 andCBL10 (12) were detectable in the directly salt-stressed root tissues within 12 min of treatment (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 A). These rapidly in- duced genes showed subsequent oscillations in levels, sharing a fall at 10 min and subsequent increase over the 60 min of analysis (Fig. S3 A). However, local salt treatment of the root tip also led to an increase in transcript abundance of a number of stress markers in the distant aerial parts of the plant. For example, by 10 min RAB18 ,DREB2A ,TCH2 ,TCH3 ,PIP2;3 ,ZAT12 ,LOX3 , andSID2 levels were significantly increased in the shoot ( P 0.05, ttest; Fig. 3 AandFig. S3 B). These genes generally showed a peak in transcript level at 10 min that had begun to fall by 30  60 min. Induction of markers such as SOS1 ,SOS2CIPK4 ,SOS3 CBL4 , and CBL10 was significant only after 30 min. The vacu- olar channel TPC1 was notable in showing a rapid, transient Fig. 1.

In contrast, NaCl treatment led to an equally rapid but sustained decrease in TPC1 transcript levels in the salt-stressed roots. Direct salt movement, either within the growth medium or within the plant, was too slow to explain the induction of such systemic responses in the aerial plant parts. Thus, fluorescein (a small molecule dye) took 2 min to diffuse only 300 m through the matrix of the growth medium ( Fig. S4 AandB), and there was no detectable increase in Na content of shoots, measured via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, after 10 min of local root NaCl treatment ( Fig. S4 C). Therefore, the propagation of the Ca2wave and induction of systemic molecular res- ponses are unlikely to reflect direct response to salt that had moved from the site of application either through the gel or within the plant. To test whether the transcriptional changes elicited by local salt stress of the root required the Ca2wave, we asked whether pharmacological inhibitors that blocked transmission of the Ca2 wave also blocked distal transcriptional responses. Local appli- cation of LaCl 3(putative plasma-membrane Ca2-channel blocker) or Ruthenium Red (RuRed) (putatively targeting internal Ca2 release) between the sites of stress application and Ca2signal detection (Fig. 4 A) inhibited transmission of the Ca2signal past this point (Fig. 4). However, if the NaCl stress was applied shootward of the LaCl 3treatment, the propagation of the Ca2 wave still moved shootward at 397.5 42.1 ms (SEM) ( P 0.05, ttest) from the point of NaCl application ( Fig. S5 ). This result indicates that the position of the LaCl 3, rather than simply its presence in the root system, appeared to be a key factor in blocking the progression of the Ca2wave. The increase in transcript abundance of genes such as TCH2 andZAT12 (Fig. 3 C)o r TCH3 ,PIP2;3 ,LOX3 , and TPC1 (Fig. S6) seen at 10 min in the shoot in response to root tip NaCl stress was suppressed by the local LaCl 3treatment applied shootward of the site of NaCl application. In contrast, induction of RAB18 andDREB2A (Fig. S6 )o r SDI2 (Fig. 3 C) was left unaffected. These observations are consistent with a requirement for the Ca2 wave in the triggering of at least part of the systemic molecular regulation seen in response to local root salt stress. The effect of La3application on its own is an important control for these experiments. Although we observed that LaCl 3 alone could alter transcript levels of some genes (Fig. 3 BandFig. S7), this treatment did not significantly affect the levels of the molecular markers at the 10-min time point used for these experiments (Fig. 3 BandFig. S7 ). A prolonged suppression of LOX3 andSOS1 transcript levels were a notable exception, and so responses of these markers in La3inhibitor experiments must be made with caution ( Fig. S7 ). Long-Distance Ca2Signaling Is Dependent on the Vacuolar TWO PORE CHANNEL 1. In animals, Ca2waves are often supported by processes involving calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) (13). The slow vacuolar (SV) channel is a large-conductance, voltage-dependent ion channel (reviewed in ref. 14) that is per- meable to Ca2(15) and has been proposed to mediate plantCICR (15 17), although this idea remains controversial (14). The Arabidopsis SV channel is encoded by a single gene, TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1 ) (18). In Arabidopsis , loss-of-func- tion mutants of TPC1 show disrupted stomatal signaling and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation of germination (18) and the gain- of-function fou2 mutant exhibits developmental effects thought to be linked to aberrant defense signaling (19). We therefore tested the hypothesis that the SV channel might play a role in sustaining the salt-induced Ca2wave using tpc1mutants. Previous work measuring Ca2changes in a TPC1 knockout expressing the luminescent Ca2indicator aequorin indicated no clear dis- ruption of a range of stress-induced Ca2changes (20). Consis- tent with this report, we found that salt stress-induced Ca2 elevations were not grossly altered in tpc1-2 (a protein null) (18) when monitored at the direct site of stress application, although they did exhibit a slightly delayed onset ( Fig. S1 DandE, and Movie S8 ). However, the speed of transmission of the Ca2wave intpc1-2 was significantly reduced to 15.5 1.9ms (SD) ( P 0.05, ttest; Fig. 2).Table 1. qPCR markers for abiotic stress used in this study Gene Stresssignalrole RAB18 ABA (38) DREB2A Droughtcold (39) TCH2 ,TCH3 Mechanical (40, 41) PIP2;3 Water stress (42) Zat12 ROS (5) SOS1 ,SOS2(CIPK24) ,SOS3 (CBL4) ,CBL10 Salt (43 45) TPC1 Ion transport (14, 18) LOX3 JAwounding (46) SID2 Salicylate (47) JA, jasmonate.

PNAS April 29, 2014 vol. 111 no. 17 6499 PLANT BIOLOGY SEE COMMENTARYTWO PORE CHANNEL 1 Mutants Affect Transcript Levels of Stress- Related Genes. qPCR analysis of our panel of stress markers showed that, in response to root tip NaCl treatment, shoot in- duction of genes such as TCH2 and ZAT12 was significantly attenuated in the tpc1-2 mutant (Fig. 3 CandFig. S8 ), a pattern confirmed in the knockdown lines tpc1-1 (36 reduction in TPC1 transcript; Fig. S8 ) and tpc1-4 (21 reduction in TPC1 transcript; Fig. S8 ). Interestingly, La3treatment had a complex interaction with NaCl induction of TCH2 in these backgrounds, leading to a partial recovery of transcript levels. This observation suggests that feedback between vacuolar and plasma mem- brane Ca2fluxes is likely an important element in the tran- scriptional response of at least TCH2 to salt stress. qPCR analysis also indicated that TPC1 is the most rapidly systemically up-regulated gene we tested, with 10-fold increase in transcript abundance in the shoot within 1 2 min of root salt stress ( P0.05, ttest; Fig. 3 AandFig. S3 C). This observation raises the possibility of a self-reinforcing signaling system with Ca2wave-related rapid induction of TPC1 amplifying and ex- tending subsequent Ca2responses. Consistent with such ideas, markers that were suppressed in tpc1 mutants such as ZAT12 andTCH2 (Fig. 3 CandFig. S8 ) were constitutively increased above WT in a TPC1 overexpression line ( Fig. S9 A). This up- regulation of transcript levels was suppressed by La3treatment (Fig. S9 B), suggesting altered control of Ca2homeostasis may linkTPC1 levels to transcriptional regulation. Consistent with these ideas, the speed of propagation of the Ca2wave in the TPC1 overexpression line was 679 73ms, 1.7-fold faster than WT but was still sensitive to inhibition by LaCl 3(Fig. 3 D). TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 Expression Level Affects Whole-Plant Salt Sensitivity. The overexpression line TPC1 10.21 (18), which showed 73- to 130-fold increase in transcript level ( Fig. S9 C), was more resistant to NaCl stress based on seedling growth and chlorophyll levels after growth on 100 mM NaCl for 7 d (Fig. 3E). Thus, the up-regulation of systemic molecular changes and faster Ca2wave signaling observed in the TPC1 transgenic lines correlate with alterations in whole-plant salt stress resistance. Discussion In plants, environmental stimuli including wounding or heat stress have been proposed to elicit long-distance signaling in- volving mechanisms such as plasma membrane depolarization and self-propagating increases of ROS (1 5, 21, 22). Our results suggest Ca2-dependent signaling also plays a role in this process of systemic signaling in response to salt stress. Thus, local salt stress of the root tip leads to the spreading of a Ca2wave that propagates preferentially through cortical and endodermal cells to distal shoot tissues (Figs. 1 and 2). This Ca2wave moves with a velocity of 400ms (Fig. 2 A), i.e., traversing several cells persecond. Local treatment with LaCl 3that blocked the trans- mission of the Ca2wave (Fig. 4) also inhibited subsequent sys- temic molecular responses (Fig. 3 CandFig. S6 ). Thus, these patterns of transmission and response are consistent with a model in which the rapidly propagating Ca2wave serves as a long-dis- tance signal that triggers systemic responses to local salt stress of the root system. It is important to note that such La3treatment itself could inhibit transcription of some genes ( Fig. S7 ). This observation implies that a basal level of La3-sensitive (likely Ca2-dependent) signaling between root and shoot may be re- quired to sustain nonstimulated levels of some genes. In addi- tion, although such blocking of the Ca2wave could inhibit systemic induction of stress markers such as TCH2 ,ZAT12 (Fig. 3C),TCH3 , and PIP2;3 (Fig. S6 ) in response to localized salt stress treatment, a similar treatment could not block up-regula- tion of RAB18 andDREB2A (Fig. S6 ). These observations sug- gest additional systemic signals are likely operating in parallel to the Ca2wave. Role of the Vacuolar Ion Channel TPC1 in Propagation of the Ca2 Wave. We found that the rate of propagation of the systemic Ca2 wave was reduced from 395.7 27.8 ms in WT to 15.5 1.9 ms in the loss-of-function tpc1-2 mutant (Fig. 2), representing a25-fold reduction in speed. TPC1 encodes the vacuolar SV ion channel that is sensitive to cytosolic Ca2levels and to those in the lumen of the vacuole (23), suggesting feedback regulation of this channel by alterations in cytosolic and vacuolar Ca2 levels could play a role in Ca2wave propagation. However, it remains unclear whether TPC1 acts itself as a vacuolar Ca2 release channel that sustains the Ca2wave (14). Thus, TPC1 could be operating more indirectly, through, e.g., altering tono- plast potential and so gating an independent vacuolar Ca2 conductance. However, effects of tpc1mutants on both reducing Ca2changes and inhibiting the induction of systemic molecular responses such as increase in TCH2 andZAT12 transcript abun- dance (Fig. 3 CandFig. S8 ) are very similar to those of blocking Ca2changes with La3. These observations are consistent with TPC1 actively maintaining the propagation of the Ca2 wave through an effect on Ca2fluxes. In support of these ideas, theTPC1 overexpression line showed Ca2wave propagation rates that were 1.7-fold faster than WT (Fig. 3 D). The overexpression line also exhibited constitutive elevation of marker genes such as TCH2 andZAT12 that appear normally dependent for up-reg- ulation on the Ca2wave elicited by local salt stress. This con- stitutive induction was inhibited by the channel blocker La3 (Fig. S9 B), suggesting a link between transcriptional changes modulated by TPC1 and Ca2-mediated events. Taken together, these results support a model in which local NaCl stress elicits a long-distance Ca2wave-mediated signaling system that trig- gers systemic molecular responses. Furthermore, comparison of WT, tpc1-2 , and plants overexpressing TPC1 grown on 100 mM NaCl-containing plates indicated that, by 7 d, the overexpression line was significantly more resistant to this level of salt stress as inferred from plant size and chlorophyll content (Fig. 3 E). These observations suggest that the Ca2wave system mediated by TPC1 may also be contributing to the whole-plant resistance to salt stress. However, it is important to note that, due to the extended time of salt stress needed to elicit this visible phenotype, the link between Ca2wave signaling and this whole-plant physiological response must remain tentative. qPCR analysis (Fig. 3 AandFig. S3 C) indicated that TPC1 was the most rapidly up-regulated gene we tested in the shoot, showing up to 10-fold increase in transcript abundance within 12 min of root salt stress. We also observed rapid changes in transcript abundance for some other genes in qPCR analyses, such as rapid down-regulation of TCH2 (Fig. S3 ). The timescale of these alterations suggest either extremely fast changes in transcription or rapid alterations in mRNA stabilityturnover elicited by the salt stress signal. In addition to such rapid alterations in transcript level, post- transcriptional regulation is also likely playing a role in modulating Fig. 4. Effect of Ca2channel blockers on salt-induced Ca2waves.

This idea is because this channel is ubiquitously expressed across tissue types, yet the root Ca2wave is restricted to the cortex and endodermal cell layers (Fig. 1). Although it remains to be discovered whether the action of TPC1 and transmission of the Ca2wave is related to other proposed systemic signaling systems such as membrane depolarization (2) or ROS-dependent events (5), TPC1 has been proposed to be posttranslationally regulated by ROS (24). This observation raises the possibility of a point of interaction be- tween the ROS and Ca2-dependent systemic signaling systems. Transmission of systemic ROS responses is thought to be Ca2- independent (5), suggesting a model where Ca2changes could lie downstream of ROS. However, the relationship between ROS and Ca2is complex with Ca2triggering ROS production (25) and ROS eliciting Ca2increases (25, 26). Thus, the re- lationship of TPC1, Ca2wave, and ROS is an important area for future study. TPC1 is found in all land plants (14) and the function of this channel appears to be conserved at least between monocots to dicots (27). This ubiquity of TPC1 suggests a possibly widespread and general function of this channel in plant biology, hinting at the potentially widespread nature of Ca2wave signaling in plants. Materials and Methods Plant Growth and Transformation. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia 0 and the mutants used in this study ( tpc1-1 ,tpc1-2 ,tpc1-4 , OxTPC1TPC1 10.21 ) were surface sterilized and germinated on half-strength Epstein s medium containing 10 mM sucrose and 0.5 (wtvol) phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7, as described previously (28). Plants were grown under a long-day (LD) cycle of 16 h light8 h dark at 22 C. Ten-day-old seedlings were transplanted to SunshineRedi-earth soil (Sun Gro Horticul- ture) and were grown under cool white fluorescent lights (75 88Em2s1) at 22 C under the LD light cycle. Plant transformation was carried out es- sentially as in ref. 29 using midlogarithmic cultures ( A6000.6) of Agro- bacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the binary vector YCNano- 65pEarleyGage100 that encoded YCNano-65 (see below for details of this vector), resuspended in half strength Epstein s medium containing 5 (wtvol) sucrose and 0.05 (volvol) Silwet-L77 (Lehle Seeds). Transformed plants were covered with a clear plastic cover overnight. A second trans- formation on the same plants was carried out 1 wk later. Plants were then grown under LD conditions until seed set and harvest. Selection of trans- formants expressing YCNano-65 was made using an epifluorescence dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ1500 Stereoscope) using a GFP filter set (excitation, 450490 nm; dichroic mirror, 495 nm; emission, 500 550 nm). Multiple in- dependent lines were selected, selfed, and the T2 or greater generation used for subsequent imaging. All results were confirmed on multiple in- dependent lines. All YCNano-65 expressing lines used showed equivalent growth and development to their untransformed counterparts. tpc1-1 ,tpc1-2 , tpc1-4 , and OxTPC1 were kindly provided by Edgar Peiter (Martin-Luther- Universitt Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany) and Dale Sanders (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK). Abiotic Stress and Inhibitor Treatment. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the YCNano-65 FRET sensor were grown on a thin layer of gel ( 2 mm thick) containing half-strength Epstein s medium supplemented with 0.5 (wtvol) phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM sucrose, under LD conditions at 22 C for 6 d. A small window ( 500 m500 m) was removed from the gel at the tip of the root to expose the apical 50m of the root to allow precise application of 100 mM NaCl (salt stress), 100 MH 2O2(ROS stress), chilled medium at 4 C (cold stress), or 200 mM D-sorbitol (control equivalent to the osmotic stress from 100 mM NaCl). Touch stress was applied using contact with a glass micropipette as previously described (30). For inhibitor treat- ments, a small window ( 500 m500 m) was also made in the gel in the middle region of the root, shootward of the root tip window. Ten microliters of 25 M LaCl 3(putative plasma membrane channel blocker) or RuRed (putative antagonist of internal sites of Ca2release) were added either in the root tip gel window or to the middle gel window (see diagram in Fig. 4 A) 30 min before salt treatment of the root tip as indicated for each experi- ment. Arabidopsis seedlings pretreated with pharmaceutical inhibitors were kept in a humid Petri dish until confocal imaging. Confocal Image Analysis of in Vivo Ca2Changes. Stable transgenic lines expressing YCNano-65 under the control of CaMV35S promoter were grownunder sterile conditions in a thin layer ( 2 mm) of half-strength Epstein s medium containing 0.5 (wtvol) phytagel and 10 mM sucrose on a no. 1.5 cover glass (24 50 mm; Fisher Scientific) for 6 d under LD conditions at 22 C. Ratio confocal imaging of Ca2changes was then performed with an LSM510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a Plan- Neofluar 10 0.3 or 20 0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective as described pre- viously (31). The YCNano-65 Ca2sensor was excited with the 458-nm line of an argon laser and CFP (462 505 nm) and cpVenus (FRET, 526 537 nm) emission detected using a 458-nm primary dichroic mirror and the micro- scope system s Meta detector. Ca2levels were determined from the ratio of the Ca2-dependent FRET signal to the CFP signal normalized to the FRET-to- CFP ratio from before stress treatment. Quantitative analysis of Ca2dy- namics (from the ratiometric Ca2-FRET signal) was performed using iVision- Mac (version 4.0.16) image-processing software (BioVision Technologies) with a custom script for the calculation of the ratiometric FRET signal from region of interests (ROIs). Briefly, quantitative analysis of YCNano-65 data (e.g., Fig. 2) was calculated from the ROIs (4 ml o n g 51.2 m wide, with 1,280 pixels of data) scanned along the root, generating 116 sequential data points covering a total of 464 m of root length per image. The extracted quantitative ratio numerical data from the sequential confocal images were displayed as a pseudocolor-coded matrix using MultiExperiment Viewer MeV software (version 10.2; ref. 32). Ratio values were converted to absolute Ca2cyt(in nanomolar concen- tration) using the equation Ca2C138KdRRmin RmaxRC1381n(33), where Ris the experimentally monitored FRETCFP ratio, nis the Hill coefficient (1.6), and the Kdfor Ca2is 64.8 nM (10). The ratio from Ca2-saturated reporter ( Rmax, 5.33 1.43) was determined by incubating samples with 50 (volvol) ethanol and the minimum ratio ( Rmin, 0.40 0.04) by incubation with 10 mM EGTA according to ref. 31. The values derived from this in vivo calibration should be taken as approximations due to difficulties inherent in obtaining a robust Rmaxand Rminvalue and uncertainty in the precise Kdof YCNano-65 in the plant cytoplasmic environment. Monitoring Diffusion Through the Gel. To test for the rate of small-molecule diffusion through the growth medium gel, 50 M fluorescein was added to a window at the tip of the root as for NaCl local treatment. Fluorescein movement was then monitored with the LSM510 using a 20 0.75 Plan- Apochromat objective. Fluorescein signal was excited with the 488-nm line of the argon laser and emission collected using an HFT 488543633 dichroic beam splitter and 500- to 530-nm emission filter. Images were acquired every 4 s for 270 s. Cloning of the YCNano-65 FRET Sensor. For the 35S:YCNano-65 Ca2FRET sensor construct, the YCNano-65 FRET cassette fragment from YCNano-65 pcDNA3.1 plasmid (a kind gift from Takeharu Nagai, Osaka University, Osaka) (10) was isolated by digesting with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pENTR11 gateway entry vector (Invitrogen). The resulting YCNano-65pENTR11 construct was introduced into the plant binary vector pEarleyGate100 (34) by Gateway cloning using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer s instructions. pEarlyGate 100 has a CaMV35S promoter to drive constitutive expression in plant. The resulting YCNano- 65pEarleyGate100 construct was v erified by HindIII endonuclease di- gestion patterns and DNA sequencing and transformed into Agro- bacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using electroporation. Salt Treatment, Total RNA Isolation, and qPCR Analysis. For qPCR analysis, the root tip region of 10-d-old seedlings of WT Col_0, tpc1-1 ,tpc1-2 ,tpc1-4 , OxTPC1 was covered with an 5-mm strip of KimWipe wetted with growth medium and acclimated for at least 1 h. Approximately 20 L of medium with or without 100 mM NaCl or 25 ML a C l 3was then added to the KimWipe strip to achieve precise local application as described for each experiment. For the LaCl 3blockade experiments described for Fig. 3, the 25M LaCl 3was added to a similar KimWipe strip covering the midregion of the root 30 min before salt stress was applied at the root tip. Root and shoot samples were harvested and stored at 80 C. Total RNA was then isolated from tissue samples (50 200 mg) using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer s instructions. Residual genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment using the TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer s instructions. Total RNA (1 2g) was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA in a 40- L reaction (25 50 ng of total RNA per L) with the SuperScriptIII first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). qPCR analysis was performed using a Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR System, and analysis was performed with the MxPro qPCR software (Stratagene). The Arabidopsis UBQ10 gene was used as an internal reference for standardization as described previously (35). Choi et al. PNAS April 29, 2014 vol. 111 no. 17 6501 PLANT BIOLOGY SEE COMMENTARYcDNA proportional to 10 ng of starting total RNA was combined with 200 nM of each primer and 7.5 Lo f2 EvaGreen qPCR master mixed with ROX passive reference dye (Biotium) in a final volume of 15 L. qPCRs were performed in a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 15 min at 95 C, and 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 C, 15 s at 58 C, and 15 s at 65 C, and 1 cycle of dissociation from 58 to 95 C with 0.5 increments. Quantitation of expression of the marker genes was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method as described previously (36). The qPCR primers used are described in Table S1 . Quantification of Sodium Accumulation. Plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl applied to the root tip as described above and then dissected into root and shoot tissue ( 50 mg). The root tissues were rinsed in deionized water to remove contaminating NaCl from the medium, and then each sample (root and shoot) was digested in 0.6 mL of nitric acid in a glass test tube at 120 C for 2 h followed by further digestion in 0.4 mL of 60 (volvol) HClO 4at 150180 C for an additional 2 h or until total sample volume became 0.5 mL. The resulting tissue samples were cooled to room temperature and di- luted in 5 mL of Nanopure water, and sodium concentration was determined using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) according to the manufacturer si n - struction. Results of Na level in parts per million (in milligrams per liter) was calculated and converted to milligrams per kilogram fresh weight (F.W) using the following equation:Na level mg kg F:Wresulting Na mg L1,000  total sample volume LC138total sample fresh weight g: Chlorophyll Content Assay. Aerial parts of these seedlings (30 100 mg F.W) were harvested for chlorophyll determination as described previously (37) with slight modification. Briefly, tissue samples in 0.5 mL of 80 (volvol) acetone were homogenized using a GENOGRINDER 2000 (SPEX SamplePrep, LLC) at 1,200 strokes per min for 10 min. The resulting lysates were centri- fuged at 4 C, 1,690 gfor 15 min. The clear supernatant was collected, and chlorophyll content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 652 nm and applying the following equation: Total chlorophyll mg gA6521,000 34:5C138 V1,000 W:Vextract volume mL  and Wfresh weight g: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
