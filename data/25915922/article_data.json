Introduction The lytic vacuole in vegetative cells may occupy more 90 of the cell volume. This essential or- ganelle is highly dynamic and has critical functions in cellular homeostasis, maintenance of turgor, storage and recycling  13. Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant mem- brane fluctuations and transient and highly mobile structures such as trans-vacuolar strands(TVS), sheets and bulbs  4,5. TVS are dynamic tubules delimited by the tonoplast that are thought to distribute cytoplasmic contents, including organelles between opposite sides of the cortical cytoskeleton  6. In root hairs of Hydrocharis dubia , TVS form predomindantly along the tip growing axis and are thought to deliver cytosolic components to the growing tip  7,8. Many TVS sorrounding the phragmoplast were also observed in tobacco BY-2 cells during cell division  9. The actin cytoskeleton has been localized to TVS  10, and disruption of actin fila- ments results in their dissasembly  11.

The current model for TVS formation is that the actomyosin system regulates TVS forma- tion and dynamics  13,14. Bulbs are spherical structures of diameters between 1 and 10 m that are highly dynamic in the lumen of the vacuole. These membrane structures are associated with the outer tonoplast membrane or transvacuolar strands and contain cytoplasmic structures, even organelles, be- tween the folded membranes  5,15. Imaging by electron microscopy has indicated that bulbs are formed by multiple layers of tonoplast membranes, which explains the increased intensity of bulbs in fluorescently labeled tonoplasts  15. Bulbs are present in LVs of cotyledon and leaf epidermis and their numbers decrease during cotyledon expansion  15, and leaf maturation 16. Bulbs have been visualized by fluorescencence microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) fu- sions with several tonoplast proteins and in multiple cell types. For example, in vacuoles of to- bacco leaves, bulbs were observed when GFP-VAM3SYP22  17 or a GFP fusion with the phosphate transporter NPT2  18 were transiently expressed. In Arabidopsis, bulbs have been detected in epidermis of the root elongation zone and the leaf, sepal bundle sheet, and germi- nating pollen of stably transformed plants expressing either GFP-AtVAM3  5, TPK1-GFP 19,20, TIP1;1-GFP  21, or FP fusions with other tonoplast intrinsic proteins  16,22. In ad- dition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate sensor 2xFYVE-YFP also labels the bulbs  23. These structures are not simply the result of ectopic expression of FP fusions because they were also detected in Arabidopsis WT plants by electron microscopy  15. It was recently proposed that bulbs may form by dimerization of GFP or YFP tags when fused to tonoplast markers, and that some of these structures may be artifacts from this interaction  24. Two types of struc- tures were distinguished: bulbs associated with high levels of expression of GFP fusions thatshowed 3 or more fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the tonoplast, and intra-vacuolar spherical structures (IVSPs) present in transgenic lines in which the intensity of fluorescence was only two fold that of the tonoplast and were visualized with a non-dimeriz-ing GFP molecule. This distinction was most dramatic in the root elongation zone where onlyvery bright bulbs were observed, but it was more complex in other tissues, such as the cotyle- don epidermis, where both types of structures existed  24. Two hypotheses for the function of bulbs have been proposed. Bulbs may act as reservoirs of membranes for cell expansion or they may represent the first step for proteolysis of tonoplast proteins inside the vacuole  15,19. Only two mutants with bulb phenotypes have been identi- fied thus far. These are sgr2-1 andvti11 , and in both cases these mutants show a reduced num- ber of bulbs  23. SGR2 encodes a protein similar to phospholipase A1, and sgr2mutants have an abnormal vacuole morphology with multiple small vacuole-like structures and abnormal distribution of the vacuole and the cytosol in shoot endodermal cells  25. VTI11 encodes a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein that mediates membrane fusion between pre-vacuolar compartments and the vacuole  26, 27. VTI11 is also involved in vacuole homotypic fusion, and vti11 mutant alleles have highly frag- mented vacuoles  28. Given the highly abnormal vacuole morphology of these two mutants, it is unclear if the lack of bulbs is a direct or indirect effect of the loss of SGR2 and VTI11. Here we describe the phenotype of regulator of bulb biogenesis1 (rbb1-1 ), a novel mutant in Arabidopsis that displays increased numbers of bulbs in otherwise normal vacuoles. We showthatrbb1-1 mutants make fewer TVS than the parental control. We propose the hypothesis that RBB1 may function in TVS formation and that increased bulb accumulation in rbb1-1 may result from impaired formation of TVS. In addition, we show that the differential labelingof bulbs between rbb1-1 and the parental line does not result from abnormal trafficking to the vacuole. We also identified RBB1 locus, which encodes a large plant-specific protein of unknown function.

SALK_095160, SALK_067590 and SALK_074387 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR. pUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1 was generated by Gateway clon-ing (Invitrogen). Briefly, the TIP1;1 CDS was amplified from Col-0 cDNA by PCR and theamplicon was introduced into pENTR-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A RFP-TIP1;1 expression clone was generated by recombination with pUBN-RFP  31 using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). The promoter of the resulting construct was substituted with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596bp) from pNIGEL07 (Geldner et al 2009) to generate pUBQ10 ::RFP-TIP1;1 . The RBB1 ::3xYpet- RBB1 andRBB1 ::RBB1-3xYpet constructs were generated by a Recombineering-based gene tag- ging system  32 using the JAtY76M24 clone and the primers listed in S1 Table . After introduc- ing 3xYpet, the JAtY clone was shortened by homologous recombination using delleft and RB-amp primers ( S1 Table ). This resulted in a fragment of the chromosomal region contain- ing 12.8 kb upstream of start codon of RBB1 and up to 5 kb downstream from the stop codon. These constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101 and then transformed intoCol-0 wild type plants via floral dip  33. Seeds were plated on AGM (0.5X MS media and 1 sucrose) with 4 g L GelRite. For light- grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated for 4 days in the dark to break dormancy and then in-cubated at 22C under a 16 h light photoperiod. For dark-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated in the dark and then incubated at 22C while covered in aluminum foil. Chemical Stocks and Treatments C834 (ID 6982834) was from Chembridge, Brefeldin A from Sigma and Lysotracker Red and FM4-64 from Invitrogen. All chemicals were dissolved in 100 DMSO and all treatments were carried out with 4-day old seedlings, unless specified. BFA treatment was done in liquid AGM containing 75 M BFA and for 3 h. C834 treatment was done with 3-d-old seedlings in solid AGM-GelRite supplemented with 55 M C834 for 48 hours as described  29. For staining, seedlings were incubated in liquid AGM containing 2 M Lysotracker Red for 2 h or 5 M FM4-64 for 5 min. Microscopy A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for all imaging experiments. A 40x water objec- tive (1.1 N.A.) was used to image embryos and roots. A 20x objective (0.8 N.A.) was used to image hypocotyls and cotyledons. The excitationemission wavelengths during acquisitionwere 488 nm492 570 nm for GFP and Ypet, 561 nm588 696 nm for mCherry and RFP, 514 nm588 700 nm for FM4-64, and 561 nm566-690 nm for Lysotracker red. To count the num- ber of TVS, seedlings were imaged using a large pinhole to generate 600 m thick optical sec- tions for hypocotyls and 102 m sections for cotyledons. A 40X objective was used and image zoom was kept at 0.6. Epidermal cells within the bottom half of the hypocotyl, but excluding the root-shoot junction, were used for TVS counting in hypocotyls. Epidermal cells from theadaxial side were used for cotyledons. TVS were counted in each cell from the collected images. RT-PCR Total mRNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (NEB).cDNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) and was used a template for RBB1 Regulates of Vacuole Morphology PLOS ONE  DOI:10.1371journal.pone.0125621 April 27, 2015 32 0RT-PCR. Oligo sequences used for PCR are shown in S2 Table and 30 cycles were used for all reactions. Map-based cloning and genome sequencing A mapping population was generated from a cross between rbb1-1 and the L erwild type back- ground, and segregating homozygous rbb1-1 mutants were identified based on the bulb pheno- type. Two Single Sequence Length Polymorphism (SSLP) markers  34 co-segregated with the rbb1-1 phenotype and placed the mutation in Chromosome 5. For SNP detection, 12 homozy- gous F 3families from 1 backcross to the parental line were selected based on the bulb pheno- type and 500 seedlings per family were used to generate DNA libraries. Samples weresequenced in an Illumina HiSeq sequencer as 100 bp reads at BGI (formerly Beijing GenomicsInstitute). The expected genome coverage was 35X. Data analysis was carried out at the Bioin- formatics Consulting and Service Core at North Carolina State University as follows. Sequence reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using bowtie2 and variant calls were made usingsamtools mpileup. Variants were filtered for those located within TAIR10 genes and data was exported to a spreadsheet. Only SNPs located between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD in Chromosome 5 were analyzed further. From these, mutations that were originally present inthe parental line were identified from the sequencing of an unrelated mutant from the same mutagenesis screen. In addition, mutations in introns or UTRs, silent mutations and mutations unlikely to result from EMS mutagenesis were discarded. Western Blot Total proteins were extracted from 7 day-old seedlings. Samples were homogenized in 50mMHEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 8 sucrose, 1mM DTT and proteinase inhibitors (Com-plete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics) in a chilled mortar. The homogenates were spun at 5,000g for 10 min at 4C and the supernatant was filtered through 3 layers of miracloth. For membrane protein fractions (P100), filtered total proteins were spun at 100,000g for 1 h at 4Cand the pellet was resuspended in buffer. Protein concentration was quantified by the Bradfordassay. For immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1, 8 g of proteins were loaded in a NuPAGE 3 8 Tris-Acetate gel (Life Technologies) following manufacturer instructions. The following anti- bodies were used: anti-GFP (Thermo MA5-15256), anti-cFBase (Agrisera AS04043), anti-H ATPase (Agrisera AS07260) and anti-calreticulin  35. Peroxidase-Conjugated Goat Anti- Mouse IgG (Thermo 32430) or peroxidase-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit (Thermo 32460) anti- bodies were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescencewith Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ system (Syngene) for image capture. Signal was quantified using the GeneTools image analysis software (Syngene). Results GFP-TIP2;1 labels excess bulbs in regulator of bulb biogenesis1 We recently carried out a screen for mutants in tonoplast protein trafficking and vacuole bio- genesis and characterized the function of the VTI11 SNARE protein and phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion  28. During the course of this work, we identified a mutant in which the tono- plast protein GFP-TIP2;1 labeled many vacuolar bulbs and it was named regulator of bulb bio- genesis1-1 (rbb1-1) . In the parental line, the GFP-TIP2;1 protein labels the tonoplast and very few bulbs in root epidermis and cortex and the epidermis of hypocotyls, cotyledons and rosette leaves ( Fig 1A 1D)16,28,36. In the rbb1-1 mutant, GFP-TIP2;1 also labels the tonoplast, RBB1 Regulates of Vacuole Morphology PLOS ONE  DOI:10.1371journal.pone.0125621 April 27, 2015 42 0and the size and morphology of the vacuole appeared normal. However, many more bulbs were evident as bright sub-vacuolar structures in multiple tissues ( Fig 1E 1H). In hypocotyls, bulbs were observed consistently in many cells in the epidermis and cortex ( Fig 1E ). Bulbs were also apparent in high numbers in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves of rbb1-1 (Fig 1F and 1H ). Vacuolar bulbs were detected in roots ( Fig 1G ), but this phenotype was variable amongst different seed stocks and was not characterized further. The variability in the root phenotype may be due to root-specific modifying factors that segregate in the population. Nomajor defects in plant morphology were detected in rbb1-1 homozygous plants ( S1 Fig ). Fig 1. regulator of bulb biogenesis1 contains many bulbs in many cell types.

Four-day-old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize morphology of the vacuole in the epidermis of hypocotyl (a, e) and cotyledon (b, f), and in root epidermis and cortex (c, g).

Immunoblot of GFP-TIP2;1 accumulation in the parental line and rbb1-1 using antibodies against GFP ( -GFP) and Calreticulin ( -CRT) as loading control. doi:10.1371journal.pone.0125621.g001 RBB1 Regulates of Vacuole Morphology PLOS ONE  DOI:10.1371journal.pone.0125621 April 27, 2015 52 0Sequencing demonstrated that the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene is intact in rbb1-1 and consequently, the bulb phenotype is not related to a mutation in the GFP-TIP2;1 protein sequence. TIP1;1-YFP is often found in vacuolar bulbs  16,23,37. In order to determine if the rbb1-1 bulbs accumulate TIP1;1 in a similar manner, we introduced a RFP-TIP1;1 fusion in the rbb1-1 mutant background. In the parental line, RFP-TIP1;1 localized to the tonoplast, and labeled very few bulbs in roots and hypocotyls ( Fig 1I 1K). RFP-TIP1;1 co-localized with GFP-TIP2;1 in the tonoplast and the bulbs when the two markers were co-expressed in rbb1-1 (Fig 1L 1N). It was previously proposed that vacuolar bulbs are involved in the degradation of membrane proteins  19 and that bulbs may form as a response to overexpression of dimer-type FP  24. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be caused by enhanced accumulation of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 by Western blot. No significant differences in GFP-TIP2;1 protein accumulation were detected between rbb1-1 and the parental control, in- dicating that the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 is not related to differences in protein ac- cumulation or stability ( Fig 1O andS1C Fig ). These results overall indicate that, independent on the nature of the bulbs in rbb1-1 , the RBB1 locus is required to prevent the formation or ac- cumulation of bulbs in the vacuole. In order to compare rbb1-1 bulbs with the IVSPs and bulbs previously described  24, we measured the maximum intensity values for bulb membranes in rbb1-1 . As shown in S2 Fig , maximum intensity values for the bulbs in the parental line are 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher than the outer tonoplast in cotyledons and hypocotyls, respectively. In contrast, rbb1-1 bulbs have 2 fold higher intensity than the tonoplast in hypocotyl, and 3.5-fold higher in cotyledons. There- fore, rbb1-1 bulbs would fit the description of both IVSPs and bulbs  24. Moreover, given the fact that the GFP-TIP2;1 protein levels in rbb1-1 mutants is similar to the parental line, we con- clude that the rbb1-1 bulbs are not simply the result of increased GFP dimerization in the mu- tant. However, we can not discard the possibility that GFP dimerization acts as an enhancer of therbb1 phenotype. Given the complexity of these structures, we will refer to them here simply as bulbs. The vacuole membrane in many plant species constantly remodels with the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVS). We then hypothesized that the mechanisms involved in bulb for- mation and the dynamics of TVS may be related and that RBB1 may have a role in TVS forma- tion. In order to test this possibility, we compared the number of TVS between the parental line and rbb1-1 mutants. In contrast to the parental line, which shows 4.06  0.39 TVS per cell in cotyledon epidermis, rbb1-1 mutants have only 1.40  0.16 ( Fig 2A andS3A and S3B Fig ). Therefore, rbb1-1 has 3-fold fewer TVS than the parental line, and this result provides sup- port to a hypothesis that RBB1 is involved in TVS formation. This phenotype was also observed in the hypocotyls of light- and dark-grown seedlings. Thus, the parental line showed an averageof 2.2  0.2 TVS per cell in the light and 1.75  0.21 in the dark, while the rbb1-1 mutant had 1.25  0.15 and 1.03  0.19, respectively ( Fig 2B ). This indicates that rbb1-1 had a 40 reduc- tion in the number of TVS per cell in hypocotyls in both light and dark-grown seedlings. Theseresults point towards important roles of RBB1 in the remodeling of the vacuole that generateseither bulbs or TVS. The rbb1-1 phenotype can be detected 3 days post-germination In order to characterize the developmental progression of the bulb phenotype in rbb1-1 , vacu- oles were visualized at different times during seed germination ( Fig 3A 3J). No bulbs were ob- served in PSVs of imbibed seeds or 1 d after incubation at 22C in either the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 3A, 3B, 3F and 3G ). Bulbs were first detected at day 2 post-germination in both the parental line and rbb1-1 when the large lytic vacuole is already established  16. The bulbs were RBB1 Regulates of Vacuole Morphology PLOS ONE  DOI:10.1371journal.pone.0125621 April 27, 2015 62 0very transient in the parental line and very few were observed at 3 days or later. In contrast, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 continued to increase at days 3 and 4. These results indicate that RBB1 function may be important after day 3, but not during the early stages of germination. One proposed function of the bulbs is to contribute membranes during cell expansion  15. This prompted us to investigate whether the rbb1-1 phenotype was affected by conditions that promoted cell expansion such as the elongation of hypocotyls in the dark. To this end, vacuolesfrom the hypocotyl epidermis of parental and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown either in the light or the dark were imaged in the microscope, and bulbs were counted. While the parental control seedlings grown in the light contain 0.10  0.03 bulbs per 10 3m2(Fig 3K and 3O ), the rbb1-1 mutant contains 1.00  0.16 ( Fig 3L and 3O ). Therefore, the rbb1-1 mutant contains 10 fold more bulbs per area in hypocotyls when compared to the parental control grown under normal light conditions. Next we analyzed the phenotype of rbb1-1 mutants in the dark. In contrast to the dark-grown parental control, which contains 0.07  0.01 bulbs per 103m2(Fig 3M and 3O ), the dark-grown rbb1-1 mutant showed 1.18  0.09 bulbs per 103m2(Fig 3N and 3O), or a 16-fold increase. Thus, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 was higher than the parental under both light treatments, but light availability did not significantly alter the rbb1-1 pheno- type. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs would enhance the elongation rate of dark-grown rbb1-1 seedlings, but no differences in hypocotyl length were detected between the mutant and the parental control at 3 or 5 d ( S3C Fig ). Furthermore, cell elongation was not affected, as we could not detect significant differences in cell size between the wild type andrbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the dark ( S3D Fig ). Finally, if the RBB1 is responsible for the bulb and TVS phenotypes of rbb1-1 , we expected a similar developmental progression, which can be tested by quantification of TVS during germi-nation. TVS could not clearly be detected before day 2, and no significant difference was de- tected at day 2 between wild type and rbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the light ( Fig 3P ) However, the number of TVS was reduced by 28 in rbb1-1 when compared to the wild type.

Therefore, the appearance of the bulb pheno- type at days 3 and 4 correlates well with the reduction of TVS numbers in rbb1-1 . GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is not altered in rbb1-1 The increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be the result of abnormal GFP-TIP2;1 protein trafficking to the vacuole. To test this hypothesis, two inhibitors for tonoplast protein traffick-ing were used. Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits a Golgi-dependent pathway for tonoplast proteins in hypocotyls and C834 inhibits a Golgi-independent traffic of GFP-TIP2;1 to the tonoplast  29. We treated the GFP-TIP2;1 (parental control), the TIP1;1-YFP line and the rbb1-1 mutant Fig 3. Developmental progression of the rbb1-1 phenotype and effects from light.

The fusion proteins localized to the tonoplast (GFP-TIP2;1) or tonoplast and bulbs ( rbb1-1 and TIP1;1-YFP) in the DMSO control as expected ( Fig 4A 4C). In BFA-treated cells, the GFP-TIP2;1 localization was unchanged in the parental control ( Fig 4D )o rrbb1-1 (Fig 4E ), indicating that the trafficking of this protein was still BFA-insensitive. In contrast and consistent with previous reports  29, the TIP1;1-YFP marker line displayed large and bright aggregates in the presence of BFA ( Fig 4F ). Next we test- ed sensitivity to C834. GFP-TIP2;1 localized to the tonoplast and did not co-localize with theER marker mCherry-HDEL in neither the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 4G 4I and 4M 4O). In contrast, GFP-TIP2;1 co-localized with the ER marker in C834-treated roots of the parental line ( Fig 4J 4L) and rbb1-1 (Fig 4P 4R). Therefore, we conclude that GFP-TIP2;1 traffics in a similar pathway in rbb1-1 and the parental line, at least early in the secretory pathway, and that the bulb-localization of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 does not appear to be the result of altered traf- ficking to the vacuole.

In order to identify theRBB1 locus, we used a combination of map-based cloning and whole genome sequencing. TheRBB1 gene mapped to a region of 2.2Mb in Chromosome 5 between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD. Using Illumina whole-genome sequencing, we identified nucleotide variants in the rbb1-1 mutant genome between these two markers. From those, only two SNPs located within gene coding sequences and corresponding to EMS-type non-silent mutations were detected, in At5g38540 andAt5g40450 . In order to determine which gene corresponded to the RBB1 locus, we identified Salk T-DNA insertion alleles  38 for both candidate genes. Only one T-DNA line, SALK_095160, for At5g38540 was available, but no homozygote plants could be recovered. Heterozygous plants were crossed to rbb1-1 and the vacuole phenotype of F 1seedlings grown in the dark was analyzed. Out of 27 F 1seedlings, none showed the rbb1-1 bulb phenotype indi- cating that RBB1 was unlikely to correspond to At5g38540 . We obtained two SALK T-DNA al- leles for At5g40450 (Fig 5A ). However, one of the T-DNA lines, SALK_067590, had a complex transgene insertion and could not be used. We used RT-PCR to determine if At5g40450 was ex- pressed in SALK_074387. The expression of the full length At5g40450 was disrupted in SALK_074387 ( Fig 5B ), and therefore, this was a good mutant allele to test for the bulb pheno- type. However, it is unclear if this allele is a complete loss of function allele because partial tran- scripts can be detected by RT-PCR. We named this allele rbb1-2 . To determine if RBB1 isAt5g40450 , a complementation test between rbb1-1 andrbb1-2 was carried out. F 1seedlings from a cross between rbb1-1 and homozygous rbb1-2 were incubated in the dark and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for the bulb phenotype. As shown in Fig 5E, the double heterozygote F 1plants display the rbb1 phenotype and indicate the lack of com- plementation between the two mutant alleles. We were unable to confirm this result in the F 2 population as the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene was consistently silenced in the segregating popula-tion whenever the SALK insertion was present. This result is consistent with highly silencedtransgenes in SALK insertion lines  39. To confirm the identity of RBB1 , we visualized the vac- uole morphology of rbb1-2 mutants with Lysotracker Red, a fluorescent dye that stains acidic organelles including plant vacuoles  40 and the tonoplast membrane  41,42(S4 Fig ). This ex- periment could only be carried out in cotyledons from light-grown seedlings as penetration of fluorescent dyes in hypocotyls is very poor. Similar to the reduced number of bulbs in the GFP-TIP2;1 line, bulbs were rarely detected in wild type Col-0 cotyledons ( Fig 5F andS1 Movie ). On the contrary, the rbb1-2 mutant allele showed a similar bulb phenotype as the rbb1-1 mutant with 4 5 vacuolar bulbs per cell in these cells ( Fig 5G andS2 Movie ). This phe- notype also segregated as 14 and therefore rbb1-2 is likely to be recessive. These results con- firmed that the RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450 and that the bulb phenotype may be detected in the absence of the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene. At5g40450 encodes a large protein of 2,890 amino acids. The mutation in rbb1-1 is a CT nucleotide substitution that results in an A1070V substitution in the predicted protein se-quence. BLASTp analysis in NCBI identified only two proteins with protein similarity covering at least 40 of the RBB1 protein sequence, CARUB_v10003962mg from Capsella rubella and EUTSA_v10027617mg from Eutrema salsugineum . All other hits (40) show high similarity to a 75 amino acid region at the C terminus of RBB1. Remarkably, no significant similarity was found outside of plant taxa using BLASTp, which indicates that RBB1 is a plant-specific pro- tein. In addition, no specific domain hits were detected using the Conserved Domain Databasesearch function in NCBI  43, but regions of similarity to three multi-domain structures were detected. Only two proteins were identified with significant similarity to RBB1 in C.rubella RBB1 Regulates of Vacuole Morphology PLOS ONE  DOI:10.1371journal.pone.0125621 April 27, 2015 10  20Fig 5.

RBB1 belongs to the putative Plant Model Organism Orthologous Group APK_ORTHOMCL5144, which includes genes from Rice, Poplar, Sorghum, Maize, and Bra- chypodium ( http:rice.plantbiology.msu.educgi-binortholog_group_apk.pl ). This group is also supported by gene family clustering of orthologous genes in Phytozome ( www.phytozome. net)44. The putative orthologs also encode very large proteins (up to 3,715 aa). One of the putative orthologs, Ricinus communis gene 29917.t000066, contains a 32 amino acid region that is 32 identical to the microtubule-associated protein futsch in Drosophila melanogaster . These results overall indicate that RBB1 is a novel plant-specific protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the spatial and temporal expression of RBB1 , the accumulation of RBB1 transcripts was analyzed by RT-PCR in Col-0 wild type plants. RBB1 accumulated at similar levels in 4- and 7-day-old light-grown seedlings, and in rosette leaves and inflorescences (Fig 5H ). These results are consistent with publicly available databases for At5g40450 . Accord- ing to Arabidopsis eFP browser  45,RBB1 is expressed in leaves and roots of both seedlings and mature plants, flowers and all stages of embryo development. Seedlings treated for 12 h with ABA, heat, cold and osmotic stress have decreased levels of RBB1 transcripts  45,46. In contrast, 3 h treatment with photosystem II inhibitor N-octyl-3-nitro-2,4,6-trihydroxybenza-mide (PNO8) or the brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole 220 resulted in a 2-fold induction of RBB1 47. These results indicate that RBB1 may have important functions in multiple developmental stages. The RBB1 transcript accumulation was also analyzed in the pa- rental line and rbb1-1 , but no differences in the expression level were detected ( Fig 5B ). There- fore, the rbb1-1 mutation did not affect the expression of RBB1 at the transcriptional level. RBB1 is a cytosolic protein In order to characterize the function of RBB1 , a fluorescent protein (FP) fusion was generated to visualize its protein localization. Given the large size of the RBB1 coding sequence, we used Recombineering  32 to generate a FP fusion with RBB1 driven by its own promoter and other regulatory sequences. This system utilizes homologous recombination with TAC clones to fusethe gene encoding 3xYpet (YFP for energy transfer), a bright variation of YFP  48, to the gene of interest within the native genomic context. Both N- and C-terminal fusions of RBB1 with 3xYpet were generated and introduced into Col-0 wild type. We could not detect fluorescence in RBB1-3xYpet lines after selection of 15 independent transformants. However, 3xYpet-RBB1was detected in cotyledon epidermal cells, root cortical cells and, although very faint, in the cor- tex of hypocotyls of light-grown seedlings ( S5A and S5B Fig ). No Ypet signal was detected at the root tip corresponding to the cell division zone. In order to determine if the 3xYpet-RBB1fusion is functional, we introgressed the transgene into the rbb1-2 allele by crossing. This ex- periment was carried out in rbb1-2 because the GFP-TIP2;1 marker in rbb1-1 is tightly linked to the RBB1 locus and the probability of identifying rbb1-1 segregants without GFP-TIP2;1 was very low. In contrast to rbb1-2 seedlings stained with Lysotracker red, which showed many bulbs in cotyledons ( Fig 6A ),rbb1-2 seedlings expressing the 3xYpet-RBB1 protein have vacu- ole morphology very similar to the wild type ( Fig 6B and 6C ). Therefore, the 3xYpet-RBB1 construct complements the bulb phenotype of rbb1-2 indicating that this fusion protein is functional. The localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 was diffuse and suggestive of cytosolic localization in coty- ledons of 7-day-old seedlings ( Fig 6D ). In order to determine its sub-cellular distribution in de- tail, we tested for co-localization between 3xYpet-RBB1 and the plasma membrane dye FM4- 64, a marker for the tonoplast, RFP-SYP22  30, and the vacuole dye Lysotracker Red. The 3xYpet-RBB1 marker does not co-localize with FM4-64 ( Fig 6D 6F) or with RFP-SYP22 ( Fig RBB1 Regulates of Vacuole Morphology PLOS ONE  DOI:10.1371journal.pone.0125621 April 27, 2015 12  20Fig 6. 3xYpet-RBB1 is a cytoplasmic protein that associates with the tonoplast.

The marker was found in the cytosol and did not co-localize with Lysotracker Red ( Fig 6J6L), even though occasionally there was good co-localization between these two signals (S5CS5E Fig ). These results indicate 3xYpet-RBB1 protein is most likely a soluble protein that accumulates in the cytosol. We also detected 3xYpet-RBB1 in a punctate pattern inside the vac- uole that seemed to correspond to the tip of TVS labeled with Lysotracker Red in confocal im- ages ( Fig 6J 6L). Interestingly, 3xYpet-RBB1 remained associated with the tip during the elongation of those TVS ( S5F Fig ) in a similar manner as actin bundles  49. These TVS struc- tures may represent cross-sections of membrane sheets that transverse the vacuole, as previous- ly proposed  10,49. In order to determine the significance of this localization, we compared it to the localization of a soluble GFP marker in the same manner. As shown in Fig 6M 6O,a simple GFP marker can also label the tip of TVS, and therefore, the punctate localization of RBB1 may simply result from accumulation of cytoplasmic proteins at the tip of emerging TVS. Immunoblot analysis was used to confirm that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein accumu-lates as the expected size of 400 kDa in seedlings. Membrane and soluble fractions were isolat- ed from wild type Col-0 and the 3xYpet-RBB1 line and the fusion protein was detected with an anti-GFP antibody. The cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBPase) and plasma mem-brane H ATPase were used as soluble and membrane protein controls, respectively. 3xYpet- RBB1 was detected in both the soluble (S100) and the membrane (P100) fractions in 4 days-old seedlings ( Fig 6L andS6 Fig ). These results overall indicate that 3xYpet-RBB1 is a large soluble protein that is likely to associate with cellular membranes. Discussion We have identified rbb1-1 , a novel mutant with defects in vacuole morphology. Vacuoles in rbb1-1 contain increased numbers of bulbs in the large central vacuole of cotyledons and hypo- cotyl cells when compared to the parental control. These defined vacuolar sub-structures canbe visualized with fluorescent protein markers for the tonoplast  15,23. It was recently pro- posed that bulbs, specially when they have more than double the intensity of fluorescence when compared to the tonoplast, are artifacts that result from GFP dimerization that stabilizes the adhesion of tonoplast membranes  24. This model, however, does not explain the accumu- lation of bulbs in the 2xFYVE-YFP line in which the fusion protein associates with the mem- brane in a reversible manner by binding to a specific phosphoinositide  15,23,50. The GFP-TIP2;1-labeled bulbs in rbb1-1 showed between 2 and 3.5-fold higher fluorescence inten- sity when compared to the tonoplast, indicating that they are likely to have a similar structure as previously characterized IVPS and bulbs  15,23,24. We can not discard the possibility that the GFP fusion enhances the stability of the bulbs in rbb1-1 , but rbb1 mutant alleles comprise a sensitized genetic background for studying the formation and regulation of these structures, which are quite elusive under normal conditions. The two other mutants that have been identi- fied as having abnormal bulb accumulation, sgr2andvti11 , have fewer bulbs, also have very ab- normal vacuole morphology  23,25,28. Hence, rbb1-1 is a unique tool to characterize the structure and function of the bulbs in the absence of other vacuolar defects. RBB1 encodes a very large protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the function of RBB1 , we generated a 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein under the control of the RBB1 promoter. This construct complemented the rbb1-2 mutant phenotype indicating that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional. In seedlings, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in the root in the elongation and differentiation zones, but not in the cell division zone, and in hypocotyl andantibodies against GFP ( -GFP), cFBPase ( -cFBPase, control for soluble fraction), and Plasma Membrane HATPase ( -HATPase, control for membrane fraction). doi:10.1371journal.pone.0125621.g006 RBB1 Regulates of Vacuole Morphology PLOS ONE  DOI:10.1371journal.pone.0125621 April 27, 2015 14  20cotyledon epidermal cells. Therefore, 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in cells that contain a large lytic vacuole  51, consistent with a role of RBB1 in regulating the morphology of this impor- tant organelle. Confocal scanning laser microscopy with the 3xYpet-RBB1 line indicated thatthis protein accumulates in the cytosol, and that in a few instances also co-localizes with Lyso-tracker red, a fluorescent dye that labels the tonoplast. RBB1 was found both in the soluble and membrane fractions by fractionation experiments, which raises the possibility that RBB1 may associate with membranes. 3xYpet-RBB1 was often present at the tips of elongating TVS in cot-yledons and leaves, but visualization of a GFP control indicated that this localization may be detected some times with other cytosolic proteins. We detected a significant decrease in the number of TVS in rbb1-1 mutants both in light- and dark-grown hypocotyls and in cotyledons of light-grown seedlings. The TVS phenotype of rbb1-1 supports the hypothesis that RBB1 functions in the formation or stability of TVS. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that both the bulb phenotype and the reduced TVSphenotype can be detected at day 3 during germination. TVS are very dynamic structures that require the actomyosin cytoskeleton  4,5,14,49, and are thought redistribute cytoplasmic contents or to enhance the structural stability of the cytoskeleton  14. A potential role of RBB1 in TVS formation is consistent with the expression of 3xYpet-RBB1 in cells that contain a largevacuole. Given the localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 to the cytosol and its accumulation in both the soluble and membrane fractions, it is tempting to speculate that RBB1 interacts with the tono- plast during the formation and elongation of TVS and contributes to the remodeling of the vac-uolar membrane. However, more experiments beyond the scope of this work are needed to test this possibility. Moreover, we speculate that the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 results from its inability to form functional TVS. Therefore, we propose an alternative model for bulbbiogenesis in which a bulb forms when a TVS initiates but fails to elongate and the bulb func- tions as a mean to accommodate tonoplast membranes and cytoskeletal proteins that may have accumulated at the initiation site, until the bulb membrane is reabsorbed back into the tono-plast. It follows that the bulbs may have no specific function in the vacuole other than the tran-sient accumulation of membranes and proteins when TVS failed to elongate. Further characterization of the function of RBB1 and interacting partners may shed light in the mecha- nisms that remodel the vacuole membrane into TVS or bulbs. Unlike the effects of GFP dimer-ization in vacuole morphology after fusion with vacuolar H-pyrophosphatase  24, it is unlikely that GFP dimerization plays a big role in the TVS phenotype of rbb1. While the bulb fluorescence intensity for cotyledons was 3.5 fold higher than that of tonoplast, this ratio isonly 2.0 for hypocotyls in rbb1-1 , the same tissue that was used to quantify TVS in Fig 2 . There- fore, a ratio higher than 2.0 is not necessary in rbb1-1 to induce the accumulation of bulbs or a reduction in TVS. Previously proposed functions of vacuolar bulbs include acting as a tonoplast reservoir for rapid growth or serving as the sites of degradation of tonoplast membrane and proteins (Saito et al. 2002 and Matrejean et al. 2011). We tested one of these hypotheses by measuring the hy-pocotyl growth of rbb1-1 in the dark, a condition that promotes cell elongation. However, no obvious growth differences were observed between rbb1-1 and the parental line. One possibility is that the additional tonoplast membranes contained in rbb1-1 bulbs do not contribute to cell elongation. Alternatively, other factors such as the elasticity of the cell wall  49 may be limiting and would prevent us from detecting a difference in this assay. TheRBB1 gene is expressed in seedlings and adult plants both in shoots and roots. That RBB1 is expressed as a full-length transcript of 8,957 bp is supported by several ESTs as well as the alignment of RNAseq reads spanning the entire coding sequence by the Integrated Genome Browser  52,53. The molecular function of RBB1 is unknown as the protein has no conserved domains, and it represents a new plant-specific protein.

        "introduction": "The lytic vacuole in vegetative cells may occupy more 90 of the cell volume. This essential or- ganelle is highly dynamic and has critical functions in cellular homeostasis, maintenance of turgor, storage and recycling  13. Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant mem- brane fluctuations and transient and highly mobile structures such as trans-vacuolar strands(TVS), sheets and bulbs  4,5. TVS are dynamic tubules delimited by the tonoplast that are thought to distribute cytoplasmic contents, including organelles between opposite sides of the cortical cytoskeleton  6. In root hairs of Hydrocharis dubia , TVS form predomindantly along the tip growing axis and are thought to deliver cytosolic components to the growing tip  7,8. Many TVS sorrounding the phragmoplast were also observed in tobacco BY-2 cells during cell division  9. The actin cytoskeleton has been localized to TVS  10, and disruption of actin fila- ments results in their dissasembly  11.

The current model for TVS formation is that the actomyosin system regulates TVS forma- tion and dynamics  13,14. Bulbs are spherical structures of diameters between 1 and 10 m that are highly dynamic in the lumen of the vacuole. These membrane structures are associated with the outer tonoplast membrane or transvacuolar strands and contain cytoplasmic structures, even organelles, be- tween the folded membranes  5,15. Imaging by electron microscopy has indicated that bulbs are formed by multiple layers of tonoplast membranes, which explains the increased intensity of bulbs in fluorescently labeled tonoplasts  15. Bulbs are present in LVs of cotyledon and leaf epidermis and their numbers decrease during cotyledon expansion  15, and leaf maturation 16. Bulbs have been visualized by fluorescencence microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) fu- sions with several tonoplast proteins and in multiple cell types. For example, in vacuoles of to- bacco leaves, bulbs were observed when GFP-VAM3SYP22  17 or a GFP fusion with the phosphate transporter NPT2  18 were transiently expressed. In Arabidopsis, bulbs have been detected in epidermis of the root elongation zone and the leaf, sepal bundle sheet, and germi- nating pollen of stably transformed plants expressing either GFP-AtVAM3  5, TPK1-GFP 19,20, TIP1;1-GFP  21, or FP fusions with other tonoplast intrinsic proteins  16,22. In ad- dition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate sensor 2xFYVE-YFP also labels the bulbs  23. These structures are not simply the result of ectopic expression of FP fusions because they were also detected in Arabidopsis WT plants by electron microscopy  15. It was recently proposed that bulbs may form by dimerization of GFP or YFP tags when fused to tonoplast markers, and that some of these structures may be artifacts from this interaction  24. Two types of struc- tures were distinguished: bulbs associated with high levels of expression of GFP fusions thatshowed 3 or more fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the tonoplast, and intra-vacuolar spherical structures (IVSPs) present in transgenic lines in which the intensity of fluorescence was only two fold that of the tonoplast and were visualized with a non-dimeriz-ing GFP molecule. This distinction was most dramatic in the root elongation zone where onlyvery bright bulbs were observed, but it was more complex in other tissues, such as the cotyle- don epidermis, where both types of structures existed  24. Two hypotheses for the function of bulbs have been proposed. Bulbs may act as reservoirs of membranes for cell expansion or they may represent the first step for proteolysis of tonoplast proteins inside the vacuole  15,19. Only two mutants with bulb phenotypes have been identi- fied thus far. These are sgr2-1 andvti11 , and in both cases these mutants show a reduced num- ber of bulbs  23. SGR2 encodes a protein similar to phospholipase A1, and sgr2mutants have an abnormal vacuole morphology with multiple small vacuole-like structures and abnormal distribution of the vacuole and the cytosol in shoot endodermal cells  25. VTI11 encodes a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein that mediates membrane fusion between pre-vacuolar compartments and the vacuole  26, 27. VTI11 is also involved in vacuole homotypic fusion, and vti11 mutant alleles have highly frag- mented vacuoles  28. Given the highly abnormal vacuole morphology of these two mutants, it is unclear if the lack of bulbs is a direct or indirect effect of the loss of SGR2 and VTI11. Here we describe the phenotype of regulator of bulb biogenesis1 (rbb1-1 ), a novel mutant in Arabidopsis that displays increased numbers of bulbs in otherwise normal vacuoles. We showthatrbb1-1 mutants make fewer TVS than the parental control. We propose the hypothesis that RBB1 may function in TVS formation and that increased bulb accumulation in rbb1-1 may result from impaired formation of TVS. In addition, we show that the differential labelingof bulbs between rbb1-1 and the parental line does not result from abnormal trafficking to the vacuole. We also identified RBB1 locus, which encodes a large plant-specific protein of unknown function.
