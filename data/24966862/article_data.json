Keywords: Arabidopsis, Ca2, salicylic acid, phosphoinositides, InsP 3, plant defense signaling, SAR INTRODUCTION Plants have developed a multilayered strategy to effectively con- trol and combat pathogen invasion ( Jones and Dangl, 2006 ). The rst line of defense is triggered by the recognition of microbial- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMP or PAMP) by the membrane associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Nrnberger et al., 2004; Delledonne, 2005 ). Pathogen triggered immunity (PTI) also known as basal resistance ( Jones and Dangl, 2006 ), is non-specic and against a range of virulent pathogens. A series of rapid responses are initiated within seconds to min- utes of encountering MAMPs including ionic uxes, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of kinase cascades followed shortly by transcriptional reprogramming (reviewed inPostel and Kemmerling, 2009; Gimenez-Ibanez and Rathjen, 2010; Tsuda and Katagiri, 2010 ). The second line of defense known as effector-triggered immu- nity (ETI) involves recognition of specic pathogen avirulent proteins by their counterpart plant disease resistance (R) pro- teins located within the cell (reviewed in Jones and Dangl, 2006 ).The local infected sites undergo programmed cell death to halt pathogen growth as part of the hypersensitive response (HR). HR also involves rapid ion uxes and production of ROS (reviewed inT orres et al., 2006 ) as well as induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. In addition to the local response, distal parts of the plant develop immunity against a broad range of pathogens, known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). A hallmark of SAR is an increase in salicylic acid (SA). SA accumulates in both distal and infected leaves in response to pathogen attack and treatment with SA or SA analogs can induce the PRgenes such as PR-1 ,PR- 2,a n d PR-5 (reviewed in Durrant and Dong, 2004; Fu and Dong, 2013 ). More recently several other metabolites have been impli- cated as mobile signals in the development of SAR ( Park et al., 2007 ;r e v i e w e di n Kachroo and Kachroo, 2009; Gao et al., 2014 ). A transient increase in cytosolic Ca2(Ca2in)i so n eo f the early events associated with both PTI and ETI. The initial increase in Ca2upon MAMP recognition is accepted to be via an inux through plasma membrane localized Ca2chan- nels, such as cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGC) andor www.frontiersin.org June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 1 Hung et al. InsP 3in plant defense responses glutamate receptor (GluRs) channels. In addition, the involve- ment of intracellular Ca2stores in the propagation of the Ca2signal is very likely (reviewed in Ma and Berkowitz, 2007; McAinsh and Pittman, 2009; Manzoor et al., 2012 ). Several downstream defense related events are regulated by Ca2includ- ing activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) andcalcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) cascades and modu-lation of Ca 2binding proteins (reviewed in Ma and Berkowitz, 2011; Wurzinger et al., 2011; Boudsocq and Sheen, 2013; Romeisand Herde, 2014 ). The MAMP-triggered oxidative burst also appears to dependent on the initial cytosolic Ca 2elevation. The NADP oxidase RbohD is directly and indirectly regulated byCa 2(Sagi and Fluhr, 2006; Dubiella et al., 2013 ). In response to elicitation with g22, early membrane depolarization eventsare unaffected in the rbohD mutant ( Jeworutzki et al., 2010 )a n d the cytosolic Ca 2elevation is similar to wild type plants ( Ranf et al., 2011 ). A rise in cytosolic Ca2is also important for ETI responses and may precede the oxidative burst in response to avir-ulent pathogens ( Grant et al., 2000 ). Furthermore, several Ca 2 or calmodulin (CaM) binding transcription factors TGA, CPB60g a n dC A M T A 3 ,( r e v i e w e di n Reddy et al., 2011 ) act as both posi- tive and negative regulators of SA accumulation and SA-regulatedPRgene expression. Many lipids and lipid related molecules are thought to play roles in plant defense signaling and responses to both biotrophicand necrotrophic pathogens (reviewed in Shah, 2005; Walley et al., 2013 ). However, there is less information on the poten- tial involvement of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway inplant defense. The membrane-associated phospholipids alongwith the soluble inositol phosphates (collectively known as phos-phoinositides) are present in all eukaryotic cells and are impli-cated in plant responses to many environmental stimuli (seereviews in Stevenson et al., 2000; Meijer and Munnik, 2003; Krinke et al., 2007a; Im et al., 2010, 2011 ). In the canonical path- way, phosphatidylinositol is sequentially phosphorylated to phos-phatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinosi-tol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP 2) by the enzymes phosphatidyli- nositol 4-kinase (PI4K) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate5-kinase (PIP5K), respectively. Activation of phospholipase C(PLC) in response to a stimulus or stress leads to the hydrolysisof PtdInsP 2to generate the soluble second messenger inosi- tol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP 3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). While many aspects of the phosphoinositide pathway are conservedin plants there are several differences between plants and ani-mals (reviewed in Munnik and Nielsen, 2011; Delage et al., 2013; Pokotylo et al., 2014 ). In plants, DAG is converted to phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), while InsP 3maybe further phospho- rylated to form inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6). Both InsP 3 and InsP 6are thought to release Ca2from intracellular stores (reviewed in Krinke et al., 2007a; Im et al., 2010; Gillaspy, 2011 ). Additionally, InsP 5and InsP 6are implicated in hormone signaling via their interaction with the jasmonic acid recep-tor COI ( Sheard et al., 2010; Mosblech et al., 2011 )a n dt h e auxin receptor TIR1 ( Tan et al., 2007 ), respectively. PtdOH may also be generated by hydrolysis of structural phospholipidssuch as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine(PE) via the phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes. Recent reportsimplicate PtdOH as an important signaling molecule in plants in both abiotic and biotic stresses (reviewed in Te s ter i n k a n d Munnik, 2011 ). Using a transgenic inducible system to express type III effectors (AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2) in planta, a bipha-sic accumulation of PtdOH was reported involving rst PLCand then PLD activation ( Andersson et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, activation of both PI4K and PLD has been shown to bean early response of suspension cells to treatment with SA(Krinke et al., 2007b, 2009 ). PtdOH-binding targets include the NAD oxidase RbohD and MPK6 protein kinase and PtdOH isimplicated in ROS and HR responses (reviewed in Canonne et al., 2011; T esterink and Munnik, 2011 ). Specic PLC iso- forms may also regulate defense responses ( Vossen et al., 2010; Canonne et al., 2011 ). Arabidopsis mutants which have con- stitutively low InsP 6levels exhibited an increased susceptibil- ity to microbial infections ( Murphy et al., 2008 ). Collectively these results support the involvement of the phosphoinositidesin plant defense; however there are many missing links in ourunderstanding. In this study, our goal was to further investigate the func- tion of phosphoinositide-mediated signaling in the plant defensenetwork. In previous work, we generated transgenic Arabidopsisplants expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), which specically hydrolyzes solubleinositol phosphates and terminates InsP 3-mediated signals. These InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants have normal growth and morphol-ogy under optimal growth conditions. However, their basal InsP 3 levels are greatly reduced, to only 5 of wild type level ( Perera et al., 2006 ). The InsP 5-ptase plants exhibit delayed and reduced responses to gravity and impaired Ca2signaling in response to salt and cold stimuli ( Perera et al., 2006, 2008 ). The InsP 5-ptase plants were also shown to be less resistant to wounding and her-bivory ( Mosblech et al., 2008 ). Interestingly, a global comparison of basal transcript proles between wild type and InsP 5-ptaseplants revealed that 16 out of 62 basally downregulated genes intransgenic plants were defense related ( Perera et al., 2008 ), includ- ing PR-1 ,PR-2 ,PR-5 ,a n d AIG1 (avrRpt2- induced gene1 ). In the current study, we demonstrate that InsP 5-ptase plants showimpaired Ca 2elevation in response to g22, decreased expres- sion of several defense related genes and delayed and reducedSAR. Our results support the role of InsP 3as a mediator of the intracellular Ca2cascade and highlight the involvement of phosphoinositide-mediated signaling in the development of arobust defense response in plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR PLANTS AND BACTERIA Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the human type I inos-itol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase generated via Agrobacteriummediated transformation were generated previously ( Perera et al., 2006 ). Plants were grown in a growth chamber under 8 h light16 h dark, light intensity of 150mol m 2s1, 3550 humidity and temperature of 21C. All experiments were car- ried out using 68 week old healthy well watered plants withfully expanded leaves (prior to bolting). For most experiments,wild type (Wt) and two independent transgenic lines (T6 andT8), were tested along with the empty vector control (C2). Frontiers in Plant Science  Plant-Microbe Interaction June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 2Hung et al. InsP 3in plant defense responses Bacterial strains PstDC3000 and isogenic lines carrying avr- Rpt2 oravrRpm1 genes were cultured at room temperature in Kings medium B (40 g L1peptone, 2 (vv) glycerol, 1.5 g L1K2HPO 4and 1.5 g L1MgSO 4, pH 7) containing 50 g ml1kanamycin, and 100 gm l1rifampacin. The two non- pathogenic strains, PstDC3000 with mutated effector protein hrcCand P . syringae pv. Phaseolicola 6, were also cultured at room temperature on Kings medium B plates containing 100 ugml rifampacin, and an additional 34 gm l1chloramphenicol for growing PstDC3000 hrcC. PATHOGEN INOCULATION For preparing bacteria used in pathogen inoculation experiments, cells from an overnight culture were rst resuspended in 10 mM MgCl 2, and the concentration of bacteria was adjusted based on the absorbance reading at OD 600. The actual titer was also deter- mined by counting serial dilutions on a selection plate after 48 h atroom temperature. T o examine the growth of bacteria in planta,leaves were inoculated either by hand using a 1 ml needle-lesssyringe or by spraying with bacteria solution containing an addi-tional 0.02 (vv) silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX).The bacterial titer was determined from 4 leaf discs (total areais 1 cm 2) collected from 4 separate leaves, (one leaf per plant). Pooled leaf discs were ground in 10 mM MgCl 2in a nal volume of 1 ml. The colony-forming units (cfu) were obtained by spot-ting 2l of a serial 10-fold titrated bacteria onto Kings medium B plates containing appropriate antibiotics and additional 50 g ml 1cyclohexamine for preventing fungus contamination. In each experiment, a total of 4 plants per line were used. Forstatistical analysis either Students t-test or analysis of variance (ANOV A) were performed. FLAGELLIN TREATMENT The elicitor g22 was synthesized by EZBiolab custom peptideservice (Westeld, IN) based on the peptide sequence reportedinFelix et al. (1999) . For root growth inhibition experiments, 0.1M of g22 was used which caused the half-maximal growth inhibition in Arabidopsis seedlings reported in Gomez-Gomez et al. (1999) . For induction of ROS production in leaf discs, the procedure was adapted from Gomez-Gomez et al. (1999) with a g22 concentration of 1 M. For induction of Ca 2release and qRT-PCR analysis of g22 responsive gene expression, 10 M g22 was used according to Navarro et al. (2004) and Zipfel et al. (2004) . SAR ASSAY T o induce SAR, two fully expanded leaves of wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants were hand inoculated with avirulent strain Pst DC3000 avrRpt2 (OD 6000.001; 7 .5105cfuml). The un- induced plants were mock inoculated with 10 mM MgCl 2,( t w o leaves per plant). Both induced and un-induced plants were thenseparated into 4 groups for challenging with the virulent strainPstDC3000 (OD 6000.004; 2 106cfuml) at day 0, 1, 2, or 3 post inoculation by spraying the bacteria onto the whole plants.T o examine the development of SAR, systemic leaves sprayed withPstDC3000 were collected. Leaf extracts were prepared and the cfu was counted as described previously. The growth of virulentbacteria in induced and un-induced plants was compared for determining the level of SAR. INOSITOL (1,4,5) TRISPHOSPHATE ASSAY For measuring the InsP 3level of inoculated leaves, 45 plants per experiment for each bacterial strain were grouped together andsprayed with bacterial solution prepared as before. The treatedleaves were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.Frozen tissues (around 0.08 g) were ground into powder in liquidnitrogen and then incubated with 160 l of 20 perchloric acid on ice for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged to remove the debrisand the supernatant was transferred to a new tube followed by pHadjustment to 7.5 using 1.5 M KOH3 mM HEPES. InsP 3assays were carried out using the TRK 1000 InsP 3assay kit (Amersham- Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously ( Perera et al., 2006 ). SA MEASUREMENT AND APPLICATION For analysis of total SA at the local inoculated leaves, plants were syringe-inoculated with PstDC3000 avrRpt2 ,a n di n o c u - lated leaves were harvested at day 2 post inoculation. T o extracttotal SA (free SA SA conjugates), the protocol described inNandi et al. (2004) was used. In brief, leaves were rst ground into powder in liquid nitrogen, and then 0.2 g of ground tissue was extracted rst with 90 methanol and againwith 100 methanol. The combined extracts were subjected toevaporation under N 2gas. After evaporation, the residue was rst resuspended in 5 trichloroacetic acid and then submit-ted to acid hydrolysis by HCl at 100 C for 30 min. SA was extracted with cyclohexane:ethylacetate:isopropanol (50:50:1).The organic phase was evaporated and resuspended in HPLC elu-ent. Chromatography was performed on a 3 .9300-mm C18 reverse-phase Bondapak column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). For exogenous SA application, SA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was rst dissolved in ethanol, then diluted to 300 M in water with additional 0.02 (vv) silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds,Round Rock, TX), and the pH was adjusted to 7 with 0.1 M KOH.For control solution, equal amount of ethanol without SA wasd i l u t e di nt h es a m ew a y .S o l u t i o n sw e r eg e n t l ya n de v e n l ys p r a y e don plants. Treated plants were then kept in a growth chamber withplastic covers until harvest. CALCIUM-DEPENDENT AEQUORIN BIOLUMINESCENCE The wild type and two independent InsP 5-ptase plants (T6 andT8) expressing cytosolic aequorin ( Knight et al., 1996 )w e r ec r e - ated previously ( Perera et al., 2008 ). For measuring Ca 2changes after treatment with g22, 5-day old seedlings were rst incubatedwith 2 M coelenterazine (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) solu- tion in the dark for 16 h. Seedlings were transferred into tubescontaining water and placed in the luminometer and a base-line reading was obtained. After 1 min, seedlings were treatedwith 10 M g22 which was injected automatically to avoid any handling. The luminescence signals were recorded at 10 s inter-vals for 35 min. The Ca 2concentration were calculated after measuring the discharged Ca2as described previously ( Knight et al., 1996; Perera et al., 2008 ). For monitoring the Ca2increase after pathogen treatment, fully expanded leaves were rst inl-trated with 2 M coelenterazine (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) www.frontiersin.org June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 3Hung et al. InsP 3in plant defense responses solution and kept in the dark for 16 h, then the reconstituted leaves were inoculated with PstDC3000 avrRpm1 (OD 6000.5; 5108cfuml) or 10 mM MgCl 2mock solution. Immediately, detached leaves were placed into a tube containing 100 lw a t e rt o prevent drying out. The luminescence signals were recorded every5 s for 3 h. The timing of the peak luminescence were taken for cal-culation. Luminescence measurements were made using a Siriusluminometer (Berthold Detection Systems GmbH, Pforzheim,Germany). CHEMILUMINSCENT AND IN SITU DETECTION OF ROS For chemiluminescent detection of ROS, uniform leaf discs were rst incubated overnight in sterile water in the dark. Two leaf discs were placed in a test tube containing 105 L sterile water, with 1 g horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 20 M luminol, and 1 M g22. Luminescence resulting from the reaction between hydrogen peroxide, HRP , and luminol was mea-sured for 35 min in Sirius luminometer (Berthold DetectionSystems GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). For in situ detection of ROS, plants were either sprayed or hand-inoculated withPstDC3000 avrRpt2 . Infected leaves were carefully removed at 6 or 48 h, and vacuum-inltrated with fresh 0.1 (wv) of 3,3 prime- diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Lious, MO) dis-solved in 0.01 N HCl. Inltrated leaves were kept in the dark for3 h, then de-stained in a destaining solution of 95 EtOH:85acetic acids: glycerol (3:1:1 in volume) and photographed. RNA ISOLATION AND qRT-PCR T otal RNA was isolated by RNeasy plant mini kits (Qiagen,Germantown, MD). For RT-PCR, the rst strand cDNA wassynthesized from total RNA using Ominiscript reverse transcrip-tase (Qiagen) and random primers, and PCR of specic geneswas carried out using Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen).For qRT-PCR, the rst strand cDNA was synthesized usingStrataScript QPCR cDNA synthesis kits (Agilent T echnologiesInc., Santa Clara, CA) and random primers, and the PCR reac-tion was performed using Full Velocity SYBR-Green QPCRMaster mix (Agilent T echnologies Inc.) on the Mx3000p ther-mocycler (Agilent T echnologies Inc.). Genes that were analyzedfrom the Primary Library for Arabidopsis Pathogen-InducibleGenes (cat PR0100, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Lious, MO) are listedin Supplementary Table 1. Primer sequences of other examinedgenes are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The fold change in rel-ative gene expression was calculated based on the 2 Delta1Delta1Ctmethod (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008 ) using wild type as the normalizer and ACT2 orPP2A as the reference genes. PETIOLE EXUDATE EXPERIMENT For collecting the petiole exudates, we followed the method described in Maldonado et al. (2002) and Chaturvedi et al. (2008) .L e a v e sw e r eh a n di n o c u l a t e dw i t h PstDC3000 avrRpt2 (OD 6000.01; 5.5106cfuml) or mock inoculation with 10 mM MgCl 2. Treated plants were placed in the growth chamber and covered with plastic lids. After 67 h, inoculated leaves werecut from their bases and immediately dipped in 50 ethanol.They were rinsed once briey with 0.0005 Clorox bleach andthen placed in 1 mM EDTA solution. A group of 10 leaves wasplaced in a collection tube containing 2.5 ml of 1mM EDTA and 50 gm l 1ampicillin, pH 8. They were kept in a covered tray with wet paper towels at the base of the tray to maintainthe humidity in the growth chamber under continuous light.After 16 h, collected exudates were diluted 2 fold with water, andlter-sterilized before use. RESULTS THE RESPONSE OF InsP 5-ptase PLANTS TO g22 The bacterial elicitor agellin is a well characterized MAMP usedto investigate plant innate immunity responses. We rst treatedwild type and InsP 5-ptase seedlings with the active elicitor pep-tide g22 and measured root growth. A greater inhibition ofroot growth was observed in the InsP 5-ptase seedlings com-pared to wild type ( Figure 1A ), indicating that the transgenic plants are more sensitive to g22. We next monitored Ca 2induc- tion, ROS production and g22-associated pathogen-responsivegene expression; which are all known to be triggered by g22treatment in Arabidopsis ( Gomez-Gomez et al., 1999; Asai et al., 2002; Navarro et al., 2004; Zipfel et al., 2004; Boudsocq et al.,2010; Ma et al., 2012 ). Treatment with g22 elicits a rapid rise in cytosolic Ca 2which can be monitored using aequorin-mediated bioluminescence ( Jeworutzki et al., 2010; Ranf et al., 2011 ). InsP 5-ptase seedlings expressing aequorin ( Perera et al., 2008 )w e r e treated with g22 and the intracellular Ca2changes were moni- tored. Upon treatment with g22, a rapid rise in Ca2cytwith a peak at 2m i nw a so b s e r v e di nb o t hw i l dt y p ea n dI n s P5 - p t a s e plants; however, the induction level was greatly reduced in InsP5-ptase plants ( Figure 1B ) with an average reduction in the Ca 2 signal of 44 in the transgenic plants ( Figure 1C ). As shown by the root growth experiment ( Figure 1A ), the InsP 5-ptase plants are responsive to g22; the increased root growth inhibi-tion correlates with the attenuation of the Ca 2signal. We also monitored the oxidative burst (by measuring H 2O2generation) after elicitation with g22. An increase in ROS was detected at therst 12 min post treatment, which peaked 5 min, and tapered off returning to the baseline within 25 min ( Figure 1D ), which was different from the sustained Ca 2elevation ( Figure 1B ). Surprisingly, there was no signicant difference in ROS gener-ation between wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants. These resultsdemonstrate that although the Ca 2release after g22 treatment was dampened, the oxidative burst was not affected. Our data suggested that the InsP 5-ptase plants could be a tool to potentially distinguish between parallel downstream pathwaysof MAMP-triggered immunity. In order to further investigate thedownstream responses, a group of genes known to be inducedby g22-FLS2 interaction ( Asai et al., 2002; Qutob et al., 2006; Gust et al., 2007; Boudsocq et al., 2010 ) were selected and their expression levels were quantied by qRT-PCR. The ve selectedgenes were GST1 ,RLK ,FRK1 ,NHL10 ,a n d MLO6 .T h ep e a k expression of MLO6 was at 30 min after g22 treatment, whereas the other four genes showed a peak expression at 120 min postg22 treatment ( Figure 1E ). Both wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants, showed similar kinetics of induction; however, expressionlevels at 120 min were signicantly reduced in the InsP 5-ptaseplants compared to the wild type. The reduction in expres-sion suggests that the InsP 5-ptase plants are unable to sustain Frontiers in Plant Science  Plant-Microbe Interaction June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 4Hung et al.

Interestingly, FRK1 and NHL10 are both considered to be regulated via MAPK depen- dent pathways ( Boudsocq et al., 2010 ) and these results suggest a role for phosphoinositide signaling interacting with the MAPKcascade. THE RESPONSE OF INSP 5-PTASE PLANTS TO VIRULENT AND AVIRULENT STRAINS OF P. SYRINGAE We next examined the interaction between the InsP 5-ptase trans- genic plants and the plant pathogenic bacteria, P . syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 which is widely used to study plant dis- ease resistance ( Nishimura and Dangl, 2010 ). In Arabidopsis, PstDC3000 bacteria multiply rapidly and disease symptoms can be observed 2 day post-infection with characteristic tissue necrosis and chlorosis ( Katagiri et al., 2002 ). Both virulent and avirulent strains of P . syringae were used to evaluate thesusceptibility of InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants compared to wild type. Figure 2A shows that transgenic plants exhibited more severe symptoms after infection with the virulent strain of P . syringae (PstDC3000). Moreover, when those infected leaves were har- vested and bacterial concentration was quantied, the InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants harbored more bacteria at OD 6000.001 and 0.0005 compared to the wild type, indicating they are moresusceptible to PstDC3000 ( Figure 2B ). Similarly, the transgenic plants also showed a slight elevated bacterial growth of the avir-ulent strain PstDC3000 avrRpt2 at the low concentration of inoculants OD 6000.0005 ( Figure 2C ). Compared to the wild type the InsP 5-ptase plants are more susceptible to the aviru-lent strain; however the response to the avirulent strain was notas intense as the response to the virulent strain, suggesting thatthe gene-for-gene defense mechanism is still functional. www.frontiersin.org June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 5Hung et al. InsP 3in plant defense responses FIGURE 2  The response of InsP 5-ptase plants to Pseudomonas syringae .Leaves of Arabidopsis plants inoculated with PstDC3000 at OD 6000.001 (7 105cfuml) were photographed at day 2 after inoculation (A). Bacterial growth measured from plants at day 2 after inoculation with Pst DC3000 (B)orPstDC3000 avrRpt2 (C). Starting bacterial cultures are OD 6000.01 (8106cfuml), 0.001 (7 105cfuml) or 0.0005 (3.5105cfuml). (D)Infected leaves used for RT -PCR were inoculated withPstDC3000 avrRpt2 (OD 6000.001, 7 105cfuml). RT -PCR was carried out with gene-specic primers for PR-1 andActin .(E)For bacterial growth counts taken at day 4 after inoculation with the two non-pathogens, PstDC3000 hrcC- (Pst hrcC- )a n d P . syringae pv.Phaseolicola race 6 ( Psp rc6), the concentration of inoculants were OD 6000.001 (7 105cfuml). Plant lines used were Wt (white), T8 (black), and the rps2rpm1 double knock-out mutant (gray).P0.05. We also compared the disease response of InsP 5-ptase plants to that of rps2rpm1 double mutants (lacking both of the Rps2 and Rpm1 R genes) which are equally susceptible to both virulent and avirulent strains of PstDC3000 even at low concentrations of inoculant. We found that transgenic plants were less affected thanthe rps2rpm1 mutants when challenged with avirulent strains PstDC3000 avrRpt2 ;a n dd i dn o th a v et h es a m eh i g hl e v e lo f bacterial growth ( Figure 2C ). Therefore, the response of InsP 5- ptase plants to PstDC3000 avrRpt2 is not similar to rps2rpm1 double mutant which lacks the Rgene mediated resistance. The enhanced susceptibility pattern observed in InsP 5-ptase plantsis more similar to previously reported mutants with a defectin SA-mediated disease resistance, such as nahG and eds16 sid2 mutants ( Gaffney et al., 1993; Delaney et al., 1994; Dewdney et al., 2000; Wildermuth et al., 2001 ). These plants with a defect in SA- mediated resistance are more susceptible to avirulent bacterialstrains, but not so severely as to virulent bacterial strains, indi-cating that the Rgenes in these mutant plants are not affected (Dewdney et al., 2000 ). It is possible that the enhanced suscepti- bility toward avirulent strains might be the result of dampenedsignal transduction leading to disease resistance. T o test thishypothesis, we examined PR-1 gene induction as a downstreamresponse during the course of infection with PstDC3000 avrRpt2 at 3, 8, 24, and 48 h, and found that the two independent InsP 5-ptase lines T6 and T8 show a delayed induction of gene expression(the response was observed at 8 h instead of 3 h) compared to thewild type and vector control plants C2 ( Figure 2D ). T o further demonstrate that basal defense is compromised, we challenged InsP 5-ptase plants with a TTSS-defective hrcC mutant ofPstDC3000 (in which pathogen effector proteins are not deliv- ered into host plants such that only a few bacteria multiply in wildtype plants). We found a slight elevation in bacterial growth inInsP 5-ptase plants ( Figure 2E ), suggesting that the basal defense in InsP 5-ptase plants was weakened. However, we did not observeany bacterial growth or symptoms when challenged with thenon-host pathogen strain P . syringae pv. Phaseolicola strain race 6 in both wild type and transgenic plants, even after 12 days(Figure 2E ). These results suggest that the non-host resistance mechanism in transgenic plants is not affected. Previous microarray data indicated that a group of disease resistance-related genes are basally downregulated under nor-mal growth conditions in two independent InsP 5-ptase plantscompared to wild type and vector control plants. These includePR-1 ,PR-5 ,a n d AIG1 (avrRpt2- induced gene1 ), as well as genes Frontiers in Plant Science  Plant-Microbe Interaction June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 6Hung et al. InsP 3in plant defense responses encoding proteins involved in Ca2storage in the endoplasmic r e t i c u l u m( E R )s u c ha s CRT3 and BiP3 (Perera et al., 2008 ). In this study we used qRT-PCR to analyze a set of selected genes.We determined that, in addition to previously identied defense-related genes, PR-2 , two putative glutathione-S-transferase genes (GST11 and GST16 ) and three protein kinases ( CRK7 ,CRK45 , and RLP23 ) were also basally downregulated in InsP 5-ptase plants ( Ta b l e 1 ). Among the eleven genes tested, eight of them are also required for SAR according to the GO annotation in TAIR.Although BiP3 has not been annotated as the other eight genes, other BiP isoforms have been shown to play a role in promotingplant immunity ( Wang et al., 2005; Carvalho et al., 2014 ). The data suggest that reduced expression of these genes might con-tribute to the enhanced susceptibility of the transgenic plants toP . syringae . InsP 3CHANGES AND CALCIUM RELEASE DURING ETI In order to determine whether InsP 3is induced in wild type plants when infected with P . syringae , we examined InsP 3levels during a 6 h period of post spray with P . syringae in wild type Arabidopsis leaves. When spray-infected with a virulent strain PstDC3000, InsP 3levels increased two-fold at 4 h post spray ( Figure 3A ). When infected with avirulent strains PstDC3000 avrRpm1 or avrRpt2 ,I n s P 3levels increased 23 fold at a shorter time, 20 min and 1 h post spray, respectively. No change in InsP 3levels was observed with mock spray ( Figure 3A ). These results demon- strate that the induction of InsP 3is one of the signals generated during plant-pathogen interaction. The difference in the induc-tion times of InsP 3between virulent and avirulent pathogens is in good agreement with the rapid induction of HR by avirulentstrains compared to the slower development of disease symptomsby virulent strains ( Katagiri et al., 2002 ). In a previous study, a biphasic increase in cytosolic Ca 2was measured by aequorin-mediated bioluminescence in Arabidopsisleaves infected with avirulent strains of PstDC3000 avrB or T able 1  Genes that were basally repressed in InsP 5-ptase plants.

Similar results were obtained with an independent line T6.avrRpm1 (Grant et al., 2000 ). We tested aequorin lines of wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants infected with PstDC3000 avrRpm1. We found that the early transient rise in Ca2inwas similar in both wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants but there were differ-ences in the second sustained increase in Ca 2in.T h ew i l dt y p e showed a peak of Ca2at 110 min post inoculation which is sim- ilar to the previous report ( Grant et al., 2000 ). In InsP 5-ptase plants, there was a 20 min delay in the timing of the Ca2release (Figure 3B ) suggesting that InsP 3-mediated signaling contributes to the cytosolic Ca2increase observed in avirulent pathogen infected leaves. ROS PRODUCTION AND SA-MEDIATED SIGNALING DURING ETI The oxidative burst in avirulent pathogen infected leaves is partof the disease resistance mechanism (see review in Lamb and Dixon, 1997 ) .I tl e a d st ot h eg e n e r a t i o no fR O S ,w h i c hp r e - sumably could conne bacterial growth (see review in Tor re s et al., 2006 ). T o examine the ROS production in avirulent pathogen infected leaves, we used 3,3 prime-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to detect ROS production in situ . Similar to the result observed with agellin treatment ( Figure 1A ), no difference in ROS production between wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants wasobserved (Supplementary Figure 1). In both lines staining wasvisible at 6 h and disappeared at 48 h either after inocula-tion or spraying with PstDC3000 avrRpt2 . The results demon- strate that the HR-induced oxidative burst and ROS produc-tion are unaffected in InsP 5-ptase plants and suggest thatROS generation in plant ETI does not involve InsP 3-mediated pathways. Because SA is a key systemic signal generated during ETI, we compared the SA levels in wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants ( Figure 4A ). We measured total SA including the conjugated form. The basal SA level in transgenic plantswas50 of the amount in wild type. After inoculating with PstDC3000 avrRpt2 , the SA levels increased in local inoculated wild type leaves and to a lesser extent in the InsP 5-ptase leaves.Although the SA reduction post inoculation in the transgenicplants is not highly signicant ( P0.1), the results do show that the total basal SA in InsP 5-ptase plants was signicantlylower compared to wild type. It was not impaired as much as innahG plants and sid2 mutants, but this low efciency might be enough to reduce the SA-mediated signaling and cause delay indownstream gene expression, such as PR-1 . T o further investigate whether the delayed PR-1 gene induction observed in InsP 5-ptase plants ( Figure 2D ) was due to a delayed response to SA, we applied exogenous SA and monitored PR-1 gene induction over a two day period. The wild type and vec-tor control plants (C2) as well as two independent InsP 5-ptaselines were treated with 300 M SA by mist spray, treated leaves were harvested at 0, 8, 24, and 48 h and PR-1 transcript levels was monitored by RT-PCR ( Figure 4B ). Both InsP 5-ptase lines have similar induction of PR-1 as wild type and C2 in response to exogenous SA, suggesting that the InsP 5-ptase plants can respondto SA similar to the wild type. The data suggest that the delayinPR-1 gene induction is probably due to the delayed synthe- sis of SA. This result excludes the possibility of InsP 3being an intermediate between SA and PR-1 gene expression. www.frontiersin.org June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 7Hung et al.

(A) Wild type Arabidopsis plants were sprayed with PstDC3000 or PstDC3000 avrRpt2 or avrRpm1 at a concentration of OD 6000.004 (2 106cfuml). Mock spray was 10 mM MgCl 2. Treated leaves were harvested at different time points and InsP 3was quantied.

A representative experiment is shown with luminescence counts taken in every 5 s. The table lists the average time of the second sustained Ca2peak (N independent biological replicates). THE SAR RESPONSE IN InsP 5-ptase PLANTS In order to examine whether the reduced SA basal levels and delayed PR-1 induction would compromise SAR in InsP 5-ptase plants, we carried out an SAR assay ( Zhang et al., 2010 ). Plants were rst inoculated with PstDC3000 avrRpt2 ,( t w ol e a v e sp e r plant), and then challenged with PstDC3000 by spraying whole plants at day 0, 1, 2, and 3 post rst inoculation. T o monitorthe progression of bacterial growth in systemic leaves, bacterialcounts were measured in leaves at day 4 post spray. We foundthat wild type plants acquired resistance to PstDC3000 around day 3 post rst inoculation showing a reduced bacterial growthcompared to that at day 0, 1, and 2 ( Figure 5A ). Although the bacterial growth in InsP 5-ptase plants also declined slightly atday 3, the reduced growth is not statistically signicant comparedto that at day 0, 1, and 2. The assay result indicates that the SARresponse was affected in InsP 5-ptase plants. It could be that theacquired resistance was not induced as much as in the wild typeat day 3, (i.e., a delayed response), or it could be that the levelof resistance was substantially reduced. No acquired resistancewas detected when plants were rst mock inoculated with 10 mM MgCl 2(Figure 5B ). T o investigate the expression levels of defense-related genes during SAR induction in systemic leaves, we performed qRT-PCR analysis over a time course. We rst inoculated plants withPstDC3000 avrRpt2 (two leaves per plant), then the systemic leaves were harvested at 3 h, 8 h, day 1, and day 2 post-inoculation.We monitored expression of a total of 47 genes (for a completegene list see Supplementary Table 1). We found 14 genes that weredifferentially expressed in the wild type and two transgenic plantlines that were either only induced in the wild type or showedreduced and delayed induction in the transgenic plants ( Ta b l e 2 , calculated data are in Supplementary Table 3). Among these 14genes, eight of them had low basal expression in the transgenicplants. The remaining six genes, which were not basally low,exhibited a reduced and delayed induction. These genes includedNHL10 ,RLK1 ,PAD4 ,a n d NIMIN-2 , which are implicated in SAR and SA-mediated signaling ( Zhou et al., 1998; Li et al., 2004; Navarro et al., 2004; Weigel et al., 2005 ).

InsP 3in plant defense responses FIGURE 4  InsP 5-ptase plants have a low basal level of SA; however the local response to exogenous SA is normal. (A) SA levels were measured in untreated leaves (basal) or in leaves harvested from plants inoculated with PstDC3000 avrRpt2 at a concentration of OD 6000.1 (1108cfuml) at day 2 post-inoculation. Data is the average of three to ve experiments SE. Each experiment consisted of a pool of leaves from four individual plantsline. (B)Wild type (Wt), two independent InsP 5-ptase lines (T6 and T8), and vector control (C2) plants were sprayed with 300 M of SA or control solution (0.05 ethanol). Leaves were harvested before (0) and at 3, 8, 24, and 48 h after treatment. RT -PCR was carried out withgene-specic primers for PR-1 andActin . the qRT-PCR result, we also performed an independent RT-PCR analysis on systemic leaves ( Figure 5C ) using the marker genes PR-1 and PAD4. The RT-PCR results were consistent with the qRT-PCR data. The results indicate that the expression of a subsetof genes involved in SAR were altered, both in timing and extentin the InsP 5-ptase plants. SIGNAL MOLECULES GENERATED IN InsP 5-ptase PLANTS The onset of SAR requires an array of mobile signals which aregenerated from the primary infected leaves (reviewed in Gao et al., 2014 ). These molecules are presumed to be translocated from local inoculated leaves to distal leaves through the phloemtissue. Phloem exudate collected from local leaves provides ameans to study the effects of the mobile signals. We performedexudate experiments to examine whether the signal moleculesgenerated from the local infected leaves in wild type can trig-ger the same response in InsP 5-ptase plants and vice versa. Theexperimental design is to mimic the process of delivering sig-nal molecules from primary infected leaves to systemic leaves bybypassing the plant delivery system. The exudate from infectedplants containing putative signal molecules was collected andinjected into healthy uninfected plants. In these experiments, PR- 1gene expression is expected to increase in the new leaves (similar to systemic leaves) upon injection in response to the presenceof the signal molecules. We found that exudates collected fromInsP 5-ptase plants were equally effective in inducing PR-1 gene FIGURE 5  The SAR response is delayed in the InsP 5-ptase plants. The SAR assay was carried out using wild type (Wt), vector control (C2) and two independent InsP 5-ptase lines (T6 and T8). Plants were either rstinoculated with PstDC3000 avrRpt2 (OD 6000.001, 7 105cfuml) (A), or 10 mM MgCl 2mock solution (B), then sprayed with PstDC3000 (OD 6000.004, 2 106cfuml) at day 0, 1, 2, or 3. Systemic leaves were harvested and the bacterial growth was quantied at day 4 post spray. Data is the average of three experiments SD. Each experiment has three plants per line. Results from Wt and C2 (WtC2), and T6 and T8 (T8T6) were pooled for analysis.P0.05(C)Systemic leaves were also harvested before (0) and after initial inoculation at 3, 8, 24, and 48 h forRT -PCR carried out with gene-specic primers for PR-1 ,PAD4 ,a n d UBQ10 . (D)For the exudate experiment, only Wt and T8 and their reciprocal treatments are shown. Leaves were harvested before or at 48 h post exudate (ex) or mock (m) inltration for RT -PCR carried out with gene-specic primers for PR-1 andActin . expression in wild type plants as exudates from wild type plants (Figure 5D ). However, InsP 5-ptase plants showed diminished PR-1 gene expression in response to exudates from either wild type or transgenic plants. These results indicate that the genera-tion of mobile signals at the primary infected site is not impairedin the InsP 5-ptase plants and the exudates were as effective asthose produced in wild type. Since the response to exogenousapplication of SA was also normal in the InsP 5-ptase plants(Figure 4B ), these results suggest that InsP 5-ptase plants are affected in either sensing the mobile signal andor in the synthesisof SA at the systemic site.

Ca2increase and gene expression were affected, although ROS generation was normal. Additionally, ETI responses occurringat the local infected leaves were compromised in InsP 5-ptaseplants leading to a reduced and delayed induction of the systemicresponse. A reduction in basal InsP 3levels is the most dramatic and direct consequence of the constitutive expression of InsP 5-ptasein the InsP 5-ptase transgenic Arabidopsis plants ( Perera et al., 2006, 2008 ). It is reasonable to speculate therefore, that the inabil- ity to propagate an InsP 3signal is the primary basis for the altered defense responses exhibited by these plants. However, we cannotrule out potential up and downstream effects of the increasedturnover of InsP 3, since InsP 3is an intermediate in the phos- phoinositide pathway and is linked to both the phospholipidsand the inositol phosphates. In previous work, we showed thatPIP5K activity and PtdInsP 2synthesis was upregulated in trans- genic tobacco cells in suspension culture expressing InsP 5-ptase(Perera et al., 2002 ). Under normal growth conditions, in our hands, we have not detected a up regulation of PtdInsP 2syn- thesis in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings or plants. It is possiblethat the InsP 5-ptase plants have altered localized perturbationsin membrane phospholipids under specic conditions (such ashydroponic growth, Knig et al., 2007 )o ri nr e s p o n s et os t i m u l i such as pathogens. InsP 3signaling in plants remains a controversial topic primar- ily due to the fact that at a molecular level, an InsP 3responsive Ca2channel (analogous to the animal InsP 3receptor) has not been identied in plant genomes (discussed in Krinke et al., 2007a; Munnik and Nielsen, 2011 ). Nevertheless, many studies have demonstrated that InsP 3is a physiological ligand (reviewed inKrinke et al., 2007a; Dodd et al., 2010; Pokotylo et al., 2014 ) and InsP 3changes occur rapidly and transiently in response to wide variety of both abiotic and biotic signalsstimuli (reviewedinKrinke et al., 2007a; Im et al., 2010 ). It has also been sug- gested that InsP 6rather than InsP 3is the ligand responsible for Ca2release from intracellular plant stores ( Lemtiri-Chlieh et al., 2003 ). Since InsP 3is an intermediate in the lipid-dependent route of InsP 6biosynthesis (reviewed in Gillaspy, 2011, 2013 ), increased InsP 3turnover could be expected to affect InsP 6levels and indeed the InsP 5-ptase plants have lower InsP 6levels compared to wild type ( Perera et al., 2008 ). Increased susceptibility to several micro- bial pathogens was reported in low InsP 6mutants ( Murphy et al., 2008 ). However, (unlike the InsP 5-ptase plants), these mutants had normal basal levels of SA and normal SA induction uponinfection. Therefore we cannot attribute all of the attenuateddefense responses of the InsP 5-ptase plants to a decrease inInsP 6. Other inositol phosphate intermediates, including InsP 4 and InsP 5are implicated in stress responses (reviewed in Pokotylo et al., 2014 ). It is conceivable that InsP 6(andor other inositol phosphates) act synergistically with InsP 3to mediate signaling leading to defense responses. ATTENUATION OF Ca2SIGNALS It is clear that both PTI and ETI share similar signal transduc- tion components and downstream targets (discussed in Ma and Berkowitz, 2007; Tsuda and Katagiri, 2010 ) and may represent an overlapping and interconnected network. The complexity of thissignaling network is illustrated by the convergence and crosstalkbetween parallel branches ( Boudsocq and Sheen, 2013 ). A rise in cytosolic Ca 2is one common signaling element in response to b o t hP T Ia n dE T Ia n dC a2may be a primary signal essential for initiating many of the early events; however there are differencesin the timing and duration of the PTI and ETI associated Ca 2 signals. Additionally there are feedback loops that modulate the propagation of the Ca2signal ( Ma and Berkowitz, 2007, 2011 ). We showed that the InsP 5-ptase seedlings have a greatly atten- uated Ca2signal in response to g22 compared to wild type (Figure 1B ). A similar result was reported using intact leaves exposed to g22 ( Ma et al., 2012 ). Intriguingly, the InsP 5-ptase plants exhibited a normal Ca2response to the plant derived peptide elicitor Pep3 ( Ma et al., 2012 ). The Pep receptor PEPR is linked to the cyclic nucleotide gated cation channel CNGC2(Qi et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, the cngc2 mutant showed an opposite Ca 2response to the InsP 5-ptase plants; an attenuated Ca2rise in response to Pep3 but a normal Ca2 response to g22 ( Ma et al., 2012 ). This result supports the involvement of different pathways of Ca2inux in response to Pep and g22. It was suggested that Pep primarily targets extra-cellular stores (via inux by CNGC2) while g22 may involve anadditional contribution from intracellular stores. Detailed stud-ies of the amplitude and kinetics of g22 dose-dependent Ca 2 changes also suggested that two processes or two different stores may be involved in the g22 induced Ca2response ( Jeworutzki et al., 2010; Ranf et al., 2011 ). A biphasic Ca2response was previously reported in response to avirulent pathogens ( Grant et al., 2000 ).Ma and Berkowitz (2007) proposed that the initial pathogen-associated Ca2rise is primarily via inux from the apoplast while the subsequent Ca2 rise is from intracellular stores. We observed that while the ini- tial Ca2peak was similar to wild type, the timing of the second Frontiers in Plant Science  Plant-Microbe Interaction June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 10Hung et al. InsP 3in plant defense responses FIGURE 6  Summary of InsP 5-ptase plants responses to g22 and Pseudomonas syringae .The major results described in the paper are listed. The transport of mobile signals from local to distal leaves was notinvestigated and is indicated by the ?.  PTI, PAMP triggered immunity; ETI, Effector triggered immunity; SA, salicylic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SAR, systemic acquired resistance. Ca2peak was delayed in the InsP 5-ptase plants ( Figure 3B ) which supports a role for InsP 3in sustaining and propagating the pathogen-associated cytosolic Ca2signal. Our results are consistent with a model in which InsP 3(and or its derivatives) may act in an intracellular Ca2relay which would be downstream of the initial Ca2inux from the apoplast. Because MAMP-triggered ROS was unaffected in the InsP 5-ptase plants we propose that the initial rise in cytosolic Ca 2in response to MAMP elicitation may activate some downstreamtargets (such as CDPKs) as well as trigger the early oxidative burst.Alternatively, the ROS response may be primed by BIK1 in aparallel Ca 2independent manner ( Kadota et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014 ). In plants several intracellular compartments serve as Ca2 stores (reviewed in Dodd et al., 2010 ). The InsP 3responsive Ca2 store is likely to be the ER or vacuole; however we cannot rule out the involvement of the chloroplast ( Manzoor et al., 2012 ). A plant specic Ca2sensor protein CAS, which is located in the chloroplasts, was recently shown to play a role in both PTIand ETI ( Nomura et al., 2012 ). There are shared similarities in the response of the cas-1 mutant and the InsP 5-ptase trans- genic plants in defense signaling, such as increased susceptibilityto both virulent and avirulent bacterial strains, basally reducedPR-1 gene expression and normal ROS generation in response to g22. However at present, we have no information on whetherInsP 3(andor InsP 6)m a ya f f e c tC a2stores in the chloroplast. The basal down regulation of PRgenes and the reduced activa- tion of PRgene expression in the InsP 5-ptase plants may also reect alterations in ER Ca2homeostasis as discussed further below.SA BIOSYNTHESIS AND SA MEDIATED SIGNALING InsP 5-ptase plants have low basal SA (under normal controlconditions) and when infected with avirulent pathogens, SA lev-els were lower than wild type plants at day 2 post inoculation(Figure 4 ), suggesting that SA biosynthesis maybe reduced in the transgenic plants. The reduced levels of SA in InsP 5-ptaseplants suggest a link between PI-metabolism and SA accumula-tionpathway through a yet unknown mechanism that ultimatelyaffects plant defense, either directly or indirectly. At a transcrip-tional level, based on previous microarray results ( Perera et al., 2008 ), we have not detected lower expression of the two key genes involved in SA biosynthesis, namely phenylalanine ammo-nia lyase ( PAL) and isochorismate synthase ( ICS1 ), (Wildermuth et al., 2001 ). ABA has been implicated as a negative regula- tor of SA due to their overlapping biosynthetic pathways ( de T orres Zabala et al., 2009 ;r e v i e w e di n Cao et al., 2011 ). However, we did not detect increased basal ABA levels in InsP 5-ptaseplants ( Perera et al., 2008 ). Another possibility is that expres- sion of genes encoding positive regulators of SA accumulation(reviewed in Lu, 2009; Ng et al., 2011 ), could be impaired in InsP 5-ptase plants, resulting in lowered SA levels. One of thesegenes is PAD4 , which showed a delayed induction in systemic leaves ( Ta b l e 2 ). Similar to InsP 5-ptase plants, mutants of this group of genes have reduced SA accumulation and enhanced sus-ceptibility to pathogens which could be rescued by exogenousSA treatment ( Zhou et al., 1998 ). Recent studies also point to the involvement of Ca 2calmodulin (CaM) in modulating SA biosynthesis. SARD1 and CBP60g, are two related transcriptionfactors which control SA biosynthesis by regulating ICS1 expres- sion. Interestingly, CBP60g is a calmodulin-binding protein and www.frontiersin.org June 2014  Volume 5  Article 267 11Hung et al. InsP 3in plant defense responses its activity is Ca2-dependent ( Zhang et al., 2010; Truman and Glazebrook, 2012 ). It is possible that the reduced Ca2response in InsP 5-ptase plants might affect induction and accumulationof SA via CBP60g activity. ATTENUATED GENE EXPRESSION We have reported that select early g22 responsive genes showedreduced expression at 120 min in the InsP 5-ptase plants(Figure 1E ). We suspect that some downstream transcriptional responses may require the continued propagation of the Ca 2 signal. We have also shown that the InsP 5-ptase plants have basally reduced levels of some defense-related genes ( Ta b l e 1 ). Additionally, induction of PR-1 was delayed in local leaves and several SAR related genes were either not induced or delayedin induction in systemic leaves ( Figure 2D ,Ta b l e 2 ). We sug- gest that these genes are in part under the control of SA andCa 2CaM which can regulate transcription by either directly or indirectly interacting with transcription factors (review Dong, 2004; Kim et al., 2009; Reddy et al., 2011 ). The DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor CAMTA (or SR) is enhancedby Ca 2CaM binding (review, Finkler et al., 2007 ). Arabidopsis CAMTA3 acts as a negative regulator of biotic stress responses.The loss-of-function mutants have elevated levels of SA andexhibit enhanced disease resistance. Additionally, several defense-associated genes (including PR genes) are found to be up-regulated in camta3 mutants ( Galon et al., 2008; Du et al., 2009 ). The cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) mutant cngc2 also shows constitutively high PR-1 gene expression and high SA production ( Chan et al., 2008 ). The phenotypes of both the camta3 and cngc2 mutants are opposite to what we observed in the InsP 5-ptase plants, which have low PR-1 gene expression and low SA levels. We have noted a striking inverse correla-tion between genes that are basally down regulated in the InsP5-ptase plants and genes that are upregulated in camta3 and cngc2 (Supplementary Table 4). Twelve of the basally upregulated genes in cngc2 , and thirteen of the upregulated genes in camta3 were found downregulated in InsP 5-ptase plants ( Perera et al., 2008 ) including PR-1 ,PR-2 ,a n d PR-5 (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, there was strong overlap between this subset ofgenes and the top 50 candidates in the PR-1 coexpression network as well as with genes that upregulated in wild type seedlings grownunder high Ca 2conditions ( Chan et al., 2008 ). These results are further support for Ca2mediated regulation of gene expression although at present, the exact mechanism of activation of theseover lapping genes is not known. SA is also implicated in the regulation of PRgene expression via the activation of the TGA (TGACG Motif-Binding Factor)transcription factors (review, Dong, 2004; Fu and Dong, 2013 ). Accumulation of SA affects the cellular redox and controls thetranslocation of the cofactor NPR1 into the nucleus where itbinds and activates TGAs. Most TGAs act as positive regulatorsto induce PR genes as well as the expression of genes encodingER resident proteins involved in protein folding and Ca 2stor- age. The induction of the protein secretory pathway is requiredfor SAR ( Wang et al., 2005 ) .I n s P5 - p t a s ep l a n t sh a v el o wb a s a llevels of PR-1 ,PR-5,CRT3 ,a n d BiP3 (Ta b l e 1 ), which may be in part due to low basal SA andor low ER Ca 2. In conclusion, we show that the constitutive expression of InsP 5-ptase affects Ca2release, expression of a subset of defense related genes and both basal and SAR responses but does notaffect ROS production. We favor the model postulated by Ranf et al. (2011) in which Ca 2acts as an onoff switch and a thresh- old level of Ca2is required for full activation of the downstream pathways. The InsP 5-ptase plants are impaired in their ability topropagate and maintain the Ca 2signal and therefore are unable to mount a full and robust defense response. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Imara Y.
