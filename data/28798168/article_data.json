These strains were isolated from the Japanese ExperimentModule (one strain), U.S. Harmony Node 2 (three strains), and Russian Segment ZvezdaModule (two strains). Among the six Bacillus cereus sensu lato strains reported here, three U.S. Harmony Node 2 isolates (ISSFR-3F, ISSFR-9F, and ISSFT-23F) and one Japanese Experiment Module isolate (JEM-2) were sequenced and assembled with both Illumina MiSeq andPacBio RSII sequence data. The remaining assemblies, including two Russian isolates,were sequenced and assembled with only MiSeq data. The MiSeq runs yielded onaverage 24 to 54 million 300-bp reads (from 1,402 H11003to 3,093 H11003average coverage), while PacBio yielded 4,000 to 116,000 reads (from 7 H11003to 202H11003average coverage) ( Table 1 ). Due to the extremely high coverage ( H110221,000H11003), Illumina MiSeq reads were randomly down-sampled to 100 H11003using an estimated genome size of 5.3 Mb, resulting in an average of 1.2 to 1.5 million paired-end reads per isolate. Next, the down-sampled readswere assembled using iMetAMOS ( 1) with IDBA_UD and SPAdes ( 2). IDBA_UD was selected as the best assembly for all six isolates. Low condence bases within theselected IDBA_UD ( 3) assemblies were masked out by mapping all reads to the assembled contigs and detecting conicting variants with FreeBayes ( 4). The PacBio reads were assembled following the methods described by Berlin et al. ( 5) with Celera Assembler version 8.3rc1 and polished with Quiver ( 6). A second round of polishing was performed post-Quiver using the available MiSeq data as input to Pilon ( 7). The six International Space Station (ISS) isolates were aligned (NUCmer  8, Parsnp 9) against members of the B. cereus sensu lato group genomes ( 10). The PacBio assemblies were used for all isolates with sufcient read coverage, and Illuminaassemblies were used for the remaining isolates. Based on genome size estimates (5.2to 5.3 Mb), NUCmer pairwise alignments ( H1102299.9 average pairwise nucleotide identity) and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic placement, all six isolates were found to exhibit a very high degree of similarity.Received 31 May 2017 Accepted 5 June 2017 Published 10 August 2017 Citation Venkateswaran K, Checinska Sielaff A, Ratnayake S, Pope RK, Blank TE, Stepanov VG,Fox GE, van Tongeren SP, Torres C, Allen J,Jaing C, Pierson D, Perry J, Koren S, Phillippy A,Klubnik J, Treangen TJ, Rosovitz MJ, BergmanNH. 2017.

However, none of the commonly known B. anthracis signature elements were identied. Specically, all six ISS isolates (i) contain the plcR ( 11) ancestral C allele, which has been used in large-scale phylogenetic analyses todistinguish B. anthracis strains from the rest of the B. cereus group; (ii) lack signicant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids; and (iii) are phylogenetically placedoutside of the B. anthracis clade. Results were consistent with a comparative genomic analysis performed using the Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryMicrobial Threat Characterization Pipeline. Altogether, the collective genomic evi-dence supports the conclusion that the six ISS isolates represent a novel Bacillus sp. located within the B. cereus sensu lato group. Accession number(s).
