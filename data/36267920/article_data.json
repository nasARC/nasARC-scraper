The muscle and the liver are among the most affected tissues during spaceight and their relationships in response to space exposure have never been studied. We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice onNASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceight using GSEA, ORA,and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid meta-bolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A specicgene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucosesparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand processgene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle. Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during spaceight,for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure. INTRODUCTION The presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back t o the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is esti- mated in the course of the 2030s ( Bukley, 2020 ). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more as- tronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanitys understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live inspace. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight mostplausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which antic ipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew t o colony of thousands of people ( Air Force Space Command, 2019 ). Over fty years after the rst foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetaryspecies. This endeavor is hampered by space stressors such as sp ace radiation, microgravity, connement, isola- tion, hostile conditions, and distance from Ea rth, that all induce physiological changes ( Afshinnekoo et al., 2020 ). These changes can be seen as physiological adaptation to the space environment, but they can become maladaptive and deleterious over time and upon gravity re-exposure during a planetary mission such as to Mars. Nine major spaceight systemic and physiological health risks have been identi-ed: cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairment, increased cancer risk, muscle degeneration, bone loss, liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation, circadian rhythm dysregulation, immune dysfunction, and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) ( Afshinnekoo et al., 2020 ). Mus- cle atrophy is a major risk for these missions as it impairs mobility, thus compromising critical missionoperations such as post-landing vehicle egress. Muscle atrophy is characterized by unbalanced protein d e g r a d a t i o na n dt h el o s so fm u s c l em a s s .H o w e v e r ,p r o t e i ns u p p l e m e n t a t i o nf a i l st oc o u n t e r a c tm u s c l e loss in sarcopenia, cachexia, and s paceight-induced muscle atrophy ( Gao and Chilibeck, 2020 ). Many studies have documented spaceight-induced muscle atrophy as a consequence of weightlessness and decreased muscle solicitation ( Fitts et al., 2000 ).

Despite the important advances in human physiology in space, the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are poorly under-stood. Therefore, molecular analyses are needed to enable a new countermeasure approach to monitor astronaut health and ensure safety of future habited space missions. The liver and the muscle are among the most affected tissues during spaceight. The liver and the muscle are two master organs of the metabolism, with the mus cle tissue representing up to 50 of the total body mass. Consistently, astronauts and living organisms exposed to space environment display many featuresof dysregulated metabolism. Rats on the SpaceLab-2 mission displaye d increased serum cholesterol levels ( Popova et al., 1999 ). In mice, activated lipotoxic pathway s are associated with abnormal live r lipid accumulation and increased lipid metabolism and lipid localization gene expression ( Jonscher et al., 2016 ;Beheshti et al., 2019 ). Be- heshti et al. recently showed using a multi-omic analysis that lipid dysregulation in mice liver and lipo- toxic pathways was a specic resp onse to space stressors alone ( Beheshti et al., 2019 ). Dysregulated lipid metabolism, especially lipid accumulation, is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty acid liver dis- eases (NAFLD), liver dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes ( Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005 ;Perry et al., 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2010 ). Of note, mice showed early signs of liver injury on a short space ight (STS-135), and subclinical diabe togenic changes have been shown t o occur during spaceight and bed- rest studies ( Jonscher et al., 2016 ;Tobin et al., 2002 ). In mice own aboard the B ION-M1 biosatellite, the transcriptome response of the longissimus dorsi was mainly linked to metabolism, especially insulin signaling and sensitivity, highlighting the impact of spaceight on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (Gambara et al., 2017a ). Glucagon and insulin, two hormones of glucose metabolism, were predicted to be the common upstream regulators of spaceight metabolic shift ( Beheshti et al., 2019 ). In the Twin Study, increased levels of lactic acid were found in the urine of the ight astronaut, consistent with me-tabolomics data showing an increased lactic acidp yruvic acid ratio suggesting a metabolic shift ( Garrett- Bakelman et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, insulin resistance and li ver diseases are associated with muscle at- rophy and a potential reciprocal inuence of insulin resistance and muscle disuse atrophy ( Chakravarthy et al., 2020 ;Meyer et al., 2020 ;Rudrappa et al., 2016 ;Samuel and Shulman, 2012 ). As such, metabolic stress is a priority research for human space exploration ( Bergouignan et al., 2016 ). The roles of the liver and the muscle are often interlinked, and muscle-liver crosstalk are described in metabolic diseasesNAFLD, NASH, IR, and diabetes ( Chakravarthy et al., 2020 ;Soeters and Soeters, 2012 ). However, the rela- tionship of the two organs in the response to s pace environment has not been yet elucidated. In this study, we describe for the rst time the relatio nship of the response of both the liver and the muscle of mice during spaceight using the R software package mixOmics widely used in the omic eld. The mixO- mics package enables datasets comparison, correlations , and associations visualization in various research areas ( Durue et al., 2021 ;Gonza lez et al., 2012 ). RESULTS Lipid metabolic processes are the most common biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceight Previous studies showed that the muscle and the liver are differentially affected by metabolic changes dur- ing spaceight ( da Silveira et al., 2020 ). Here, we rst investigated the commonalities between the two or- gans. We chose to focus on the quadriceps, which is the most important in term of size and as such poten-tially in terms of effects. Transcriptomic data from C57BL6J mouse liver an d quadriceps from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol were analyzed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method and visualized with Cyto-scape software ( Figure 1 A). In the quadriceps, fatty coA process and axon extension negative were the most enriched processes. In the liver, most enriched processes were related to mitochondria (proton triphosphate gsea, electron transport cytochrome, and mitochondrial translational elongation) fol-lowed by lipid metabolism-related processes (oxidation fatty acyl, plasma lipoprotein particle, and positive lipid process) ( Figure S1 A, Related to Figure 1 ). Similarly, lipid metabolism-related pathways were also the most enriched reported by KEGG pathways over representation analysis in the liver ( Fig- ure S1 B, Related to Figure 1 ).ll OPEN ACCESS 2 iScience 25, 105213, October 21, 2022iScienc e ArticleFigure 1.

Consistent with previous studies, mitochondria-related process genesets were also among the most shared processes and were upregulated in the liver, while downregulated in the quadriceps. Endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome-related process genesets were also among the most shared processgenesets, potentially suggesting impaired protein metabolism. Both positively (upregulated) and negatively (downregulated) enriched KEGG pathways obtained by GSEA for each organ were compared together in a Venn diagram ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Among the 70 pathways analyzed, 11 pathways were common to the two organs. Again, lipid metabolism -related pathways were the most represented among the common ones ( Figure 1 B), with KEGG_BIOSYNTHESIS_OF_UNSATUR- ED_FATTY_ACIDs and the two short chain fatty acid metabolism pathways KEGG_BUTANOATE_ME-TABOLISM and KEGG_PR OPANOATE_METABOLISM ( Figure 1 C). Protein metabolism (KEGG_RIBO- SOME, KEGG_PROTEASOME, KEGG_RNA_POLY MERASE) and DNA repair-related pathways were also among the common downregulated pathways between the two organs. Thus, spaceights induce astrong transcriptional response of the metabolism, especially for lipid metabolism in the liver and in the quadriceps. Hypoglycemic signaling pathways genes are t he most signicantly downregulated in mice quadriceps during spaceight In the quadriceps, 972 genes were sig nicantly differentially expresse d, among which 562 were downregu- lated and 410 were upregulated. KEGG pathways over representation analysis (ORA) in the online software Webgesalt reported 30 most enriched pathways ( Figure 2 A). Pathways involved in metabolism are partic- ularly enriched, especially those regulating glycemia: HIF1, ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and PI3K-Aktsignaling pathways. Hypoglycem ic signaling pathway gene expre ssion was decreased in ight mice compared to ground control mice ( Figure 2 B). Interestingly, glucose transport processes were among the most negatively enriched in GSEA reports, and glucose transport process gene expression wasdecreased in ight mice compared to ground control mice ( Figures 2 Ca n d2 D ) . We investigated the relationships between the downregulation of glucose transport process genes and the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathway genes using the supervised method sPLS-DA (sparse partial least square-differential analysis) with the R-mixOmics package. We compared the reported genes by the sPLS-DA performed at 100 (22657), 75 (16992) , 50 (11328), and 25 (5664) (according to the pro- cess suggested in Durue et al., 2021 ) transcript input in a Venn diagram, and we found that 3463 genes were commonly reported with the strongest importance for discrimination (discriminating genes) ( Fig- ure S2 A, Related to Figure 2 ). KEGG pathways ORA on these specic genes reported several enriched pathways among which were the previously mentioned hypoglycemic signaling pathways. Moreover,491 signicant differentially expressed genes (DEG ) were still present among the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes, and KEGG pathway ORA on these genes demonstrated fewer enriched pathways than on the orig- inal analysis of the 972 DEG ( Figure 2 A) and on the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes ( Figure S2 A, Related to Figure 2 ), but the hypoglycemic ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and HIF-1 signaling pathways were still among the most enriched ( Figure S2 B, Related to Figure 2 ). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that in- ight mice and ground control mice groups were clearly discriminated by gene variability ( Figure S2 C, Related to Figure 2 ), despite PCA being an unsupervised method. Finally, we found that glucose transport process and hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression correlate ( Figure 2 E), and this correlation is strong as indicated by the correlation intensity level shown on the correlation heatmap ( Figure S2 D, Related to Figure 2 ). Muscle glucose transport gene expression correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation processes gene expression In the quadriceps, DNA repair, autophagy, and tra nslation are among the most enriched processes and pathways reported by GSEA and ORA. DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process genes aredecreased in inight mice compared to ground control mice ( Figures 3 A3C). Muscle glucose transport gene expression strongly correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translationll OPEN ACCESS 4 iScience 25, 105213, October 21, 2022iScienc e Articleprocess gene expression as shown by the correlation circle plot ( Figures 3 D3F) and the correlation heat- map ( Figures 3 G3I). These processes are both high energy demand processes. Thus, decreased energy intake gene expression correlated with an energy-saving transcriptome in mice quadriceps during spaceight. Lipid metabolic processes gene expression in the liver correlates with gene expression changes in the muscle and muscle atrophy phenotype Lipid metabolism pathways are amon g the most reported by GSEA and ORA ( Figures 1 and S1). In addition, discriminating genes after 100, 75, 50, and 25 sPLS-DA and post DEG 100, 75, 50, and 25 sPLS-DA still maintain this pattern as shown by KEGG ORA ( Figures S3 A and S3B, Related to Figure 4 ). Of note, the two short chain fatty acid butanoate  and propanoate were always among the most en- riched KEGG pathways ( Figure S3 C, Related to Figure 4 ). Since fatty liver diseases are associated with IR and diabetes, we investigated whether altered glucose transport gene expression was linked to liver lipid metabolism. We found that glucose transport process gene expression strongly correlated with liver lipid Figure 2.

DISCUSSION Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceight, it is a fact that humans have become a space-faring species.

Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceight-induced physiological changes ( da Silveira et al., 2020 ). Mitochondria are complex organelles inside the cell where fundamental biomolecules are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TC A) and coupled to energy production by the electron transport chain. Thus, mitochondria play a key role in metabolism and energy management. Here, we found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the quadriceps and the livertranscriptome in mice during spaceight. Impaired lipid metabolism and fatty acid accumulation is asso- ciated with muscle atrophy. Of note, butanoate an d propanoate metabolism were the most affected in the two organs analyzed, decreased in the liver while increased in the muscle. Butanoate and propanoate,also known as butyrate and propionate, are short chain fatty acids produced in the intestinal lumen by bac-terial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, especially resistant starch, dietary ber, and to a lesser extent proteins. Resistant starch is found in some grains, beans, and legumes. The gut microbiome is disturbed during spaceight; astronauts gut microb iome showed an alteration in the composition pattern o fb a c t e r i ao ft h ep h y l u mF i r m i c u t e s ,t h em a i nb u t y r a t e - p r o d u c i n gb a c t e r i ai nt h eh u m a ng u t( Venegas et al., 2019 ), with the presence of different genus increasing or decreasing during spaceight but also showing a consistent decrease in bacteria from the taxa Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia, also knownt op r o d u c eb u t y r a t ei nt h ei n t e s t i n e( Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019 ;Voorhies et al., 2019 ;Venegas et al., 2019 ). Microbiome analysis from RR1 mice showed an overal l increase of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, but the authors linked that to similar alterations that occur with aging ( Jiang et al., 2019 ). This Firmicute increase in older mice is seen as a sign of dysbiosi s and this alteration was shown to be followed by a C2470 decrease in butyrate levels ( Spychala et al., 2018 ) .T h eu p r e g u l a t i o no fb u t y r a t ea n dp r o p i o n a t ep a t h - w a y si nt h em u s c l ec a nr e  e c tap o s s i b l en e e df o rt h e s ef atty acids and derivatives. In this context, dietary changes could represent a feasible countermeasure to spaceight-induced physiological changes. The TCA cycle activity and the glycolysisgluconeogenesis ratio are decreased in muscle during spaceight suggesting disturbed energy production. Consistently, we found that spaceight induced a hyperglycemicresponse in mouse muscle involving the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor (HIF, ErbB, AMPK, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt). This signaling response mostly affected g l u c o s ei m p o r tg e n ee x p r e s s i o n .I na d d i t i o n ,h i g he n e r g yd e m a n dp r o c e s s e ss u c ha sD N Ar e p a i r ,a u t o -phagy, and translation gene expression were decrea sed in inight mice quadriceps, suggesting a shift toward an energy-saving mode in the muscle during spaceight. The muscle is a high energy demand or- gan. Since the muscle represent up to 50 of the total body mass, its metabolism radically affects glucoseavailability in the body. Consequently, glucose sparing and energy saving by the muscle in detrimental con-ditions can compensate for the energy needs of other such as the brain that requires stable and continuous glucose supply. Oxidative stress and DNA damage overload, that can impair mitochondrial function and the metabolism, are examples of detrimental conditions occurring during spaceight ( Afshinnekoo et al., 2020 ;Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019 ). Also, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to muscle at- rophy ( Abrigo et al., 2019 ). The HIF-1 signaling enric hed pathways suggest that oxidative stress occurred in RR1 inight mice. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote insulin resistance and diabetes(Bashan et al., 2009 ;Di Meo et al., 2017 ;Sivitz and Yorek, 2010 ). Our results, in line with previous space studies, suggest an insulin resistance phenotype. Meanwhile, insulin resistance has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism to spare glucose that can benet survival in various states such as starvation,immune activation growth, and cancer ( Soeters and Soeters, 2012 ). Insulin resistance and diabetes are often associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver diseases. Fatty acids inhibit the insulin signaling pathways by directly interfering in the signaling through diacylgly-cerol or by overloading the TCA with the precursor acetyl CoA ( Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005 ;Perry et al., 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2010 ). During spaceight, liver lipid metabolic gene expression correlated with muscle glucose import gene expression in RR1 mice. Insulin resistance, NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH), and cirrhosis are associated with muscle atrophy and their severity correlates positively ( Chakra- varthy et al., 2020 ;Meyer et al., 2020 ;Samuel and Shulman, 2012 ). During a stress starvation, fatty acids together with ketone bodies become the primary source of energy for cells while peripheral organs suchas the muscle, but also the skin and bones, provide amin o acids taken up by central organs such as the liver, the spleen, immune cells, and healing tissues, ultimately leading to protein loss ( Soeters and Soeters, 2012 ). During a spaceight, all cells are exposed to sp ace stressors such as radiation, endocrine systemll OPEN ACCESS iScience 25, 105213, October 21, 2022 9iScienc e Articleperturbation induced by altered circadian rhythm or psychological issues, and microgravity, all promoting oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysf unction. In addition, it has been shown that space- ight induces a shift from slow aerobic and highly enriched mitochondria muscle bers (slow ber, type I) toward fast anaerobic and fast low-enriched mitochondria muscle ber (fast ber, type II) ( Gambara et al., 2017b ;Ulanova et al., 2015 ) .M i t o c h o n d r i aa r et h em a j o rs o u r c eo fr e a c t i v eo x y g e ns p e c i e s .A ss u c h , spaceight-induced ber shift and mitochondrial dysfunction can be seen as a biological mechanism to decrease mitochondrial activity and mitigate oxidative stress. If mitochondrial stress is a central biological hub during spaceight, and if the mitochondria are the master organelle of metabolism regulation and en-ergy management, we can then expect a general metabolic shift in the body toward a starvation-like phenotype that promotes decreased mitochondrial a ctivity, decreased metabolism and protein loss in the muscle, and increased lipid metabolism in the liver, to the benet of all body cells during spaceight.Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle DNA repair, auto-phagy, translation, and nally muscle atrophy phen otype gene expression. Butanoate and propanoate metabolism-related genes were still among the one with the strongest correlation. Interestingly, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation improve mitochondrial function, fat accumulation, insulinresistance, diabetes, and liver diseases ( Gao et al., 2009 ;Khan and Jena, 2016 ;Mollica et al., 2017 ;Ye et al., 2018 ;Zhang et al., 2019 ;Zhou et al., 2018 ). Moreover, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplemen- tation decreased muscle atrophy in various conditions ( Chang et al., 2001 ;Tang et al., 2022 ;Walsh et al., 2015 ). Thus, butyrate supplementation or dietary modication to stimulate microbial production repre- sents simple options to counteract muscle atrophy while preventing insulin resistance and lipid accumula- tion during spaceight. Gambara et al. previously identied insulin- and glucose metabolism-linked transcripts as main DEG in BION-M1 biosatellite own mice longissimus dorsi . In the present study, 17 and 13 differentially expressed genes in the liver and the muscle, respectively, were common to the 89 previously identied ( Gambara et al., 2017a ).Acas1a, Cpt2, Agt, Lcn2, and Prkcd , which were among the most DEG in Gambaras study were not found signicantly differentially expressed neither in the liver nor the quadriceps in the present study. The present study is based on the analyses of discriminating genes identied by the spls-DA per-formed with the mixOmics script. This method is designed to identify variations that are correlated, here gene expression in the liver and gene expression i n the quadriceps. Also, 31 over the 9753, among which Agt and Cpt2, and 24 over the 3463 discriminating genes i n the liver and the quadriceps, respectively, were in common with the 89 of the Gambaras study. These differences may reect the variability of gene expres- sion between the different muscle types. Nonetheless, in line with the literature, both converge to an altered insulin transcriptome, thus highlighting a general adaptive response in muscle during spaceightdespite different molecular pathways. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of discrimi-nating genes over DEG in deciphering omic data. We found that discriminating genes are mainly linked to lipid metabolism in the liver and insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the quadriceps. This means that lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver correlates with insulin signaling and glucose metabolismgene expression in the quadriceps in mice during spaceight. We identied a cluster of lipid metabolism processes-related genes in the liver, including Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Ser- pina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1, correlating the most with glucose transport gene expression and potentially in- sulin resistance in the muscle. Among these genes, some are already described for their insulin sensitivity. Fabp2, Abcg5, and Abcg8 genes polymorphisms are associated with insulin sensitivity while Apom might protect against insulin resistance ( Gylling et al., 2004 ;Kurano et al., 2020 ;Weiss et al., 2002 ;Yu et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, Sestrin 1 ( Sesn1 ), a well-known regulator of cell metabolism upregulated in longissimus dorsi of BION-M1 mice, was reported as a discriminating gene in both the liver and the quadriceps ( Gambara et al., 2017a ).Sestrin proteins are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and insulin signaling ( Lee et al., 2013 ). Sesn1 together with the present lipid metabolism-related gene clus- ter may thus account in insulin resistance research. The liver inuence on quadriceps gene expression we identied needs to be carried out by organ commu- nication mechanisms and we identied hepatokines as the most likely effector. Hepatokines are proteins secreted by the liver that can modulate signaling pathways associated with energy metabolism in the mus- cle and inuence the development of chronic metabolic diseases ( Seo et al., 2021 ). Important for our context, an increased blood concentration of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin increases insulin sensi- tivity, muscle hypertrophy, and mitochondrial function and diminishes fat mass in the muscle ( Seo et al., 2021 ). Interestingly, increased concentration of Fetuin-A showed to have the inverse effect of the previouslyll OPEN ACCESS 10 iScience 25, 105213, October 21, 2022iScienc e Articledescribed hepatokines ( Jensen-Cody and Potthoff, 2021 ;Seo et al., 2021 ). The levels of Fetuin-A increase after 60 day of bed rest, a ground model for micrograv ity effects, and we found in the literature a positive correlation between the Fetuin-A levels and the gene expression of Serpina6 and Rdh7, two genes we iden- tied in our gene cluster ( Herrmann et al., 2020 ;Thakur et al., 2008 ;Ward et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, Fetuin-A, as well as FGF21 and ANGPTL4 genes are among the correlating genes in the liver of mice duringspaceight reported by the liver versus quadriceps sPLS-DA. We hypothesize that the gene expression cor- relation identied in our work likely involves an increased Fetuin-A production by the liver and a diminished production of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin. In conclusion, we described for the rst time a strong correlation between liver lipid metabolism gene expression and the downregulation of hypoglycem ic and energy demand process-related genes. In the light of current knowledge, our result suggests that a starvation-like phenotype could promote a metabolicshift toward an energy-saving mode, resource sparring, and lipid mobilization through a tight liver-muscle crosstalk contributing to muscle atrophy during spaceight. Dietary changes based on starch supplemen- tation and microbiome modulation represent an affordable and sustainable countermeasure to supportour planetary goals and outer space settlement. Meanwhile, improving food habits and body energy moni- toring is an overall human chal l e n g eb o t ho nE a r t ha n db e y o n d . Limitations of the study Sample size was only six mice to match sample availability in the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome. Future space studies should be designed to match individuals for any factors (organs, environmental pa- rameters, psychological parameters, etc.). Here, we studied biological processe s and pathways at a transcriptional level. Transcription regulation, post-transcriptional stabilization, and post-translational modications impact cell response from gene expression to the nal protein activity. In addition, transcriptomics provides a static view of one single moment in the cell. However, spatial repartition also impacts molecular dynamics, and a transcriptionalecosystem theory has been dened ( Silveira and Bilodeau, 2018 ). To further understand the biological sig- nicance of the transcriptomic response to spaceigh t in mice quadriceps, both functional analysis and multi-omics studies are needed. Additional factors account for inducing muscle atrophy during spaceight. Circadian rhythm pathways genes are among those enriched in both the quadriceps and the liver in mice during spaceight(Figure S1 B, Related to Figures 1 and 2A), and circadian rhythm perturbation is associated with muscle at- rophy ( Choi et al., 2020 ). Astronauts experience continuous circ adian rhythm stressors on board the ISS, with sixteen sunsets per day and sustained articial light exposure as the only illumination source. However,assessing and deciphering circadian rhythm dynamics and correlation at molecular levels require properprotocol and experimental design (Zeitgeber time method) that should be implemented in future space biology research. We used the method implemented in mixOmics between the same molecular variables. This method is a powerful tool to compare any types of datasets. In this context, multiple variables comparisons, e.g., tem- perature variation inside the spacecrafts, food intake levels, dietary type, cognitive performances, psycho-logical parameters, and allowing multiscale comparisons, will considerably widen our understanding of spaceights impact on living organisms. The list of possible datasets combinations is innite, as much as the number of studies which can raise from.

Briey, the study was conducted aboard the Internat ional Space Station (ISS) in 2014 on twelves female C57BL6J mice, six in ight mice ( M23, M24, M25, M26, M27, M28) referred to as the FLT group, and six ground controls mice (M33, M34, M35, M36, M37, M38), referred to as the GC group, for 37 days upon 12h daynight cycle, and fed with Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)63. The research platform used for this experiment was NASAs Rodent Research Hardware System also referred to as the RodentResearch Habitat System. Mice were sacriced with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocationo no r b i to nt h eI S Sf o rt h eF L Tg r o u p ,a n do nt h eg r o u n da tt h es a m et i m ef o rt h eG Cg r o u p .T h ee n t i r e c a r c a s s e so f1 0m i c ew e r es t o r e da t C080C until processing. Two FLT mice were dissected on-board the ISS, and livers were isolated on-orbit and stored in the MELFI. Frozen FLT mice carcasses were then re-turned on Earth by the SpaceX-4 spacecraft and delivered to the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) for disposal. The ten frozen mice carcasses, GC and FLT, were dissected at room temperature, and harvested samples stored at C080C. RNA extraction from 2030mg mice liver and muscle w ere realized at 4C using a lysis buffer (Qiagen, Va- lenica, CA) and a beta-mercaptoethanol (1:100)Buffe r RLT solution, lysis buffer ( Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice. Samples were then homogenized for 2 0 s at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at room temperature to remove tissue debris. RNA from homogenates were furtherpuried using the Qiagen AllPrep DNARNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and eluted in DNaseRNase-free water. RNA concentrations were measured usi ng the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientic, Waltham , MA), and RNA quality was assessed u sing the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA seque ncing and library construction was performed on 1 mg of RNA having RIN values of 7 or above, using Illu mina HiSeq 4000 kit and ex perimental protocol. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS RNAseq data processing Raw FASTQ les were proceed using the GeneLab RNAseq data processing protocol as reported at https:genelab-data.ndc.nasa.g ovgenelabaccessionGLDS-103 and https:genelab-data.ndc.nasa. govgenelabaccessionGLDS-168 . On this work we used the mentioned protocol up to the step Quanti- cation data was imported to R (version 3.6.0) with tximport. R Differential Expression (DE) analysis has been perfo rmed using the R studio software Version 1.2.5001 and the DESeq2 package version 1.30.1 that uses shrinkage estimation for dispersion and fold change. RSEM expected counts were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. Sta-tistical signicance of differentially expressed genes (FDR 0.05) were assessed using Benjamini- Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure. Biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis For biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis, normalized count from RR1 mice quadri-ceps and liver were processed by the DEseq2 package and assessed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways Over Representation Analysis on the online Webgesalt platform, and for Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) and KEGG pathways GeneSets Enrichment by the Gene Set Enrich-ment Analysis (GSEA) software. The Cytoscape software was used to build geneset networks from GSEA results. GSEAs were run with a Flight vs Ground Control comparison setting. The ranked list of genes was dened by the signal-to-noise metric, and the st atistical signicance were determined by 1000 permu- tations of the gene sets. Enrichment importance were sorted according to the enrichment score calculated by GSEA ( Muller, 2019 ). Venn diagrams were generated on the online platform Venny available at: https: bioinfogp.cnb.csic.estoolsvennyindex2.0.2.html .ll OPEN ACCESS 16 iScience 25, 105213, October 21, 2022iScienc e ArticlemixOmics mixomics is a R package developed by Kim-anh Le Cao, Se bastien De jean and collaborators to visualize associations between paired omics datasets using c orrelation circles plots, heatmaps, and networks ( Duru- eet al., 2021 ;Gonza lez et al., 2012 ;Rohart et al., 2017 ). In the present study we used mixOmics package version 6.14.1. More information can be found on the online mixOmics platform available at: http: mixomics.org . sPLS and sPLS-DA Transcriptome from 6 matched NASA RR1 mice, 3 gr ound controls (M36, M37, M38) and 3 inight (M25, M26, M28), between the liver and the quadriceps were analyzed by sPLS (Partial Least Square) and sPLS- DA (sparse Partial Least Square-Differential Analysis). Correlation circle and correlation network were generated from sPLS-DA performed on 100, 75, 50, and 25 of total normalized counts according to the process suggested in Durue et al. (2021) . This method is an internal method to validate that the pattern of genes evaluated with the strongest importance for discrimination maintain across input reduc- tion. These genes are referred to as to discriminating genes in this study. The correlation circle plot is a 1sized radius were variable pools loc ated between 0,5 and 1 have the strongest correlation. Correlation heatmaps are generated from sPLS analyses. Pos t 100, 75, 50, and 25 sPLS-DA DEG are DEG still present in reported genes from 100, 75, 50, and 25 sPLS-DA.
