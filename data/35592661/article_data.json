Introduction Human pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by space ight. Under- standing the effects that space ight may have on the adaptation and tness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treat- ment and prevention options is limited. This is even more important in the context of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which typically produce benign infections, until they are challenged by certain environmental conditions or when host immune impairments occur, which can then equip them with the ability to cause serious health concerns  1. One such environmental condition is space ight, which has beendemonstrated to convert opportunistic pathogens to primary pathogens, enabling them to take advantage of a compromised immune system that may occur to astronauts during space ight  2,3. In line with this, there is mounting evidence that primary bacterial pathogens often undergo a diversity of signi cant phenotypic shifts during space ight, including increased antibiotic resistance  4,5,6,7, increased virulence  8,9,10, 11, and morphological changes associated with pathogenicity  12. Despite mounting research in these primary pathogens, much less is known about phenotypic shifts that occur to opportunistic pathogens when exposed to microgravity. Speci cally, there is little known about how pathogens may be utilizing nutrients differently in the microgravity environment of space compared to ground microbes, and potentially how  Corresponding author.

Due to increased nosocomial reports, the human opportunistic bac- teria, Serratia marcescens, has emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance  13,14.S. marcescens is a ubiquitous pathogen that occupies a wide variety of habitats and hosts. It can adapt quickly to antibiotics independently and simultaneously, which is likely due to the loss of conserved genetic elements and large genomic diversity among strains  14,15,16. Furthermore, S. marcescens was found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station  17,18. Therefore, this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for space ight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts that are more suscep- tible to opportunistic pathogens and especially considering the compli- cations with antibiotic resistance  2,18. Research in our laboratory has demonstrated that there is a signi - cant shift in virulence with S. marcescens (Db11) after space ight. When cultured aboard the International Space Station, S. marcescens Db11 kil- led healthy ground-reared Drosophila melanogaster hosts signi cantly faster than an identical control of the bacteria that was cultured on the ground  11. However, the speci c mechanisms of increased Db11 virulence and reduced D. melanogaster survival are currently unknown. In line with this, increased virulence is observed with various space and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)-isolated bacteria, including studies with Salmonella 19, and Staphylococcus aureus 20, which pose a threat to astronaut health during space ight. Our prior research has shown that Serratia marcescens also shows a signi cant increase in host lethality of D. melanogaster after growth in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions  11. Since space ight studies are costly and can be dif cult to perform due to constraints on experimental design and the availability of space ight opportunities, many researchers perform ground-based studies using devices such as the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity21,22,23. The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles, thereby creating a low uid shear environment that simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during space ight  24 and is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated such that the axis of rotation is perpen- dicular to the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental ef- fects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earths gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g) without continuous suspension while acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the vessel itself. Although this method is not an exact recreation of the space ight environment, the effects of the LSMMG environment have been demonstrated to recapitulate nd- ings from space ight studies  10,11. Drosophila melanogaster , as used in this study, has proven to be a useful host model for space ight and ground-based studies in the past. This is due to their well-characterized innate immune system, tractable genetics, ease of use, short life-cycle, genetic homology to mammalian systems, and low resource requirements for breeding large colonies  11, 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. In the current study, we use LSMMG to investigate the speci c mechanisms that enable microgravity-treated Serratia marcescens bacte- ria to kill the host D. melanogaster more quickly than control bacterial cultures. A screen of several genes related to known S. marcescens viru- lence factors did not reveal any differences of expression in LSMMGcompared to RWV-Control. Further testing revealed a LSMMG-dependent overexpression of the gene asparagine synthetase B ( asnB), which is implicated in virulence and resistance to drugs in other pathogenic bacteria  36,37. This gene is involved with amino acid metabolism and has been linked to both pathogen growth and virulence  38. Aminoacids like asparagine are thought to be important to the competition between hosts and pathogens in determining the outcome of an infection 38. Since our previous study indicated that the LSMMG-reared S. marcescens killed the host faster after infection  11 than control S. marcescens cultures, we wanted to explore whether the asparagine pathway might be linked to the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG treatment. Here, we show that LSMMG treatment causes a change in the expression of key asparagine pathway related genes in S. marcescens with a concomitant increase in host mortality. Further, we nd that these changes in key asparagine pathway genes and increased host mortality can be recapitulated in an LSMMG-speci c manner by the addition of aspartate and glutamine (the substrates of asparagine synthesis) to minimal media. We also show that the addition of L-asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine, can mitigate the LSMMG-induced increase in host virulence. Thus, this study allows us to understand the phenotypic shifts occurring in microbes exposed to altered gravity, and more speci cally, how amino acid metabolism may affect the mortality rate of the host. In addition, these results will allow us to explore the asparagine pathway further and develop countermeasures that target amino acid biosynthesis in opportunistic pathogens such as S. marcescens, as an essential consid- eration to maintain host health during space ight. 2. Results 2.1. The asparagine pathway and extracellular asparagine and glutamine concentrations are affected by simulated microgravity treatment of S. marcescens Our previous ndings have indicated that S. marcescens exposed to LSMMG for 24 h grow at a faster rate inside the host after infection and caused increased host lethality in D.melanogaster 11. First, we looked at several genes involved in agella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see signi cant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control bacteria ( Table 3 ). We, therefore, looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms and found that genes related to asparagine metabolism were upregulated inLSMMG. More speci cally, we found that there was a signi cant upre- gulation in asnB (asparagine synthetase B), which is a gene that regulates the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine (Figure 1 A,B). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of genes that are important for asparagine and glutamine metabolism. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression level of the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B) was 39.17 fold higher in LSMMG-treated cells relative to the RWV-control (P 0.0001), as well as a 10.5 fold increase in expression of L-asparaginase ( L-ap,P0.054), but there was no signif- icant difference in expression for the other genes tested, although several genes showed a positive trend for expression levels: L-ap1 (L-aspar- aginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidaseL-asparaginase), or astL(asparagine tRNA ligase) ( Figure 1 D). asnB is a gene that catalyzes the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine, and is known to be linked to virulence and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens  36,37. The L-asparaginase subunits assist with asparagine catabolism and nitrogen homeostasis 39, therefore, an overexpression of these genes suggests that there is an increase in asparagine catabolism as part of the overall homeostatic regulation of the asparagine pathway. The observation that asnB expression is signi cantly increased, led us to hypothesize that there is an increased presence of asparagine in LSMMG that may contribute to the increase in pathogen growth rate, and therefore an increase in consumption of glutamine and aspartate in the media. To con rm this, we quanti ed the rates at which S. marcescens utilized extracellular glutamine and asparagine in the nutrient-rich LB media, in order to see whether the consumption rates of these amino acids matched the increased growth of the bacteria in LSMMG. For asparagine measurements ( Figure 1 C), there was no difference betweenR. Gilbert et al. Heliyon 8 (2022) e09379 2the RWV-control and the LSMMG at 0 h (F 4.348, P 0.11) or at 14 h (F0.007, P 0.939). At 6 h of growth, LSMMG had signi cantly lower extracellular asparagine than the RWV-Control (F 1540.68, P  0.0001). Similarly, extracellular glutamine ( Figure 1 D) was not signi - cantly different at hours 0 (F 2.251, P 0.208) or 14 (F 0.669, P  0.459), but LSMMG had signi cantly lower glutamine at hour 6 (F  282.056, P 0.0001). These results suggest that the S. marcescens in LSMMG are consuming extracellular glutamine and asparagine more quickly during the active growth phase of the culture, which is consistent with the increase in growth that we see in LSMMG-reared bacteria in rich media  11. Taken together, the almost 40-fold overexpression of the asnB gene in LSMMG coupled with the overexpression of the asparaginase subunits (Figure 1 B), along with the increased consumption of asparagine (Figure 1 C), indicated that the asparagine pathway was likely to play a signicant role in the phenotypic changes observed in S. marcescens under reduced gravity LSMMG conditions. 2.2. S. marcescens growth is affected by L-asparaginase treatment in vitro under simulated microgravity conditions Since we saw an increase in asparagine consumption with LSMMG treatment, we studied whether the depletion of exogenous L-asparagine using the enzyme L-asparaginase would negatively in uence growth in LSMMG. When S. marcescens was grown in LSMMG with asparaginase, growth was signi cantly lower than the LSMMG without asparaginase at hours 18 (P 0.034), 21 (P 0.0004), and 24 (P 0.0008) of growth (Figure 2 B). For the RWV-Control sample, asparaginase reduced growth only at hour 15 (P 0.031), but not at any other timepoints. The LSMMG asparaginase growth was signi cantly lower than the RWV-Control at hour 18 (P 0.0296) but was not signi cantly different from the control at any other time point ( Figure 2 B). These results provide evidence that L-asparaginase reduces the growth of S. marcescens in the LSMMG condi- tion compared to the control, but does not signi cantly impact growth in the control samples, suggesting that the growth-suppressive effect of L- asparaginase is LSMMG-speci c. 2.3. Injection of LSMMG S. marcescens with in vivo L-asparaginase treatment reduces lethality in the D. melanogaster host Next, since the synthesis of asparagine by S. marcescens was closely linked with LSMMG treatment, we investigated whether L-asparaginase could mitigate increased virulence of LSMMG-reared pathogens after injection into a host as measured by host mortality. To do this, LSMMG or RWV-Control-treated S. marcescens were injected into D. melanogaster hosts, and the infected hosts were then injected again with L-aspar- aginase 1 h after bacterial infection. There was no difference in overall y survival between the LSMMG and the LSMMG asparaginase treatment in the early part of the survival curve indicating that there was no harmful effect from asparaginase injections of the host ( Figure 2 C, P 0.0976). However, when the survival curve was analyzed for the latter half of the experiment (12 24 h) when the majority of the host death typically occurs from an S. marcescens infection, then there was a sig- nicant difference in survival with and without asparaginase treatment. We demonstrated that the LSMMG-injected ies died faster than the LSMMG with asparaginase treatment ( Figure 2 C, Risk Ratio 2.92, P  0.0197). There was no difference between the RWV-Control with water or with asparaginase ( Figure 2 D, Risk Ratio 1.33, P 0.348). For the complete result of this statistical analysis, please see Table 1 . These re- sults indicate that the addition of exogenous asparaginase into the host, during infection with S. marcescens, can inhibit the increased S. marcescens virulence that is associated with reduced gravity treatment of the microbe ( Figure 2 C). L-asparaginase does not prevent host death and does not affect the time-course of host lethality in the RWV-Control Figure 1.

Both aspartate and glutamine supplementation in combination are required in minimal media to recapitulate the asparagine pathway gene expression changes seen in rich media Next, we examined the effect of speci c amino acids that are sub- strates in the asparagine synthesis pathway, on bacterial growth kinetics and gene expression. To do this, we grew S. marcescens in a minimal media supplemented with glutamine, aspartate, or both amino acids together, in LSMMG and in the RWV-Control. For all amino acid growth measures, there was no signi cant difference between the LSMMG and RWV-Control S. marcescens , except for the aspartate-supplemented sam- ple at 24 h ( Figure 3 D, F1.76, P 0.0023). This suggests that aspartate in isolation is suf cient to stimulate the LSMMG-speci c increase in growth. However, when we looked at how these growth conditions in uenced gene expression, the expression level of 38.95 relative to the RWV-control was signi cantly higher for the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B) in the combined glutamine and aspartate supplemented media but not in the media with either glutamine or aspartate alone ( Figure 3 E, P0.0001). Similarly, the gene L-ap (L-asparaginase) with a relative expression value of 21.45 was signi cantly higher in the combined media than in the glutamine or aspartate media alone (P 0.0001). There was no signi cant difference across media conditions for the other genes tested: L-ap1 (L- asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidaseL- asparaginase), or astL(asparagine tRNA ligase). This suggests that while aspartate alone can increase the growth of S. marcescens in LSMMG in minimal media, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are neces- sary to induce the LSMMG-speci c overexpression of asnB at a similar level to the nutrient-rich media ( Figure 1 B and Figure 3 E). Figure 2. Exogenously added L-asparaginase can inhibit growth of LSMMG-treated bacteria and reduce host-lethality. A) The breakdown of asparagine catalyze db y the asparaginase enzyme. B) The starting concentration of 1 C2108CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37C14C in LB media. One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase was added to the growth media, and growth of bacteria estimated by absorbance at 600 nm was measured every 3 h. L-asparag inase addition in vitro reduces the rate of growth most signi cantly in the LSMMG samples. Error bars represent one standard error. C and D) Bacteria were grown in RWV with LB media only. After 24 h of growth, bacteria were xed in 20 glycerol for injections. Flies were injected with S. marcescens . One hour after infection, ies were then injected with a treatment of L-asparaginase, or sterile water (no treatment). The LSMMG bacteria kills ies at a lower rate when L-asparaginase is injected in vivo (C) and similarly in vivo injected L-asparaginase does not impact survival of the RWV-Control (D).

Gilbert et al. Heliyon 8 (2022) e09379 42.5. Maximal host mortality rates of D. melanogaster are seen only when minimal media is supplemented with aspartate and glutamine, substrates of asparagine synthesis Given the signi cantly increased expression of asnB in LSMMG-grown bacteria in minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, it was important to test whether bacteria grown in this way would also increase its virulence in the D. melanogaster host. In the minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, ies injected with the bacteria grown in LSMMG died faster than those injected with bacteria grown in the RWV-Control (Ratio 2.46, P  0.0021, Figure 4 A). Similarly, the media with aspartate supplementation showed an increase in the rate of y death after injection with the LSMMG-grown bacteria compared to the control (Ratio 2.26, P  0.007, Figure 4 B). For the LSMMG-grown bacteria, there was a greater rate of y death from the bacteria grown in aspartate and glutamine media compared to the bacteria grown in aspartate alone (Ratio 1.98, P 0.0221, Figure 4 A,B). There is no signi cant difference in mortality rates between the ies injected with bacteria reared in LSMMG with amedia composition composed of just the Davis minimal media (P 0.46) or in the minimal media with just glutamine added (P 0.55, Figure 4 C). The full results of these comparisons can be seen in Table 2 . This in- dicates that while either aspartate alone or both aspartate and glutamine together, can cause an increase in bacterial growth rate in vitro, only the combination of the two amino acids together can cause the LSMMG- specic induction of asnB expression and also causes the maximum in- crease in LSMMG-dependent virulence of the bacteria in terms of mor- tality of the y host (Figures 3and 4). In other words, the increased growth rate in the LSMMG is not a complete determinant for the increased virulence of S. marcescens , but that a change in the metabolism of nutrients like asparagine plays a critical role in the heightened mor- tality induced by gravity-treated bacteria on a host. 3. Discussion In this study, we provide evidence for the importance of nutrient utilization during bacterial growth as a factor for increased host mortality after pathogen growth in LSMMG. Host mortality is a direct measure of Figure 3. Growth and gene expression changes of LSMMG-treated S. marcescens in Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids. Starting concentration of 1 C2 108CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37C14C, containing A) Davis minimal media only, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine, and D) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate. Growth was measured every 24 h for 72 h. E) At the end of growth period, gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR:: L-ap (L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), asnB (asparagine synthetase B), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidaseL-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to the Davis minimal media values and calculated using the Ct method. Even though aspartate addition increases growth in LSMMG cultures but asnB and L-ap genes are overexpressed in LSMMG compared to control only when both glutamine and aspartate are present.R. Gilbert et al. Heliyon 8 (2022) e09379 5pathogen virulence, and therefore an increased rate of host death is one indication of increased virulence of a pathogen  40. While there are studies showing an increase in virulence of pathogens after exposure to space ight and simulated microgravity, the speci c mechanisms that underlie these changes are largely unknown. In our previous study  11, we found that S. marcescens in space ight and in LSMMG show an in- crease in virulence via increased rate of host mortality, and that the in vivogrowth of the pathogen after infection of the host is higher from both space ight and LSMMG treated bacteria. While in vivo growth is only an indirect proxy for virulence, faster pathogen growth immediately following infection is often linked to the ability of the pathogen to overcome host immunity and sustain infection  41,42. Therefore it was necessary for us to examine in more detail the speci c potential mech- anisms for increased virulence of S. marcescens in LSMMG. First we looked at several genes involved in agella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see signicant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control ( Table 3 ). We therefore looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mecha- nisms, and found that genes related to amino acid metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG ( Figure 1 B). We found that several genes within the asparagine synthesis pathway were overexpressed in LSMMG, but specically saw the largest overexpression, an almost 40-fold increase, in the asparagine synthetase B ( asnB gene). Asparagine synthetase B is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine using aspartate, and glutamine as a nitrogen source  43,44. The deletion of the asnB gene leads to a slow-growth phenotype in the pathogen Bacillus subtilis , and in most pathogens (including S. marcescens ) is the main gene involved in asparagine biosynthesis  45. This gene has not been implicated previ- ously in S. marcescens virulence, but has been shown to mediate virulence and resistance to drugs in other bacterial pathogens  36,37. While thisgene and others in amino acid uptake pathways are important for growth and division of the cell, they are also important mediators of host-pathogen interactions  38. While the host utilizes amino acid metabolism to support defense responses against a pathogen, conversely, the pathogen can modulate amino acid metabolism for its own advantage 38. Therefore, amino acid utilization and assimilation mechanisms can be important mediators of infection at the host-pathogen interface, and asparagine metabolism has been linked to virulence and resistance of some pathogens to antibiotics  36,37,38. In this study we characterize the underlying indicators for the increased host mortality that we previously reported after infection with microgravity-treated S. marcescens 11. We show that S. marcescens grown in LSMMG consume key amino acids glutamine and asparagine at a faster rate than the control ( Figure 1 C, D), suggesting that the LSMMG might be priming these pathogens to compete with responding host immune cells for extracellular amino acids necessary for proliferation. In fact, this is the method by which some pathogens are successful colo- nizers of their hosts. The virulence of pathogen Francisella tularensis is dependent on the pathogens ability to replicate inside the host and escape from macrophages  46. Asparagine acquisition is critical in this pathogens success in replicating inside the host cell, where they use the host as a substrate for asparagine and aspartate necessary to replicate 46. Similarly, S. marcescens has been shown to have the ability to sur- vive and proliferate inside non-phagocytic host cells, suggesting that there may be a similar mechanism of host-pathogen competition for amino acids  47. We see in our study that growth in LSMMG increases the expression of asnB (Figure 1 B), implying an increased consumption of aspartate and glutamine to synthesize asparagine more ef ciently, that may allow these pathogens to out-compete host immune cells for amino acids during infection. The presence of both aspartate and glutamine Figure 4. Infection of ies with S. marcescens shows maximum host mortality with LSMMG bacteria when supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine. Sample was grown in A) Davis minimal media (DMM) either alone or with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mMaspartate, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine. Bacteria were grown for 24 h in the RWV, then xed in 20 glycerol for injections into D. melanogaster hosts. Both glutamine and aspartate must be present together to elicit the maximum LSMMG-induced increase in host mortality as shown in Figure 4 A. (The full statistical results for all comparisons can be seen in Table 2 .)R. Gilbert et al. Heliyon 8 (2022) e09379 6causes a signi cant overexpression of asnB, even when they are the only amino acids present in minimal media ( Figure 3 E). This suggests that these two amino acid substrates, which are both required for asparagine synthesis, are important for LSMMG-induced overexpression of asnB. Therefore, we believe that the LSMMG-induced increase in pathogenvirulence may be mediated by the ability of S. marcescens to utilize asparagine more ef ciently within the host after infection, although further studies are needed to evaluate how S. marcescens reared in LSMMG are speci cally interacting with the hosts immune cells. We also found evidence that there is an overexpression of some L- asparaginase subunits, including L-asparaginase ( Figure 3 E and Figure 1 B) when asnB is overexpressed in the presence of its substrates, aspartate and glutamine. The homeostatic maintenance of the asparagine pathway consists of the anabolic and catabolic processes catalyzed by asnB and L-ap respectively which could result in the upregulation of both enzymes with increased asparagine metabolism. In Salmonella typhimu- rium infections, it has been shown that L-asparaginase suppresses T-cell responses by suppressing T-cell blastogenesis, proliferation, and cytokine production in the host, and that this effect could be attenuated by treatment with L-asparagine  48. This highlights the fact that asparagine can be a key amino acid both for mammalian immune responses to bacterial pathogens, and is also important for bacterial growth and virulence properties. In this study, we provide evidence that the aspar- agine pathway is a critical determinant of the LSMMG-dependent in- crease in host mortality induced by S. marcescens . While aspartate alone can increase in vitro growth of S. marcescens in an LSMMG-speci c manner ( Figure 3 D), the combination of both aspartate and glutamine (substrates for asparagine synthesis) are required to cause the maximal increase in host lethality during the infection of D.melanogaster with LSMMG treated bacteria ( Figure 4 A). Similarly, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are required toelicit the full induction of asnB gene expression which is not seen with aspartate or glutamine addition alone ( Figure 3 E). Interestingly, these results indicate that increased division rate of the pathogen during the growth phase alone ( Figure 3 ) is not suf cient to recapitulate the full extent of host mortality observed after infection with microgravity- treated S. marcescens (Figure 4 ). Therefore, the microgravity dependent increase in host mortality induced by S. marcescens , appears to be linked specically with asparagine pathway function under LSMMG conditions, and cannot be fully accounted for simply by increasing bacterial growth rate with the addition of amino acid substrates. To further characterize the effect of the asparagine pathway, the direct suppression of the expression of asnB through controlled genetic mechanisms was not within the scope of this study. However, as mentioned above, we demonstrated that the attenuation of the asparagine pathway, via the absence of relevant amino acids from the growth media, suppresses theoverexpression of asnB in LSMMG ( Figure 3 E) and correlates with increased host survival ( Figure 4 B,C). Additional studies that target asnB gene with a knockdown will be conducted in future. When we co-infect ies with both LSMMG-reared S. marcescens and exogenously-added puri ed L-asparaginase, we see a therapeutic effect, and the ies die at a signi cantly slower rate than the LSMMG-reared bacteria injected alone ( Figure 2 C). This is in line with our hypothesis that growth in LSMMG is priming S. marcescens with the ability to compete effectively with the host for asparagine utilization. The addition of L-asparaginase would break down extracellular asparagine, thereby diminishing the ability of the bacteria to out-compete the hosts ability to utilize asparagine for its cellular processes. Consistent with this, L- asparaginase added to the growth medium causes suppression of S. marcescens growth, but only in LSMMG and not in the RWV-Control (Figure 2 B). These results suggest that additional exogenous L-aspar- aginase has a detrimental effect on the pathogen itself and causes it to become less virulent in LSMMG, perhaps by reducing the amount of available asparagine that otherwise would have enhanced the LSMMG- treated microbes ability to utilize this amino acid in the hosts body. In growth media without the presence of exogenous L-asparaginase, the L-asparagine in the growth media is consumed at a signi cantly faster rate in LSMMG than in the RWV-Control ( Figure 1 C), and a similar effect is seen with the consumption of glutamine ( Figure 1 D). In some pathogens, mutants lacking the ability to synthesize glutamine or to acquireTable 2.

Heliyon 8 (2022) e09379 7glutamine from the host, show attenuated virulence, since this is an important source of nitrogen assimilation during colonization of the pathogen in the host  49,50. These studies further support the idea that amino acids that are critical for several cellular processes, including protein synthesis, can also be important for pathogen virulence. To summarize the results of our study, we report that genes related to asparagine biosynthesis were overexpressed after exposing S. marcescens to LSMMG, and that the consumption rates of extracellular asparagine and glutamine in rich media were higher in LSMMG than in the control (Figure 1 ). In nutrient-limited media, these gene expression and viru- lence patterns can be recapitulated by supplying only the precursors for asparagine biosynthesis: glutamine and aspartate (Figures 3E and 4A). The addition of aspartate causes a LSMMG-speci c increase in growth of S. marcescens but not a concomitant increase in asnB gene expression (Figure 3 D,E). Therefore, LSMMG-speci c increase in expression of the asnB gene is only seen in media that contains both aspartate and gluta- mine, the precursors for asparagine synthesis ( Figure 3 E). Consistent with this, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine in the media during growth is also necessary for the greatest increase in host mortality in LSMMG compared to the control ( Figure 4 A). Furthermore, the coin- jection of exogenous asparaginase during the infection of y hosts with LSMMG-reared S. marcescens, results in a therapeutic effect and the ies die more slowly than with injections of the LSMMG-treated bacteria alone ( Figure 2 C). The results of this study provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the asparagine pathway in increasing S. marcescens effectiveness to kill its host in a microgravity-speci c manner. This study provides a novel mechanism by which microgravity might be affecting S. marcescens virulence via modi ed nutrient utilization capabilities. Importantly, we found that L-asparaginase could be used as a potential therapeutic agent during infections with bacteria in LSMMG. An inter- esting sequelae to this study would be to test the L-asparaginase as a countermeasure where both the host and the pathogen are exposed to microgravity during space ight. This study also furthers our need for understanding how LSMMG may be a unique stressor on bacterial pathogens, and emphasizes the importance of the use of ground-based models in informing space ight research. 3.1. Limitations of the study While this work provides evidence that LSMMG is priming the pathogen to out-compete the host immune system by the ef cient utili- zation of amino acids such as asparagine, we have not yet evaluated the metabolomics of the host-pathogen interface after infection. That data will be collected in a subsequent study as a follow-on to this body of work where we have identi ed a novel mechanistic pathway that correlates Serratia marcescens virulence induced by reduced gravity environments. We were also constrained to using qPCR as the method for analyzing gene expression in this study, although RNA-seq could provide a more global assessment of gene expression changes. However, we have RNA-seq an- alyses ongoing for S. marcescens samples from a recent space ight mission. We anticipate that RNA-seq data will provide additional data to query the LSMMG-treated bacterial samples for additional genetic pathways that may be involved, since both space ight and LSMMG treatment results in increased growth and host mortality induced by S. marcescens . Lastly, while D. melanogaster is an excellent model for characterizing host-pathogen interactions, a future goal would be to conduct complementary studies in mammalian models in preparation for testing countermeasures like asparaginase for future space ight experiments. 3.2. Resource availability The datasets generated during andor analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on request.4. Methods 4.1. D. melanogaster y strains Fly lines were maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle on cornmeal- agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (24C14C). Fly line used in this study was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, w1118(3605). 4.2. Growth of S. marcescens Db11 in rotating wall vessel (RWV) S. marcescens Db11 were taken from stock cultures frozen at -80C14Ci n Copan Cryovials and were grown in sterile 50 mL conical tubes at 37C14Ci n liquid LB media containing 100 gmL streptomycin for 24 h. Liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media and loaded into a sterile 10 mL rotating wall vessel (Synthecon). The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles and simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during space ight  24 and this is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated with an axis of rotation that is perpendic- ular to the orientation of the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedi- mentation induced by Earths gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g), thereby acting as a control for any po- tential biological effects of the container vessel itself  19. Air bubbles were removed from the vessel and vessels were sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either vertical (simulated microgravity) or horizontal (normal gravity, or RWV-Control) orientation at 37C14C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al.  19). Samples were grown for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached. 4.3. Asparagine and glutamine quanti cation At 6 and 14 h of growth, 200 l of sample was taken from the RWV using a sterile 2 mL syringe, and the sample was used per manufacturer protocol to estimate abundances of L-asparagine and L-glutamine. The sample removed from the RWV was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles were removed before resuming rotation. The entire sample removal procedure took less than 5 min. For enzymatic tests, we used the L-AsparagineL-GlutamineAmmonia Assay Kit (Megazyme) following the manufacturers recommendations and using asparagine or glutamine (nal concentration 0.6 mM) as substrates. Enzymatic activities were measured by following the disappearance of the NADPH from the buffer along time as an indirect indication of asparagine deamination at 340 nm using a microplate reader (VERSAmax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Experiments were performed in three independent replicates. 4.4. Growth of S. marcescens with L-asparaginase Stocks of Db11 were prepared for growth in RWV as described above in either vertical (simulated microgravity with axis of rotation being perpendicular to the gravity vector) or horizontal (normal gravity RWV- control orientation with the axis of rotation being parallel to the gravity vector) orientations at 37C14C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al. 19). One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase (Millipore Sigma) suspended in sterile water was added to the growth media for half of the vessels, and the other half received only 100 l of the sterile water. Growth of the bacteria was estimated by absorbance at 600 nm and was measured every 3 h. Samples were grown for 24 h total to ensure that stationary phase was reached. The sample removed from the RWV for quanti cation was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles wereR. Gilbert et al. Heliyon 8 (2022) e09379 8removed before resuming rotation. These experiments were run in three independent replicates. 4.5. L-asparaginase treatment S. marcescens in the stationary phase were preserved at -80C14Ci n1 0 mL of 20 glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts of Serratia in different con- centrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteriawas plated as a negative control for contamination. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 C210 5CFUmL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scienti c) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory  11. Concentrations were adjusted so that each in- jection was approximately 10 CFU y. A total of 180 ies were injected, with 60 total ies assigned to each bacterial treatment group. Control bacteria, simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, or a glycerol sham were then injected into the 30 anesthetized 2-3 day-old males and 30 females (post-eclosion) D. melanogaster in the ventral abdomen near the seventheighth segment. One hour later, half of those ies (15 per sex) were injected with 32 nL L-asparaginase. After injections, ies were kept at 25C14C on the same standard dextrose food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for at least 24 h. These experi- ments were repeated in three independent replicates. 4.6. Growth in Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids Bacteria were prepared using the protocol previously mentioned, but Davis Minimal Media supplemented with 10 mM of aspartate, glutamine, or a 5050 mixture of aspartate and glutamine was used in place of LB broth. To quantify growth, 20 l of sample diluted in 180 l of PBS was read at an absorbance of A600 every 24 h for 72 h. To keep the volume of the RWV consistent, 20 l of sterile PBS was placed in each vessel to make up for the volume lost during sampling. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. S. marcescens in the stationary phase were preserved at -80C14C in 10 mL of 20 glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts of Serratia in different concentrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteria were plated as a negative control for contami- nation. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 C2 105CFUmL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scienti c) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory  11. Concentrations were adjusted so that each in- jection was approximately 10 CFU y. A total of 30 ies (15 males and 15 females) were infected with each experimental sample, including 30 total ies injected with a glycerol sham. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. 4.7. Expression analysis of amino acid genes Samples were diluted to 1 C2108cells and pelleted, and RNA was extracted from pelleted samples using the RNEasyMini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scienti c). Relative gene expression levels were quanti ed using the 7500 Real Time PCR instrument from Applied Biosystems and SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed with Primer-Blast, NCBI. Real-time cycler conditions were; 95 C14C for 15 min for initial activation step, and 40 cycles of 94C14C for 15 s, 50 C14C for 30 s, and 72C14C for 30 s for denaturation, annealing, and extension respectively. Data were normalized to the reference gene recA. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates, including RNA extraction from three independent growth trials and three qPCR runs of each sample (9 total plates). Additionally, each plate (replicate) contained 6 identical wells which were averaged to give a mean C Tvalueof a given gene, ensuring that any pipetting errors were minimized in the data. 4.8. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and JMP Pro 15 (SAS). Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and Excel (version 15.4). For survival analyses, a Cox Proportional Hazards modelwas used. The Cox Proportional Hazards model allows for the compari- son of survival between all groups when there are multiple risk factors or treatments involved. The proportional hazards test generates a risk ratio  when comparing treatment curves, which can be interpreted in infection experiments as a rate of death. For example, a risk ratio of 2.0 means that one treatment kills the host twice as fast as the treatment its being compared to. For all growth measurements, a one-way ANOVA was used in combination with a Tukey-Kramer posthoc analysis. For gene expression, expression values are reported as fold change relative to the Davis minimal media values, which were calculated in Excel using the C tmethod. For all statistical analyses, only results with a statistical signicance0.05 are reported, due to the magnitude of results tables.

        "introduction": "Human pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by space ight. Under- standing the effects that space ight may have on the adaptation and tness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treat- ment and prevention options is limited. This is even more important in the context of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which typically produce benign infections, until they are challenged by certain environmental conditions or when host immune impairments occur, which can then equip them with the ability to cause serious health concerns  1. One such environmental condition is space ight, which has beendemonstrated to convert opportunistic pathogens to primary pathogens, enabling them to take advantage of a compromised immune system that may occur to astronauts during space ight  2,3. In line with this, there is mounting evidence that primary bacterial pathogens often undergo a diversity of signi cant phenotypic shifts during space ight, including increased antibiotic resistance  4,5,6,7, increased virulence  8,9,10, 11, and morphological changes associated with pathogenicity  12. Despite mounting research in these primary pathogens, much less is known about phenotypic shifts that occur to opportunistic pathogens when exposed to microgravity. Speci cally, there is little known about how pathogens may be utilizing nutrients differently in the microgravity environment of space compared to ground microbes, and potentially how  Corresponding author.

Due to increased nosocomial reports, the human opportunistic bac- teria, Serratia marcescens, has emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance  13,14.S. marcescens is a ubiquitous pathogen that occupies a wide variety of habitats and hosts. It can adapt quickly to antibiotics independently and simultaneously, which is likely due to the loss of conserved genetic elements and large genomic diversity among strains  14,15,16. Furthermore, S. marcescens was found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station  17,18. Therefore, this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for space ight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts that are more suscep- tible to opportunistic pathogens and especially considering the compli- cations with antibiotic resistance  2,18. Research in our laboratory has demonstrated that there is a signi - cant shift in virulence with S. marcescens (Db11) after space ight. When cultured aboard the International Space Station, S. marcescens Db11 kil- led healthy ground-reared Drosophila melanogaster hosts signi cantly faster than an identical control of the bacteria that was cultured on the ground  11. However, the speci c mechanisms of increased Db11 virulence and reduced D. melanogaster survival are currently unknown. In line with this, increased virulence is observed with various space and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)-isolated bacteria, including studies with Salmonella 19, and Staphylococcus aureus 20, which pose a threat to astronaut health during space ight. Our prior research has shown that Serratia marcescens also shows a signi cant increase in host lethality of D. melanogaster after growth in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions  11. Since space ight studies are costly and can be dif cult to perform due to constraints on experimental design and the availability of space ight opportunities, many researchers perform ground-based studies using devices such as the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity21,22,23. The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles, thereby creating a low uid shear environment that simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during space ight  24 and is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated such that the axis of rotation is perpen- dicular to the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental ef- fects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earths gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g) without continuous suspension while acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the vessel itself. Although this method is not an exact recreation of the space ight environment, the effects of the LSMMG environment have been demonstrated to recapitulate nd- ings from space ight studies  10,11. Drosophila melanogaster , as used in this study, has proven to be a useful host model for space ight and ground-based studies in the past. This is due to their well-characterized innate immune system, tractable genetics, ease of use, short life-cycle, genetic homology to mammalian systems, and low resource requirements for breeding large colonies  11, 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. In the current study, we use LSMMG to investigate the speci c mechanisms that enable microgravity-treated Serratia marcescens bacte- ria to kill the host D. melanogaster more quickly than control bacterial cultures. A screen of several genes related to known S. marcescens viru- lence factors did not reveal any differences of expression in LSMMGcompared to RWV-Control. Further testing revealed a LSMMG-dependent overexpression of the gene asparagine synthetase B ( asnB), which is implicated in virulence and resistance to drugs in other pathogenic bacteria  36,37. This gene is involved with amino acid metabolism and has been linked to both pathogen growth and virulence  38. Aminoacids like asparagine are thought to be important to the competition between hosts and pathogens in determining the outcome of an infection 38. Since our previous study indicated that the LSMMG-reared S. marcescens killed the host faster after infection  11 than control S. marcescens cultures, we wanted to explore whether the asparagine pathway might be linked to the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG treatment. Here, we show that LSMMG treatment causes a change in the expression of key asparagine pathway related genes in S. marcescens with a concomitant increase in host mortality. Further, we nd that these changes in key asparagine pathway genes and increased host mortality can be recapitulated in an LSMMG-speci c manner by the addition of aspartate and glutamine (the substrates of asparagine synthesis) to minimal media. We also show that the addition of L-asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine, can mitigate the LSMMG-induced increase in host virulence. Thus, this study allows us to understand the phenotypic shifts occurring in microbes exposed to altered gravity, and more speci cally, how amino acid metabolism may affect the mortality rate of the host. In addition, these results will allow us to explore the asparagine pathway further and develop countermeasures that target amino acid biosynthesis in opportunistic pathogens such as S. marcescens, as an essential consid- eration to maintain host health during space ight. 2.",
