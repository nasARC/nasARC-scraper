One aspect of spaceflight, micro  gravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregula tion of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gramnegative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity condi tions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes. Results: Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affili ated with extrinsicreceptor mediated and intrinsicstressinduced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using cas pase inhibitors. Conclusions: The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.

A reduction in Earths gravity can significantly change the shear forces, buoyancy-driven convection, and hydrostatic pressures that organisms experience 1 , thus altering critical biological pathways at the cellular, subcellular, and molecular level 2 . One such pathway that can be negatively impacted during spaceflight and microgravity analogs conditions is apoptosis or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process that eliminates damaged and unnecessary cells without inflammation and constitutes a critical lever of physiological homeostasis in multi - cellular organisms 3 . Anomalies in programmed cell death have been attributed to some of the most debili - tating health effects of spaceflight, including muscular Open Access Correspondence: jfosterufl.edu Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, Space Life Science Lab, University of Florida, Merritt Island, FL 32953, USAPage 2 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 atrophy, bone demineralization, immune system dys - regulation, cardiovascular deconditioning, and visual impairment 4 , 5. Additionally, rodent studies con - ducted with the hindlimb unloading model, which mimics the reduced weight-bearing of spaceflight through a 30 head-down tilt, have reported higher rates of myonuclear and osteocytic apoptosis during muscular atrophy and bone loss 6 , 7. Other studies have shown that exposure to actual or simulated micro - gravity conditions can induce apoptosis in the leuko - cytes of humans and mice, with effects lingering for up to a week post-flight 8 , 9. Endothelial cells (e.g., coro - nary arteries) also exhibit increased mortality under microgravity conditions 10, which may contribute to cardiovascular deterioration in flight. Collectively, these findings indicate a more intricate understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microgravity- induced apoptosis in animals is needed to ensure the continued health and wellbeing of crew members dur - ing long-term space missions. Indeed, dysbiosis is a well-known consequence of spaceflight and there is compelling evidence to suggest that disruptions in an animals normal, healthy, microbi - ome may be related to dysfunctional apoptotic cell death in microgravity 11, 12. Altered proportions of Firmi - cutes and Bacteroidetes in the gastrointestinal tract of mice have been associated with reduced apoptosis among colonic epithelial cells in modeled microgravity, thus hin - dering tissue turnover 13. Simulated weightlessness has also been shown to induce apoptotic damage in the intes - tinal mucosal barrier of rats, which is paralleled by com - positional changes in the gut microbiome 14. To address these issues, the monospecific mutualism between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scol - opes, and the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio fischeri has emerged as a tractable model system to study the impact of reduced gravity on bacteria-induced changes to host physiology, including apoptosis 15, 16. V. fischeri colonizes a specialized light organ (Fig. 1a-c) in the host squid and produces luminescence that the squid uses at night to conceal its shadow from predators 17. Shortly after E. scolopes hatch, V. fischeri are entrained from the surrounding seawater via ciliated epithelial append - ages (CEA) that border each lobe of the nascent light organ (Fig. 1b), and in so doing, potentiate colonization. Shortly thereafter, microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tracheal cytotoxin, induce a post-embryonic remod - eling event during which apoptosis is widely induced throughout the light organs ciliated fields (Fig. 1c), peak - ing at 16 h 1820. Subsequently, in the days following colonization, these structures completely regress 21 and the light organ undergoes further maturation 22.To simulate microgravity, high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) have been successfully used with the squid- vibrio symbiosis to generate a low sheared modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment (Fig. 1c)  15, 16, 23, 24. Briefly, rotation about a horizontal axis offsets gravi - tational settling such that the contents of each reactor are maintained in a state of constant suspension under low shear conditions that emulate the quiescent fluid dynam - ics of low Earth orbit (Fig. 1c). Rotation about a verti - cal axis, by contrast, allows for sedimentation to occur unperturbed and thus serves as the unit Earth gravity controls (Fig. 1c)  25. The LSMMG environment pro - duced by this ground-based analog has been used for decades to model microgravity, and results obtained with the HARVs have been shown to parallel the findings of many spaceflight studies 25, 26. Previously, studies using the squid-vibrio model in LSMMG revealed that the bacteria-induced development of the light organ is accelerated under modeled micro - gravity conditions (Fig. 1d) 15, however, the mecha - nisms by which these changes occur are unknown. In this study, we characterize several aspects of the apoptosis genetic machinery in the host squid, examine the dif - ferential expression of several of these apoptosis-related genes, and assess the activity and mitigation potential of several initiator and executioner caspases associated with apoptosis under modeled microgravity conditions. The outcomes provide new insight into the mecha - nisms underlying apoptotic dysregulation in response to microgravity-like stress and its potential impact on the physiology of animals and beneficial microbes during spaceflight. Results Identification of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis network within the host Euprymna scolopes To elucidate the apoptosis machinery in the bobtail squid, a detailed map of the putative pathways for apop - tosis in the squid host was generated by data-mining the reference transcriptome and genome of E. scolopes (Fig. 2). This search identified 293 transcripts, represent - ing 137 unique genes, involved in the regulation of apop - tosis in the host squid (Table S1; Fig. S1). The resultant network revealed an elaborate web of parallel and hier - archical interactions and pro-and anti-apoptotic effectors that appear to govern extrinsic, receptor-mediated, and intrinsic, stress-induced cell death via transcriptional, translational, and post-translational means (Fig. 2). For the extrinsic apoptosis network, two tumor necro - sis factor receptor superfamily members (Tnfrsf11, Tnfrsf21) and five Tnf-associated factors (Traf 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) were discovered in E. scolopes (Fig. 2, Table S1). The closely related initiator caspases-8 and -10 were also Page 3 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 identified, as well as death domain-associated adaptors Fadd, Daxx, and the stress-associated kinase Ripk1. Inter - estingly, neither Fas ligand nor its corresponding recep - tor was found in the reference transcriptome despite the presence of components known to operate downstream (e.g., Fadd). Nevertheless, E. scolopes was determined to harbor all the effectors required to assemble a complete death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) for extrin - sic, receptor-mediated apoptosis, which serves as the activation assembly for extrinsic initiator caspases-10 and -8 27. Additionally, transcripts associated with three LPS-binding proteins (Lbps) and the LPS-induced transcription factor, Litaf, which have been previously described in E. scolopes 28 were also observed in the putative extrinsic, receptor-mediated network (Fig. 2). With regards to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, tran - scripts encoding both pro-apoptotic (Bnip3, Bcl10, Bcl2L13, Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl2L1, Mcl1, Fig. 1 Overview of the host Euprymna scolopes, experimental setup, and developmental timeline under different gravitational treatments. a Image of E. scolopes paralarvae at the time of hatching.

BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 Ar1) members of the Bcl2 protein family were found in E. scolopes (Fig. 2; Table S1). A variety of mitochondrial pro - teins (i.e., Aifm1, Aifm3, Diablo, Cytc, Htra2) were identi - fied as well as Apaf1 and the intrinsic initiator caspase-9. Thus, all the requisite parts of the apoptosome, which is the activation complex of the stress-induced pathway for cell death were found in the bobtail squid (Fig. 2). How - ever, the Bh3-only protein Bid, which typically represents a critical junction for crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways for apoptosis in animals, was conspic - uously absent. Likewise, the presence of atypical initiator caspase-2 was confirmed along with Pidd1, both of which are constituents of the pro-death, p53-inducible, PIDDo - some complex that forms in response to DNA damage 29; however, no evidence of the third member of this assembly, RaiddCradd, was found in the bobtail squid reference transcriptome or genome. In addition to Bcl2-type repressors, transcripts encoding numerous inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (Iaps) were discovered in the host squid. Included among these were Xiap, Diap2, three Baculoviral Iap- repeat containing proteins (Birc7b, Birc3, and Birc6), three Bcl2-associated athanogene regulators (Bag 1, 4, and 6), cell death regulator Aven, the peptidyl isomer - ase Pin1, as well as heat shock proteins Hsp90 and Hsp7c (Table S1 ). Further examination revealed the presence of numerous cathepsin (B, K, L, L1, L2, Z) and calpain (13, 5, 79, 11, B, D) proteases, several of which have been previously reported in E. scolopes 30. The cathepsins recovered from the reference tran - scriptome were primarily cysteine-dependent, except for cathepsin B, which is a serine protease. Intriguingly, neither aspartic acid-type cathepsins (D and E) were found in the host squid. Analysis of the E. scolopes reference transcriptome revealed a variety of nucleus-localizing proteins affili - ated with apoptosis (Table S1). Broadly, this included transcription factors (i.e., Aatf, Atf4, Jun, E2f, Hox, Irf, Litaf, NF-B, p73), p53-type transactivators (i.e., Aspp1, Ccar1), and apoptotic mediators of chromatin conden - sation and DNA fragmentation (i.e., Acin1, DffbCad, EndoG) (Table S1). Transcripts encoding numerous reg - ulators of apoptotic translation were likewise present in the squid, most notably the eukaryotic initiation factors Eif2, Eif3f, Eif3j, Eif4b, and Eif4e (Table S1). Interestingly, however, no transactivating factors of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation were present in the transcriptome of E. scolopes, and the nuclear lamin protease and executioner caspase, caspase-6, was not observed.

BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 the symbiotic bacterium V. fischeri ES114. Overall, the NanoString results indicated that there was an increase in the transcription of genes associated with both receptor- mediated and stress-induced apoptosis under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3, 4). With regards to effectors of extrinsic, receptor-medi - ated, apoptosis, the LPS binding proteins 1 and 3, along with the endotoxin-induced transcription factor Litaf were significantly up-expressed in modeled micrograv - ity between 6 and 10 h post-hatching (Fig. 3). Likewise, transcripts encoding the adaptor protein Fadd were more abundant during the early hours of development in LSMMG; however, these results were not statistically sig - nificant from the gravity controls (Fig. 3). A similar trend was observed in the NanoString results for genes affiliated with intrinsic, stress-induced apop - tosis. The Bh3-only protein Bnip3, membrane permea - bilizer Bak, Diablo, and caspase-dependent Aifm3 were significantly up expressed in LSMMG between 8 and 12 h compared to gravity controls (Fig. 3). Bnip3, which overcomes Bcl-2 type suppression of pro-death effec - tors BaxBak, increased overtime under LSMMG peak - ing at 16 and 18 h in LSMMG compared to the unit gravity controls (Fig. 3). Bnip3 is known to be induced under hypoxic conditions, however, measurements of the dissolved oxygen content were consistent across all treatments at 24 h revealing no difference in oxygen availability in the HARVs (Fig. S2). Expression of prodeath caspases in host animal under LSMMG conditions The identification of caspase-2, -3, -7, -8, -9, and -10 transcripts in the reference transcriptome suggested the presence of canonical pathways for extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in E. scolopes (Fig. 4). Additionally, caspase-driven apoptosis has a known role in the bacte - ria-induced development of the light organ, given that treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK has been shown to reduce the number of dying cells observed at 24 h post-inoculation 30. These results suggested that caspase regulation, either at the level of mRNA andor protein, was a contributing factor to the accelerated developmental timeline of apoptosis in the host light organ under LSMMG conditions (Fig. 1d). NanoString analysis was used to examine the differen - tial gene expression of the putative initiator (i.e., casp2 , casp8 , casp9 , and casp10) and executioner (i.e., casp3 ) caspase genes in symbiotic and aposymbiotic squid under Fig. 3 Extrinsic and intrinsic gene expression in symbiotic hatchlings in gravity controls relative to LSMMG.

Results revealed that under LSMMG conditions there was a pronounced increase in the pro-death caspase transcripts between 6 and 10 h post-colonization by V. fischeri (Fig. 4), which aligns with early-onset apoptosis previously observed in paralarvae squid exposed to modeled microgravity 15. Aposymbiotic control animals that were not exposed to V. fischeri showed no differential expression under LSMMG or gravity conditions at these same time points (Fig. S3). The architecture of caspase domain structure in Euprymna scolopes To evaluate the extent of similarity between the E. scolopes caspase (EsCasp) enzymes and homologs in other animals, the domain architecture of EsCasps was mapped and compared to sequences derived from Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, and Xen - opus laevis (Fig. 5). Additionally, the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and the East Asian octopus, Octopus sinensis, were included in the analysis to distinguish lineage-specific modifications within the Mollusca phylum andor among cephalopods (Fig. 5, Additional File 3 ). Domain analysis via SMART, Inter - ProScan, and the NCBI Conserved Domain Database, as described in the Methods, revealed that the archi - tecture of caspases-2, -3, -7, -8, and -9 in E. scolopes is largely consistent with that of other animals, including both vertebrates and invertebrates alike (Fig. 5). Typi - cally, the EsCasps ranged from 327 to 634 residues in length and weighed between 41.4 and 72.1 kDa (Table 2). The main exception to this was EsCasp10_2X, which was only 297 amino acids long and had a molec - ular weight of 34.4 kDa (Table 2 ). Several EsCasps exhibited key structural elements characteristic of caspases in other animals (Fig. 5). For example, the extrinsic initiator caspase-8 of E. scolopes (EsCasp8) exhibited dual twin death effector domains (DED) at the N-terminus, which is characteristic of both vertebrates and invertebrate caspase-8 proteins; how - ever, this dual DED domain was missing in the initiator EsCasp10 isoforms when compared to vertebrates H. sapiens, D. rerio, and X. laevis (Fig. 5). EsCasp10 did har - bor a singular caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), suggesting a potential misannotation. The CARD domain was also observed in EsCasp2 and -9 initiator caspases, which is typical of most verte - brates and invertebrates (Fig. 5). Interestingly, caspase-9 in M. galloprovincialis (MgCasp9) exhibited dual DED in place of the traditional CARD, suggesting a potential misannotation of this protein in M. galloprovincialis. In all sequences examined, a carboxyl-terminal catalytic (CASc) domain was present (Fig. 5, yellow box). The CASc is a 45 kDa precursor that is cleaved during acti - vation to yield the p20 and p10 subunits. Intriguingly, despite the presence of a complete CASc, analysis of Fig. 4 Apoptotic caspase expression in symbiotic hatchlings under gravity and low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) conditions.

BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 EsCasp2_2x and EsCasp9 revealed the smaller p10 subu - nit was not detected in these two isoforms. Executioner caspases-3 and -7 in animals typically lack pro-domains and are therefore shorter as a result (Fig. 5). The executioner caspases of E. scolopes (EsCasp3 and -7) varied from 213 to 370 residues in length and had a molecular weight ranging from 23.9 to 41.5 kDa (Table 2; Table S2), thus were comparable to both the vertebrate and invertebrate species targeted in this analysis. Most EsCasp3 and -7 isoforms exhibited a conserved QACRG pentapeptide in the catalytic region or equivalent (Table 2). Phylogenetic analysis of host squid caspases Maximum likelihood analysis of the initiator caspases revealed two distinctive clusters primarily consisting of caspases-8, -9 and -10, and caspase-2, respectively (Fig. 6a), that were reflective of the function of whether Fig. 5 Protein sequence based analysis of modular domain architecture for the initiator and executioner caspases of E. scolopes, H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, X. laevis, M. galloprovincialis, and O. sinensis. The X axis indicates residue position in the primary peptide sequence. Red boxes represent death effector domains (DED) whereas green boxes are caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD). The 45 kDa CASc precursor is illustrated by a yellow box, with the resulting p20 and p10 subunits shaded medium and dark blue, respectively. Variants of squid caspase enzymes are indicated by the notation nX where n is the isoform numberPage 9 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 the initiator caspases were activated by extrinsic or intrinsic triggers. EsCasp8 clustered with all other cas - pase-8 proteases sourced from NCBI but was closest to proteases from O. sinensis. Similarly, EsCasp2 also branched closely with both invertebrate and vertebrate caspase-2 initiators. Unexpectedly, EsCasp9 clustered with the two sequences that were likely misannotated as isoforms of caspase-10. Although the monophyly of the group is indeterminate due to the low outer branch support value (42), these sequences share several distinguishing fea - tures that suggest they may represent a group of caspase- 9-like initiators that is specific to Euprymna (Fig. 6a). First, the domain organization of EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X emulates that of canonical caspases -2 and -9, with an N-terminal CARD domain and a C-termi - nal CASc region (Fig. 5). Second, although the sequences of this group exhibit 94 to 95 identity with one another, their percent identity scores with the other initiator cas - pases are very low, between 15 and 29, which indicates they may have distinct structural features (Fig. S4). Third, EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X all exhibit a conserved QACQP catalytic pentapeptide (Table 2). Caspases, uniformly, possess a QACXG motif in the active site, with the middle position specifying the cata - lytic cysteine residue 31. Given its crucial importance to the protease activity of caspases, variations within this pentapeptide are limited and may denote similar functions. The maximum likelihood estimation of executioner caspases formed two several distinctive groups primar - ily separated into vertebrate and invertebrate clusters (Fig. 6b). For example, the vertebrate caspases-7 and -3 from H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio, and X. laevis formed distinctive groupings, that excluded most of the molluscan isoforms. Interestingly, two caspase-7 iso - forms from E. scolopes (EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X) had a higher association with the vertebrate executioner caspases than the other molluscan orthologs for cas - pase-3 and -7 (Fig. 6b). This phylogeny may allude to a greater degree of differentiation, or perhaps expansion, among the executioner caspases of the squid, which has previously been documented in bivalves 32, 33. How - ever, the percent identity among the executioners was 47 which makes it difficult to discern whether these sequences represent isoforms of the same gene(s) or an expansion of caspases-3 and -7 in E. scolopes (Fig. S4). Overall, there appeared to be a relatively high degree of similarity among the executioner caspases of E. scol - opes. However, the close affiliation of EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X with vertebral orthologs suggests the pres - ence of at least two distinct executioner-type caspases in the squid. Unsurprisingly, both the initiator and execu - tioner caspases of E. scolopes were most closely related to O. sinensis, and to a lesser extent, M. galloprovincialis, which is consistent with their categorization as both soft- bodied cephalopods and, more broadly, mollusks. Caspase activity and mitigation during the onset of symbiosis and light organ morphogenesis under LSMMG and gravity conditions The activities of executioner caspases-37, extrinsic initiator caspase-8, and intrinsic initiator caspase-9 were quantified in host animals in the presence and absence of the symbiont V. fischeri using Caspase Glo activity kits. Note, due to the similar mechanisms of activity, the kits could not resolve between cas - pase-3 and caspase-7 activities. All caspases tested were significantly more active in symbiotic animals at 16 h post-colonization, the peak of cell death 19, Table 2 Initiator and executioner caspases in Euprymna scolopes Name Type Catalytic pentapeptideMolecular weight (kDa)Length pI BLASTx Escore topBLASTx Organism EsCasp10_1X Initiator QACQP 72.1 634 5.83 9.28e 16 Caspase 10 Homo sapiens EsCasp10_2X Initiator QACQP 34.4 297 4.69 7.95e 17 Caspase 10 Homo sapiens EsCasp8 Initiator QACQG 63.1 560 7.76 2.78e 57 Caspase 8 Rattus norvegicus EsCasp2_1X Initiator QANSV 67.7 591 5.28 3.58e 08 Caspase 2 Mus musculus EsCasp2_2X Initiator QACRS 41.4 368 5.67 4e25 Caspase 2 Mus musculus EsCasp9 Initiator QACQP 46.8 481 4.77 3.44e 13 Caspase 9 Homo sapiens EsCasp7_1X Executioner QSCRG 38.4 337 8.62 89e58 Caspase 7 Mesocricetus auratus EsCasp7_2X Executioner QACRG 41.5 370 5.13 6.09e 70 Caspase 7 Homo sapiens EsCasp7_3X Executioner QACRG 33.9 296 6.71 1.39e 71 Caspase 7 Mus musculus EsCasp7_4X Executioner QACRG 23.9 213 4.75 7.03e 56 Caspase 7 Mus musculus EsCasp3_1X Executioner QACRG 35.3 313 6.97 2.63e 65 Caspase 3 Bos taurus EsCasp3_2X Executioner QACRG 41.2 365 6.8 4.52e 72 Caspase 3 Mus musculusPage 10 of 20 Vroom et al.

In all three treatments, there was a 26-fold increase in executioner caspase activity (Fig. 7a) compared to the extrinsic and intrin - sic initiators (Fig. 7 b, c).To test whether the caspases could be inhibited in the host animals, pre-treatment with inhibitors targeting dif - ferent caspases was used.

BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 for two hours prior to the start of the symbiosis signifi - cantly reduced apoptotic cell levels at 16 h in symbiotic hatchlings compared to untreated symbiotic controls but did not completely inhibit apoptosis (Fig. 7d). Inter - estingly, although the Caspase-Glo assays indicated cas - pase-9 was active during the apex of cell death (Fig. 7c), treatment with the caspase-9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK did not reduce the level of pycnotic nuclei observed at 16 h relative to the untreated or DMSO-treated controls (Fig. d). Additionally, the coupling of different inhibitors showed no additive effects (Fig. 7d). The colonization of the host squid did not appear to be affected as symbiotic animals exhibited normal luminescence levels through - out the experimental treatments. To elucidate the effects of LSMMG stress on caspase activity, 10 h symbiotic animals were examined with Caspase Glo activity kits (Fig. 8). This time point was chosen as it coincided with the higher expression of cas - pase transcripts in LSMMG (Fig. 4). Results indicated that LSMMG-treated animals exhibited higher levels of Fig. 8 Caspase activity and protease inhibition during light organ apoptosis in gravity and LSMMG conditions at 10 h post inoculation. The activity of a executioner caspases 37, b extrinsic initiator caspase 8, and c intrinsic initiator caspase 9 was measured in the light organ of symbiotic (sym) hatchlings at 10 h in gravity (blue) and modeled microgravity (red). d Apoptosis was quantified in symbiotic hatchlings at 10 h in both conditions following protease inhibitor treatment including pan caspase inhibitor z VAD FMK (ZVAD), the caspase 8 inhibitor AcIETD CHO (C8i), caspase 9 inhibitor AcLEHD CMK (C9i), Pefabloc (Pefa) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls.

BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 caspase-37 and caspase-8 activity compared to grav - ity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. 8a, b). Interest - ingly, no differences were observed in caspase-9 activity in symbiotic animals incubated under LSMMG or gravity conditions, (Fig. 8c). Executioner activity was observed to be several orders of magnitude higher than both initiator caspases, exhibiting up to a 32-fold increase compared to the initiator caspases in both aposymbiotic and sym - biotic animals (Fig. 8a-c). Treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc abrogated the significant increase in light organ apop - tosis observed at 10 h in LSMMG in symbiotic animals (Fig. 8d). Discussion As humans prepare for space exploration beyond low Earth orbit, it will be critical to fully understand the impact that spaceflight has on mutualistic animal- microbe interactions. Maintaining a healthy microbi - ome during long-duration spaceflights will require a comprehensive assessment of the effects that environ - mental stresses, such as microgravity, have on the bac - teria-induced development of host tissues 12, 34. To address this key issue in space biology, we examined the effects of simulated microgravity on the beneficial asso - ciation between Euprymna scolopes and Vibrio fischeri, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of bacteria- induced apoptosis in the light organ of the squid host. The outcomes of this study indicated that (i) E. scolopes harbors a rich network of genes involved in both extrin - sic and intrinsic apoptotic regulation; (ii) the presence of symbiotic bacteria and LSMMG-stress altered the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression; (iii) the normal, bacteria-induced apoptosis in the squid light organ is mediated in part by caspases that exhibit increased activity under LSMMG; and (iv) the LSMMG-associated increase of caspase activity can be pharmacologically mitigated with inhibitors. Apoptosis is a critical pathway for animal development playing key roles in tissue homeostasis, antimicrobial defense as well as innate and adaptive immune responses 35, 36. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to discern the effects of the microbiome on apoptosis 37, 38 and how this vital form of physiological cell death is altered by microgravity 13, 39. Although E. scolopes has served as a model organism for decades, the path - ways by which the symbiont V. fischeri induces apoptotic cell death have not been fully delineated with only a few effectors identified 28, 4042. The recent sequencing of the E. scolopes genome and reference transcriptome has enabled critical animal pathways, including apoptosis, to be investigated 43.Analyses revealed that E. scolopes harbors genes associ - ated with both primary pathways for cell death that are typically seen in animals, including death-receptor medi - ated extrinsic pathways as well as intracellular stress- induced intrinsic pathways (Fig. 2; Fig. S1; Additional File 1). Results also suggest that E. scolopes may form distinct caspase activation platforms, particularly regarding the extrinsic, receptor-mediated, pathway. For example, the absence of Cradd in E. scolopes, as well as in the octopus genome, suggests that cephalopod caspase-2 exerts its pro-apoptotic effects outside the PIDDosome complex, likely in association with Tnf receptor signaling 44, 45. Intriguingly, for 15 apoptosis candidates in the refer - ence transcriptome of E. scolopes, no proteins of signifi - cant similarity were found in the SwissProt database via BLASTx or BLASTp (Additional File 1). These queries were initially identified based on possessing a CARD- or DED-domain and preliminary BLASTp analysis using non-redundant NCBI database returned mostly unchar - acterized and predicted caspase-interacting protein in other cephalopods. Accordingly, these unknown candi - dates may represent novel apoptotic effectors within the Mollusca phylum. In general, cephalopods appear to possess a more expansive vertebrate-like repertoire of intrinsic apop - tosis genes than other mollusks, including Bnip3, Bax, Apaf1, Htra2, and Pidd 32, 46, 47. These results suggest that apoptosis has undergone substantial lineage-specific modifications within the Mollusca phylum, which may have resulted in distinct mechanisms of induction. For example, caspase-9 proteins have been described in the mussel M. galloprovincialis despite the lack of Apaf1, which is a critical component of the apoptosome com - plex in other animals 33, 47. Under the stress of LSMMG conditions, however, there was an acceleration and increased expression of the transcripts associated with bacteria-induced apoptosis genes in symbiotic animals, specifically related to extrin - sic, receptor-mediated cell death (Fig. 3). The increased transcriptional response in symbiotic animals was pri - marily observed among PRR elements for LPS, including LPS-binding proteins Lbp1 and Lbp3, as well as the LPS- induced transcription factor Litaf (Fig. 3). Elevated con - centrations of Lbps have been observed in blood plasma of astronauts returning from shuttle missions, as well as the sera of mice following two days of hindlimb suspen - sion 48, 49. In E. scolopes, however, previous work has demon - strated that Lbps1 exhibits a symbiosis-specific function and contributes to bacteria-induced apoptosis in the light organ of E. scolopes 28. Little is known about the functions of Lbp2 and Lbp3 in E. scolopes and the pre - cise mechanisms by which symbiotic paralarvae identify Page 14 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 LPS remain unclear 50. However, mammalian Lbps facilitate the receptor-based recognition of gram-nega - tive endotoxin 28, which raises the possibility that the Lbps of E. scolopes may be responsible for the delivery of symbiont LPS to death receptors on target host cells, thereby promoting extrinsic apoptosis throughout the ciliated epithelium of the light organ. Additionally, pre - vious studies have shown that LSMMG can increase the shedding of reactogenic LPS by V. fischeri 16, thus the combined increase in available MAMP shedding coupled with the increased expression of Lbp1 and Lbp3 recep - tors in LSMMG may facilitate the accelerated extrinsic apoptosis response in the symbiotic animals under mod - eled microgravity conditions. In symbiotic hatchlings, the expression of genes asso - ciated with intrinsic, stress-induced, cell death was also increased under LSMMG conditions, specifically within the window of 10 to 12 h post-bacterial colo - nization (Fig. 3). This increase included the Bh3-only protein Bnip3, the membrane permeabilizer Bak, as well as the mitochondrial proteins Diablo and Aifm3 (Fig. 3). Previous studies with space shuttle-flown murine embryonic stem cells have also shown a similar up-regulation of intrinsic apoptosis-associated genes, including Bnip3 51. Bh3-only proteins are the sentinels of stress-induced apoptosis and form the molecular basis of crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Bnip3 expression is known to be induced by hypoxia-depend - ent signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS), both of which are elements of oxidative stress 52, 53. Although no evidence of hypoxia was observed in the HARVs dur - ing the experimental conditions (Fig. S2), reactive oxygen and nitric oxide stress are critical components during the onset of the squid-vibrio symbiosis 54, 55. Indeed, the phenomenon of spaceflight and microgravity-induced oxidative stress has been extensively documented in astronauts and many other model organisms and cell lines 23, 56, 57. Consequently, the up expression of Bnip3, Bak, Diablo, and Aifm3 implies that modeled microgravity-derived oxidative stress may compound the normal, bacteria-induced, development of the light organ in E. scolopes via atypical stimulation of the intrin - sic pathway. The results also indicated that the expression of pro- death caspases was increased in symbiotic animals under modeled microgravity. Caspases are cysteine-dependent proteases that are widely regarded as the core machin - ery of apoptosis and are responsible for mediating the initiation and fallout associated with most known path - ways for cell death 58. This study found that both ini - tiator and executioner-type caspases were up-expressed during accelerated light organ apoptosis in modeled microgravity-treated symbiotic hatchlings compared to gravity controls (Fig. 4). The detection of functional cas - pase enzymes in aposymbiotic controls in the absence of apoptotic cells in the light organ suggests that there is a critical execution threshold for cascade activation. Thus, it appears that the superficial ciliated epithelial cells of E. scolopes light organ are primed for morphogenesis via baseline levels of initiator and executioner caspase activ - ity that are maintained below the activation threshold for apoptosis until the symbiotic cues for development, such as LPS, are received. In symbiotic hatchlings, the increase of transcripts encoding pro-death caspases under LSMMG condi - tions coincided with the early onset and premature peak of developmental cell death (i.e., 6  10 h post inocula - tion) previously observed in the squid 15. Notably, the amount of initiator caspase has been shown to positively correlate with the extent of downstream executioner activation, and to irreversibly induce apoptosis a certain threshold of activity must be surpassed 59. These results suggest that the increased caspase expression in LSMMG may lower the activation threshold of light organ apopto - sis due to the increased availability of proenzymes, which closely parallels previous reports that the concentrations of pro-caspases-9 and -3 are key predictors of apoptotic susceptibility 60. The initiators and executioners of E. scolopes exhibited a high degree of structural similarity to the orthologs of other animals in particular initiators EsCasp2 and EsCasp8 as well as executioners EsCasp3 and EsCasp7 61, 62. However, anomalies were observed in both isoforms of squid caspase-10, which contained a single CARD at the N-terminus rather than a dual DED (Fig. 5). This significant deviation from the structural norm indi - cates that the EsCasp10 sequences were likely misanno - tated, given that their structure more closely resembles that of initiator caspases-2 and -9 63. Additionally, there were deviations in the CASc precur - sor domain of several caspase isoforms in the host squid, such as EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9, where the smaller p10 subunit was not observed (Fig. 5). In animals, the pri - mary sequence of the p10 subunit is subject to greater variation than the larger p20 due to the absence of cat - alytic cysteine and histidine residues, which may have precluded its detection in EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9. Given that an intact CASc region was identified within these isoforms it is like these two isoforms are functional despite the inability to identify the p10 subunits within the CASC precursor domain. Maximum likelihood analysis demonstrated that the initiator caspases of E. scolopes, H. sapiens, R. norvegi - cus, D. rerio, X. laevis, M. galloprovincialis, and O. sin - ensis clustered primarily based on like orthologs (Fig. 6). Page 15 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 The segregation of initiators into three groups bearing high identity to caspases-8 and -10, -9, and -2 is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses that illus - trated further subdivisions between the vertebrates and invertebrates 32, 33. The exclusion of E. scolopes and M. galloprovincialis from the subclade of vertebral caspase-9 orthologs, along with their placement on opposing branches of the unrooted phylogenetic tree next to same- species sequences, implies that lineage-specific variations have occurred in the intrinsic initiator caspases of mol - lusks (Fig. 6). The increased activity of all tested caspases in symbi - otic animals relative to aposymbiotic controls suggests both receptor-mediated and stress-induced apoptosis pathways occurring in the bacteria-induced develop - ment of the host light organ (Fig. 7). However, inhibition of caspases under unit gravity resulted in a decrease of only 50 of apoptotic pycnotic nuclei, suggesting that the normal V. fischeri-induced apoptosis pathways in the light organ of E. scolopes are partially, but not entirely, caspase-dependent. These results align with the previous finding that cathepsin L  a lysosomal, cysteine-depend - ent protease  also contributes to developmental cell death in symbiotic paralarvae 30, suggesting apoptosis in the host animals is mediated by a multi-faceted array of apoptosis-associated proteases that are triggered by both external and intrinsic signals. Under the stress of LSMMG, however, our findings suggest that the increase in apoptotic cell death levels in symbiotic light organs is mediated primarily through caspase activation via the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The phenotype of increased apoptotic nuclei in the light organ under LSMMG was mitigated using caspase inhib - itors, producing statistically equivalent numbers of pyc - notic nuclei compared to unit gravity controls (Fig. 8d). These increases in caspase activity complement our previous findings that GO terms related to enzymatic activity and catalysis were disproportionately enriched in LSMMG-treated paralarvae at 12 and 24 h compared to gravity controls 23. These data also parallel previous studies that showed spaceflight and modeled micrograv - ity-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes and erythrocytes was significantly reduced by caspase inhibition 64, 65. Although most initiator and executioner caspases were up expressed in LSMMG conditions, not all were phar - macologically inhibited. Interestingly, treatment with the Ac-LEHD-CMK caspase-9 inhibitor did not pro - duce a significant reduction in the amount of apoptosis observed under gravity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. 7d). Additionally, no LSMMG-induced increase was observed in the caspase-9 activity, despite the increase in transcript levels at 10 h (Fig. 4; Fig. 8). Given that the recognition peptide of the caspase-9 inhibitor is identical to that of the Caspase-Glo substrate (LEHD-CMK), it is unlikely that this phenomenon derives from differences in binding affinity or substrate specificity with the cas - pase-9 of E. scolopes. Caspase-9 has traditionally been considered an upstream caspase that depends on the binding to the CARD motif Apaf-1 apoptosome for acti - vation 46 and is the first caspase of the ROS-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic cascade 66. Thus, these results suggest there could be alternative pathways for the onset of executioner caspases in the host squid other than cas - pase-9-dependent pathways. For example, apoptosis can be activated through apoptosome-independent mecha - nisms 67, thus more research is needed to understand the role of caspase-9 under both gravity and LSMMG conditions. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that external stresses, such as modeled microgravity, can cause pertur - bations to the normal apoptotic pathways in animals. As many of the mechanisms that E. scolopes use to commu - nicate with V. fischeri are present in other animals (e.g., Lbps) this research provides a framework for understand - ing how animals respond differentially to the stresses of spaceflight in the presence and absence of their symbi - onts. For spaceflight, understanding how disruptions in host-microbe homeostasis and animal physiology alter normal physiological responses, such as apoptosis, is crit - ical. Furthermore, the ability to modulate the life or death of a cell as well as identify mitigation targets or strategies to prevent perturbations of animal-microbe homeostasis has immense therapeutic potential for maintaining crew health for long-duration spaceflight. Methods General procedures Adult E. scolopes were collected from Maunalua Bay on Oahu, HawaiI, and transported to the Space Life Sci - ences Lab where they were maintained in a controlled growth chamber set at 23 C on a 12 h lightdark cycle. Egg clutches laid by the female squid were incubated in separate aquaria from the adults for the entirety of par - alarvae development ( 21 days). Newly hatched paralar - vae were rinsed twice in 0.22 m filtered seawater (FSW), then either preserved in an aposymbiotic state (i.e., with - out V. fischeri) or rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild-type, strain ES114, to a final concentration of 105 cells per mL of FSW. For all experiments, coloniza - tion was confirmed by measuring luminescence with an ATP photometer (GloMax 2020, Promega Corp., Madi - son, WI). For symbiotic experiments, log cultures of V. fischeri were prepared in seawater tryptone broth 68 and incubated at 28C with 225 rpm shaking. For all Page 16 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 experiments, animals were anesthetized and euthanized before examination in a 1:1 solution of 0.37 M MgCl2 and filtered sterilized seawater. Euthanasia by over anesthesia is the current accepted practice for cephalopods 69, 70. Replicates, data treatment, and statistical analyses All experiments were performed in triplicate, with at least three biological and technical replicates unless otherwise noted. Outliers identified via the 1.5  inter - quartile range (IQR) method were removed before anal - ysis, and data normality was assessed via ShapiroWilk (SW). Statistical significance was evaluated either using a Welchs t-test (SW p  0.05) for parametric data or MannWhitney-Wilcoxon U test when the data were not normally distributed (SW p  0.05). Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were two-sided and used a sig - nificance cut-off of p  0.05. Modeled microgravity treatments and DO2 readings To mimic the low-shear fluid conditions of spaceflight, 50-mL High Aspect Ratio Vessels (Fig. 1c; HARVs; Syn - thecon, Houston, TX) were used as previously described 15. Briefly, for aposymbiotic conditions, the HARVs were filled with FSW, whereas for symbiotic conditions HARVs contained 105 cells of V. fischeri ES114 per mL of FSW. After animals were added to the HARVs, the reac - tors were then sealed to prevent the formation of bubbles and incubated at 23 C in a synchronized LED-illumi - nated Percival incubator (Percival Scientific Inc., Perry, IA) with rotation at 13 rpm. The HARVs were either rotated around a vertical axis to control for unit gravity (Fig. 1c left) or were rotated around a horizontal axis to mimic microgravity conditions (Fig. 1c right). The dis - solved oxygen content (DO2) of the FSW collected from the HARVs was also measured at 24 h with a hand-held probe (Sper Scientific, Scottsdale, AZ) in a minimum of three replicates. For control purposes, and to establish a baseline for enzyme assays and inhibitor treatments, a cohort of hatchling animals were incubated in borosilicate scintil - lation vials alongside the HARV reactors until 16 h post- hatching, which marks the peak of developmental cell death in normal gravity 18. For all treatments, at least one animal from each treatment was put aside to con - firm colonization andor quantify light organ apoptosis. The remaining squid were immediately frozen with liq - uid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at  80 C until down - stream analysis. RNA isolation, quantification, and quality assessment For each treatment, RNA was extracted from three dis - sected light organs in triplicate and pooled using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the previously described modifications 23. The resultant RNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Tech - nologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions, and assessments of quality were made using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For the nCounter analy - sis, the RNA samples were diluted to a final concentra - tion of 20 ng per mL of nuclease-free water and stored at  80 C. Transcriptome analysis and NanoString nCounter Preliminary gene selection was made by data-mining the reference transcriptome of E. scolopes 43 for apopto - sis-related KEGG identifiers, GO terms, Pfam accession numbers, and SwissProt annotations (Additional File 1). Target genes were selected for further study by cross-ref - erencing the multi-species KEGG pathway for apoptosis (ko04215) with published analyses in other cephalopods. The selected genes (Table 1; Additional File 2) repre - sent those target genes where probes could be designed. Some apoptosis genes within E. scolopes had numerous isoforms and this not all probes were effective. Three LPS-binding proteins (LBPs) from E. scolopes were also included in the final apoposis-gene CodeSet (Table 1), along with the housekeeping genes actin (actB) and pyru - vate carboxylase (pyc1). Probes to the selected target genes were synthesized at NanoString Technologies, Inc. in Seattle, WA. Each assay included eight negative con - trol probes to evaluate the non-specific background and six synthetic RNA targets with matching positive control probes. NanoString quality control, data processing, and differential analysis The raw NanoString counts from the nCounter assay were processed using nSolver software (ver 4.0) as pre - viously described 71. Quality control was conducted based on imaging quality, probe binding density, posi - tive control linearity, and the limit of detection as estab - lished by the negative controls. Non-specific background signal was subtracted, and the data were normalized to the internal controls and housekeeping genes to adjust between technical and biological replicates. Next, the data were imported into R Studio (ver 1.2.1335) and a ShapiroWilk test was performed to determine data nor - mality. Afterwards, a LIMMA-voom transformation was applied and the output  expressed as log2 counts-per- million (log2CPM)  was used to fit a linear regression model. Finally, the differential expression analysis was computed for pair-wise comparisons using non-paramet - ric empirical Bayes statistics with a Benjamin-Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing (Additional File 2).Page 17 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 Phylogenetic and architectural analysis of caspase enzymes Caspase protein sequences were obtained from the refer - ence transcriptome for Euprymna scolopes  43. Homolo - gous sequences were similarly sourced from the National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for other com - mon research organisms (Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegi - cus, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio) as well as two species (Mytilus galloprovinciali, and Octopus sinensis) within the Mollusca phylum (Additional File 3 ). To compare initia - tor and executioner caspases, a multiple sequence align - ment was generated via MUSCLE (ver 3.8.31) according to the default parameters 72. Maximum likelihood anal - ysis was then performed using MEGA X software (ver 10.2.1) assuming the Whelan-Goldman model of amino acid substitution with 1000 bootstrap iterations 73. The resultant phylogenetic trees were rendered in MEGA X, with branch support values expressed as percentages on the unrooted trees. Separately, the domain architecture of each caspase sequence was analyzed via SMART, Inter - ProScan, and the NCBI Conserved Domain Search 74 76. Estimates of protein isoelectric point and molecular weight were calculated using the ExPASy Compute pI Mw tool (Table 2) 77. The percent identities of the ini - tiator and executioner caspases in E. scolopes were deter - mined via Clustal Omega at the default parameters 78. Light organ protein isolation and quantification To examine enzyme activity during light organ apopto - sis, total protein was isolated from frozen animals. Per extraction, approximately 60 light organs were dissected into an ice-cold hypotonic extraction buffer containing 24 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) supplemented with a custom protease inhibitor cocktail to a final concentration of 2 g pepstatin, 5 g aprotinin, 5 g leupeptin, and 100 g Pefabloc per mL of buffer. The light organs were then homogenized on ice with a ground-glass micromortar and pestle, and the exudate was centrifuged at 15,000  g for 15 min at 4 C to pel - let out debris. The amount of protein in the supernatant was subsequently determined using a Qubit 2.0 fluo - rometer (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Afterwards, the protein extract was diluted with ice-cold extraction buffer and 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 1 mg of protein and 0.45 M NaCl per mL of buffer. All protein extracts were stored at  80 C until use. For each treatment, protein extractions were performed in triplicate. Caspase activity assays To quantify caspase activity in the light organ, Cas - pase-Glo Assay kits (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were used according to the manufacturers instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, equal volumes of pre-warmed Caspase-Glo reagent and light organ pro - tein were combined in a white-walled, flat-bottomed, 96 well plate with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Cas - pase-Glo 37) or 60 M MG-132 proteasome inhibitor (Caspase-Glo 8 and 9) to reduce non-specific signal. The plate was shaken at 400 rpm for 30 s and then transferred to a Synergy microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) at 25 C. Luminescence readings were subsequently collected every 2 min for 2 h. Protein samples were prepared in a hypotonic extraction buffer and assayed in duplicate at a final protein concentration of 20 g per mL of buffer. Duplicate blank reactions consisting of buffer plus proteasome inhibitor were included for each set of samples, and the average was subtracted as background. Protease inhibitor treatments To determine the contributions of different caspases to bacteria-induced apoptosis, hatchling animals were exposed to a series of targeted protease inhibitors. The inhibitors used in this study include the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK, the caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD- CHO, and the caspase 9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) as well as the irrevers - ible serine protease inhibitor, Pefabloc (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All inhibitor solutions were 0.22 m-filter sterilized and stored at  80 C until use. Caspase inhibi - tors were used at final concentrations of 60 and 100 M for vial and HARV experiments, respectively. For all experiments, the final concentration of the serine pro - tease inhibitor Pefabloc was 25 M. These concentrations were chosen in part as they did not cause apparent toxic - ity to the animal and did not impede colonization. Inhibi - tor treatment occurred for 2 h before the start of the experiment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls were run in parallel where appropriate. Quantifying apoptotic development in the CEA of the light organ To visualize and quantify apoptosis in the light organ, hatchling animals were anesthetized and stained in a 1:1 solution of 0.37 MgCl2 and FSW containing 0.001 acridine orange dye, which intercalates into the con - densed chromatin of dying cells (i.e., pycnotic nuclei) 18. After staining, a ventral dissection was performed to expose the light organ, and the pycnotic nuclei in each lobe of the light organ were counted via FITC epi - fluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss Axioplan micro - scope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Page 18 of 20 Vroom et al.

        "conclusion": "s: The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.

A reduction in Earths gravity can significantly change the shear forces, buoyancy-driven convection, and hydrostatic pressures that organisms experience 1 , thus altering critical biological pathways at the cellular, subcellular, and molecular level 2 . One such pathway that can be negatively impacted during spaceflight and microgravity analogs conditions is apoptosis or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process that eliminates damaged and unnecessary cells without inflammation and constitutes a critical lever of physiological homeostasis in multi - cellular organisms 3 . Anomalies in programmed cell death have been attributed to some of the most debili - tating health effects of spaceflight, including muscular Open Access Correspondence: jfosterufl.edu Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, Space Life Science Lab, University of Florida, Merritt Island, FL 32953, USAPage 2 of 20 Vroom et al. BMC Microbiology (2022) 22:202 atrophy, bone demineralization, immune system dys - regulation, cardiovascular deconditioning, and visual impairment 4 , 5. Additionally, rodent studies con - ducted with the hindlimb unloading model, which mimics the reduced weight-bearing of spaceflight through a 30 head-down tilt, have reported higher rates of myonuclear and osteocytic apoptosis during muscular atrophy and bone loss 6 , 7. Other studies have shown that exposure to actual or simulated micro - gravity conditions can induce apoptosis in the leuko - cytes of humans and mice, with effects lingering for up to a week post-flight 8 , 9. Endothelial cells (e.g., coro - nary arteries) also exhibit increased mortality under microgravity conditions 10, which may contribute to cardiovascular deterioration in flight. Collectively, these findings indicate a more intricate understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microgravity- induced apoptosis in animals is needed to ensure the continued health and wellbeing of crew members dur - ing long-term space missions. Indeed, dysbiosis is a well-known consequence of spaceflight and there is compelling evidence to suggest that disruptions in an animals normal, healthy, microbi - ome may be related to dysfunctional apoptotic cell death in microgravity 11, 12. Altered proportions of Firmi - cutes and Bacteroidetes in the gastrointestinal tract of mice have been associated with reduced apoptosis among colonic epithelial cells in modeled microgravity, thus hin - dering tissue turnover 13. Simulated weightlessness has also been shown to induce apoptotic damage in the intes - tinal mucosal barrier of rats, which is paralleled by com - positional changes in the gut microbiome 14. To address these issues, the monospecific mutualism between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scol - opes, and the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio fischeri has emerged as a tractable model system to study the impact of reduced gravity on bacteria-induced changes to host physiology, including apoptosis 15, 16. V. fischeri colonizes a specialized light organ (Fig. 1a-c) in the host squid and produces luminescence that the squid uses at night to conceal its shadow from predators 17. Shortly after E. scolopes hatch, V. fischeri are entrained from the surrounding seawater via ciliated epithelial append - ages (CEA) that border each lobe of the nascent light organ (Fig. 1b), and in so doing, potentiate colonization. Shortly thereafter, microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tracheal cytotoxin, induce a post-embryonic remod - eling event during which apoptosis is widely induced throughout the light organs ciliated fields (Fig. 1c), peak - ing at 16 h 1820. Subsequently, in the days following colonization, these structures completely regress 21 and the light organ undergoes further maturation 22.To simulate microgravity, high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) have been successfully used with the squid- vibrio symbiosis to generate a low sheared modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment (Fig. 1c)  15, 16, 23, 24. Briefly, rotation about a horizontal axis offsets gravi - tational settling such that the contents of each reactor are maintained in a state of constant suspension under low shear conditions that emulate the quiescent fluid dynam - ics of low Earth orbit (Fig. 1c). Rotation about a verti - cal axis, by contrast, allows for sedimentation to occur unperturbed and thus serves as the unit Earth gravity controls (Fig. 1c)  25. The LSMMG environment pro - duced by this ground-based analog has been used for decades to model microgravity, and results obtained with the HARVs have been shown to parallel the findings of many spaceflight studies 25, 26. Previously, studies using the squid-vibrio model in LSMMG revealed that the bacteria-induced development of the light organ is accelerated under modeled micro - gravity conditions (Fig. 1d) 15, however, the mecha - nisms by which these changes occur are unknown. In this study, we characterize several aspects of the apoptosis genetic machinery in the host squid, examine the dif - ferential expression of several of these apoptosis-related genes, and assess the activity and mitigation potential of several initiator and executioner caspases associated with apoptosis under modeled microgravity conditions. The outcomes provide new insight into the mecha - nisms underlying apoptotic dysregulation in response to microgravity-like stress and its potential impact on the physiology of animals and beneficial microbes during spaceflight.",
