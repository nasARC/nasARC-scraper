Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been responsible for over 6.3 million deaths globally in a short span of 2 years (World Health Organization WHO Covid Dashboard ). The causal pathogen of this pandemic is the severe acute respi- ratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped betacoronavirus ( Hu et al. 2020 ). This virus expresses a heavily glycosylated spike protein (S-protein) on its envelope (Belouzard et al. 2012 ). The vaccines have been able to prevent new infections and restrict the severe outcomes of COVID- 19; however, the chances of reinfections in vaccinated people cannot be eliminated, especially with the rapid emergence ofvariants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmission rates and the likelihood of evading host immune responses. The S-protein expressed on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary mode of contact with the host cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), thus determining viral tropism, entry,and pathogenesis ( Belouzard et al. 2012 ). The S-protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein which possesses 2 subunits. The S1 subunit, which is capable of interacting with theangiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and the S2 subunit, which helps in membrane fusion, an event necessary for the internalization of the virus particle in the host cell( Belouzard et al. 2012 ;Tian et al. 2021 ). Natural evolution of viruses involves multiple genetic mutations. However, only those capable of changing theimportant protein structure of the virus lead to consequences in terms of virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, and severity of the disease ( Callaway 2020 ). SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain has acquired many crucial mutations over a short period of time, giving rise to various VOCs (Tian et al. 2021 ). Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India in October 2020 (WHO database), has so far been the most aggressive variant ( Saito et al. 2021 ). The high pathogenicity of delta variant is linked to the 9 amino acidmutations in its S-protein: T19R, G142D, FR156-157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N ( Tian et al. 2021 ). The L452R, T478K, and P681R are key mutations because they result in significant immune evasion and high transmissibility ( Planas et al. 2021 ;Tian et al. 2021 ). The L452R mutation is present in the receptor-binding domain(RBD), a region of the S-protein involved in binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mutation aids in the stabilization of the S-protein-ACE2 interaction, therefore increasing themolecular binding affinity and viral infectivity ( Tian et al. 2021 ). Substitution of the threonine with lysine in T478K changes the electrostatic surface charge of the viral RBD,strengthening the ACE2 binding ( Goher et al. 2021 ). The mutation P681R has been shown to increase proteolytic cleavage caused by furin between the S1 and S2 subunits ofthe SARS-CoV-2 S-protein ( Tian et al. 2021 ), thus increasing the rate of viral fusion and increasing the spread of infection (Saito et al. 2021 ). The L452R mutation has been shown to850 R Dwivedi et al. significantly contribute to the immune escaping ability of the virus when examined against vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma ( Tian et al. 2021 ). Development of therapeutic strategies capable of inhibiting the infectivity of a broad range of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in a reasonably consistent manner is critical. As S- protein binding to the host cell surface HSPGs is one of the first and critical steps in the establishment of the infection, abrogation of the same molecular complex would be ableto reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 ( Clausen et al. 2020 ). The competitive inhibition of S-protein-HSPG binding by administering sulfated glycans like glycosaminoglycans(GAGs) or GAG mimetics, e.g. marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) by our group and others, has shown a significant decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Wuhan-Hu-1strain)( Jin et al. 2020 ;Kim et al. 2020 ;Mycroft-West et al. 2020 ;Dwivedi et al. 2021 ;Song et al. 2021 ;Tandon et al. 2021 ;Guimond et al. 2022 ;Kim et al. 2022 ). In our previous studies with Wuhan-Hu-1 strain S-protein RBD, significant inhibition was achieved by MSGs ( Dwivedi et al. 2021 ). Therefore, it is logical to start testing the MSGs against emerging VOCs. In the current study, we investigate the anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity of MSGs comparatively against both the SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2)strains to examine if the acquired mutations in the Delta variant would lead to any change in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the MSGs. Results and discussion Structural features of MSGs Figure 1 displays all sulfated glycans screened in inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains. The MSGs examined comparatively toheparin, unfractionated heparin (UFH) ( Fig. 1A ), include 3 fucosylated chondroitin sulfates (FucCSs) from sea cucum- bers, 3 sulfated fucans (SFs) from 2 sea cucumbers and 1sea urchin, and 1 sulfated galactan (SG) from a red alga.

The purified MSGs were further analyzed by 22 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(PAGE) ( Fig. 2C and D ) to understand polydispersity distri- bution and to correlate the different molecular weights (MWs) of MSGs with their anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. Their MWdistribution was assessed in comparison with mammalian GAGs of known MWs. The series of holothurian FucCS showed bands between 60 and 100 kDa ( Fig. 2C ). The MW distribution of the homopolysaccharides composed of galactose (BoSG) and fucose (IbSF, HfSF, and LvSF) indicates higher MW for these polymers, 100 kDa ( Fig. 2D ). The MWs of the series of FucCS and SFSG are in accordance with previous publications ( Shi et al. 2019 ;Dwivedi et al. 2021 ;Zoepfl et al. 2021 ), confirming therefore the structural integrity. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Delta strains and cytotoxicity of MSGs MSGs were examined for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV- 2 entry into HEK-293T-hACE2 cells using a baculoviruspseudotyped with S-proteins of WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) ( Fig. 3A and Table S1 ) and Delta (B.1.617.2) ( Fig. 3B and Table S2 ) strains and encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The IC50values of the MSGs ( Table 1 ) demonstrated generally similar activity of heparin (IC 50 0.6 mgL) against the Wuhan strain (range of 0.11.0 mgL) and generally (slightly) weaker activity than heparin (IC 50 0.2 mgL) against the Delta strain (range of 0.15.9 mgL). In the cytotoxicity assays(trypan blue exclusion) on HEK-293T-hACE2 cells, all tested MSGs, except HfSF, exhibited no significant cell death even at the highest concentration of 50 mgL and 60 h of continuousexposure as compared to the mock-treated cells ( Fig. 3B and Table S3 ). Concluding remarks In this study, 7 MSGs were examined, comparatively toheparin, regarding their capacities to block 2 strains, WT(Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2), of SARS-CoV-2.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 marine sulfated glycans 851 Fig 1.

Although each sulfated glycan showed its own inhibitory capacity, the inhibitory activities of the MSGs strains weregenerally similar and (slightly) weaker, respectively, against Wuhan and Delta strains. No correlation between structural features (sulfation pattern, MW, monosaccharide compo-sition, glycosidic linkage, andor anomeric configuration) and anticoronaviral activity was observed. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance ofinhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.

LMWH, UFH (180 IUmg), and CS-Cwere purchased from Sigma. Baculovirus pseudotyped withSARS-CoV-2 WT and Delta variant S-protein containing a GFP reporter was obtained from Montana Molecular (Bozeman, MT, United States). HEK-293T-hACE2 cellswere obtained from BEI resources. Deuterium oxide (D 2O)Anti-SARS-CoV-2 marine sulfated glycans 853 (D 99.90) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA, United States). NMR tubes (3 mm) were purchased from VWR International (Radnor, PA, United States). Extraction of MSGs The sulfated glycansIbSF, IbFucCS, PpFucCS, HfFucCS, and HfSF were extracted from the body wall of sea cucumbers I. badionotus ,P. pygmaea ,a n d H. floridana following the proteolytic digestion procedure reported earlier ( Chen et al. 2011 ,2012 ;Dwivedi et al. 2021 ).The 100 mg of dried body wall was digested using 0.1 mg of papain (0.52 Umg) at60 C (24 h) in 2 mL of digestion buffer (5 mM of cysteine, 5 mM of EDTA in 0.1 M of sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0). The digested mixture was centrifuged (4,000 rpm for 30 min)and the supernatant was precipitated using 2 volumes of 95 ethanol. The precipitate was kept at 20 C for 24 h before centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min. Precipitatewas dissolved in water, dialyzed 3 times against distilled water, and lyophilized. BoSG and LvSF were isolated from the body wall of the red alga B. occidentalis and the egg jelly of the female gametes of L. variegatus ,a sr e p o r t e de a r l i e r( Pomin et al. 2021 ). Purication of MSGs The crude extract (50 mg) was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography (packed with DEAE Sepahcel resin) column (2.520 cm). A linear gradient of NaCl (in 0.1 M NaOAc, pH 6.0) from 0 to 3 M was applied at a flow rate of 18 mLh.The eluted fractions were assayed for the presence of sulfated glycans by 1,9dimethylmethylene blue reagent. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed 3 times against water and werelyophilized. Sugars were further purified on a size exclusion column Sephadex G15 (1 30 cm). NMR analysis The 1D1H NMR spectra of UFH and MSGs (IbSF, IbFucCS, PpFucCS, HfFucCS, and HfSF) were acquired at 25Co n 400-MHz Bruker Avance III HD using a 5-mm BBFO RT probe. The NMR sample was prepared in a 3-mm NMRtube by dissolving 35 mg of pure polysaccharide in 200 L D 2O (99.90). The 64 NMR scans were acquired for each sample involving a relaxation delay of 1 sec with a totalacquisition time of 1 min 41 s. The acquired proton NMR data was processed and analyzed using MestreNova 14.1.0 and TopSpin 4.0 software. MW estimation of MSGs The MW distribution of the purified MSGs was determined on a 1.5-mm thick discontinuous PAGE system having 4 stacking gel and a 22 resolving gel phase. The 10 go f samples dissolved in loading buffer (50 glycerol, 0.5 M Tris, pH 6.8) were loaded into the wells of the stacking gel. LMWH (8k D a ) ,U F H( 15 kDa), and CS-C ( 60 kDa) were run alongside the MSGs as MW markers. Electrophoretic migration was carried out at 100 V in 0.25 M of Tris-Glycine running buffer. The migration of bands was tracked by 0.02bromocresol green dye. Gel was stained using 0.1 (wv) toluidine blue (in 1 acetic acid) for 1 h and was destained using 1 acetic acid ( Vasconcelos et al. 2018 ;Dwivedi et al. 2021 ).Viral inhibition of MSGs The virus inhibitor screening was done on human embry-onic kidney cells (HEK-293T) expressing human ACE2 (HEK-293T-hACE2 cell line, BEI Resources NR-52511) plated in a 96-well tissue culture plate using baculoviruspseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta S- proteins (C1110G and C1123G, respectively) containing a green fluorescent reporter (Montana Molecular, C1123G)( Dwivedi et al. 2021 ;Tandon et al. 2021 ;Yan et al. 2021 ). Virus titers were confirmed by enumerating GFP-positive transduced cells in a dilution series under a fluorescencemicroscope (EVOS-FL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and by multiplying by the dilution factor with the volume plated. Serial dilutions (50, 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005 mgL) of the test MSGs were made in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium in triplicates to the final volume of 100 Li ne a c h well. The controls used were UFH at 50 mgL and mock- treated cells. The 2.5 L of the pseudotype virus stock (210 10units per mL) was mixed with the test compounds and was incubated for 1 h, which was then laid over HEK- 293T-hACE2 cells plated in a 96-well plate along with 2 mM of sodium butyrate. Plate was then incubated for 60 h andthe assay was read on a Cytation 5 automated fluorescence microscope after fixing with 3.7 formaldehyde. The relative IC 50values were calculated in Prism 9 (Graphpad Inc.) by plotting normalized values from the assay against the concentrations (log) of MSGs and controls and analyzing by nonlinear regression to fit a doseresponse curve using theleast-squares method considering each replicate value as an individual point. Cytotoxicity of MSGs Cytotoxic potential of MSGs was examined against HEK- 293T-hACE2 cells seeded in 12-welled tissue culture platesfollowing the protocol reported earlier ( Dwivedi et al. 2021 ; Tandon et al. 2021 ). Briefly, the confluent HEK-293T-hACE2 cells were treated with MSGs at a final concentration of50 mgL along with 2 mM of sodium butyrate. The cell viability was estimated via trypan blue exclusion assay upon harvesting the treated cells after 60 h of incubation. Assayreadout was measured on a TC20 automated cell counter (BioRad) according to the manufacturers protocol. Supplementary material Supplementary material is available at GLYCOB Journal online.

        "introduction": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been responsible for over 6.3 million deaths globally in a short span of 2 years (World Health Organization WHO Covid Dashboard ). The causal pathogen of this pandemic is the severe acute respi- ratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped betacoronavirus ( Hu et al. 2020 ). This virus expresses a heavily glycosylated spike protein (S-protein) on its envelope (Belouzard et al. 2012 ). The vaccines have been able to prevent new infections and restrict the severe outcomes of COVID- 19; however, the chances of reinfections in vaccinated people cannot be eliminated, especially with the rapid emergence ofvariants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmission rates and the likelihood of evading host immune responses. The S-protein expressed on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary mode of contact with the host cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), thus determining viral tropism, entry,and pathogenesis ( Belouzard et al. 2012 ). The S-protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein which possesses 2 subunits. The S1 subunit, which is capable of interacting with theangiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and the S2 subunit, which helps in membrane fusion, an event necessary for the internalization of the virus particle in the host cell( Belouzard et al. 2012 ;Tian et al. 2021 ). Natural evolution of viruses involves multiple genetic mutations. However, only those capable of changing theimportant protein structure of the virus lead to consequences in terms of virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, and severity of the disease ( Callaway 2020 ). SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain has acquired many crucial mutations over a short period of time, giving rise to various VOCs (Tian et al. 2021 ). Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India in October 2020 (WHO database), has so far been the most aggressive variant ( Saito et al. 2021 ). The high pathogenicity of delta variant is linked to the 9 amino acidmutations in its S-protein: T19R, G142D, FR156-157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N ( Tian et al. 2021 ). The L452R, T478K, and P681R are key mutations because they result in significant immune evasion and high transmissibility ( Planas et al. 2021 ;Tian et al. 2021 ). The L452R mutation is present in the receptor-binding domain(RBD), a region of the S-protein involved in binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mutation aids in the stabilization of the S-protein-ACE2 interaction, therefore increasing themolecular binding affinity and viral infectivity ( Tian et al. 2021 ). Substitution of the threonine with lysine in T478K changes the electrostatic surface charge of the viral RBD,strengthening the ACE2 binding ( Goher et al. 2021 ). The mutation P681R has been shown to increase proteolytic cleavage caused by furin between the S1 and S2 subunits ofthe SARS-CoV-2 S-protein ( Tian et al. 2021 ), thus increasing the rate of viral fusion and increasing the spread of infection (Saito et al. 2021 ). The L452R mutation has been shown to850 R Dwivedi et al. significantly contribute to the immune escaping ability of the virus when examined against vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma ( Tian et al. 2021 ). Development of therapeutic strategies capable of inhibiting the infectivity of a broad range of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in a reasonably consistent manner is critical. As S- protein binding to the host cell surface HSPGs is one of the first and critical steps in the establishment of the infection, abrogation of the same molecular complex would be ableto reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 ( Clausen et al. 2020 ). The competitive inhibition of S-protein-HSPG binding by administering sulfated glycans like glycosaminoglycans(GAGs) or GAG mimetics, e.g. marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) by our group and others, has shown a significant decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Wuhan-Hu-1strain)( Jin et al. 2020 ;Kim et al. 2020 ;Mycroft-West et al. 2020 ;Dwivedi et al. 2021 ;Song et al. 2021 ;Tandon et al. 2021 ;Guimond et al. 2022 ;Kim et al. 2022 ). In our previous studies with Wuhan-Hu-1 strain S-protein RBD, significant inhibition was achieved by MSGs ( Dwivedi et al. 2021 ). Therefore, it is logical to start testing the MSGs against emerging VOCs. In the current study, we investigate the anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity of MSGs comparatively against both the SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2)strains to examine if the acquired mutations in the Delta variant would lead to any change in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the MSGs.",
