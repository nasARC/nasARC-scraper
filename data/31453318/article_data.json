Micro- gravity, accordingly, markedly alters musculoskeletal physiology. 13 For example, the soleus mass decreases by over 30 after 3 weeks in microgravity,4and femoral bone strength declines by 2 for every 100 days in space.5,6But the most important consequences lie in the risks encountered when astronauts return to Earth andare subjected to standard gravity; indeed, the dramatic decreasein muscle size, strength, and endurance 7produces long-term consequences including chronic muscle fatigue and persistent lowback pain.8,9 While considerable information has been gathered concerning the physiological adaptations of the human body to weightless- ness,10,11long-term studies are rare and longitudinal assessments remain limited due to the dif culty to obtain muscle biopsy data on astronauts in- ight. For this reason, researchers have relied on several animal models, most notably the rat hindlimb unloading(HLU) protocol developed in 1979 by Morey et al. which has beenestablished as the standard approach 12,13for ground-based research. However, this model puts considerable stress on therat tail, which can lead to blood ow restriction, in ammation, and necrosis. More importantly, the HLU model is not suitable toinvestigate the effects of partial gravity that will be encounteredwhen astronauts reach extra-terrestrial targets such as Mars (38of Earth gravity, or 0.38 g) and the Moon (16 of Earth gravity, or 0.16 g), or when they are exposed to arti cial gravity induced by continuous centrifugation. 14An innovative partial weight-bearing (PWB) model, incorporating a tail-suspension and body harness,has been developed in mice, allowing normal activity for up to3 weeks at several different levels of PWB. 15,16However, rats are generally considered a better animal model for space ight studies since their physiological processes, including drug metabolism, are considered more analogous to those of humans.17Accordingly, we recently modi ed this mouse PWB model for rats18by substituting a pelvic harness for the tail suspension, thereby providing a less stressful experience with improved reliability. In the present study, we sought to extend our initial18work for up to 4 weeks and assessed the functional muscle alterations that occur in three different PWB levels (70, 40, and 20 of normal loading). Additionally, we harvested muscle tissues on days 7, 14, and 28 to obtain a comprehensive timeline of muscle atrophy at these different levels of PWB. By doing so, we can provide a detailed picture of the muscle alterations induced by a reduction of the mechanical load. This longitudinal study provides the rst step for better understanding the impact of space missions in which stays on the Moon and Mars are planned. RESULTS The consistency of the PWB level achieved was high (Fig. 1a). Indeed, all unloaded groups displayed minimal differences between their achieved and desired PWB level, which was further demonstrated by low coef cients of variation (PWB70: 0.54, PWB40: 1.20, PWB20: 0.95). Actual body mass without the harness was recorded weekly (Fig. 1b), and at all time-points, PWB animals displayed a signi cantly different body mass change compared to the normal loading (PWB100) controls. Despite exhibiting a transient and signi cant loss of body mass in the rst 14 days, all groups reached a body mass signi cantly above their baseline but lower than the PWB100 control rats after 28 days of suspension. Calf circumference (Fig. 2) steadily increased over time in the control (PWB100) group, while it decreased signi cantly during therst 2 weeks in all PWB groups compared to their baseline (Fig. 2a). After 28 days of suspension, all animals displayed a calf circumference greater than their baseline, but control group Received: 8 December 2018 Accepted: 31 July 2019 1Department of Neurology, Harvard Medical School Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA and2Department of Orthopedics, Center for Advanced Orthopaedic Studies, Harvard Medical School Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA Correspondence: Marie Mortreux (mmortreubidmc.harvard.edu)www.nature.comnpjmgrav Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAvalues remained signi cantly higher than all other values. From 1- week onward, all PWB groups displayed a signi cantly lower grip force compared both to the controls (PWB100) and their respective baseline values (Fig. 2b). Nerve-stimulated plantar exion force was measured only on days 0 and 28 (Fig. 2c). The control animals (PWB100) showed an increase in their area under curve (AUC) after 4 weeks ( 5.1 mN s), which was signi cantly greater than in all the other PWB groups. Each unloaded group displayed a reduction of the AUC in a dose- dependent manner after 28 days of suspension, ranging from 2.7 mN s for the PWB70 groups and 5.9 mN s for the PWB40 group, to 6.7 mN.s for the PWB20 animals. This dose-dependent decrease over a 1-month period was assessed by performing a linear regression among the groups ( R20.98, p 0.0001). Additionally, the maximal impulse recorded at 28 days ofsuspension can be normalized by the combined wet mass of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (triceps surae) in order to determine muscle quality (Supplementary Table 1). This parameterhighlighted the linear correlation ( p0.043 using a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test for trend) between the different groups, ranging from 9.87  1.64 mN s g 1for the control group to 6.14  1.25 mN s g1for the rats exposed to PWB20, suggesting a reduction in the intrinsic force generating capability of the muscle due to PWB. At each time point (i.e., 7, 14, and 28 days) hind limb muscles were dissected and wet mass was recorded (Fig. 3). After 7 days, the PWB20 group showed a signi cant reduction in soleus mass compared to controls ( 14.89  2.87, p 0.05); PWB70 and PWB40 animals displayed substantial but non-signi cant reduc- tions (10.24  3.20 and 8.54  3.35, respectively, Fig. 3a). After 14 days, all unloaded groups had a signi cantly lower soleus mass as compared to the PWB100 controls in a dose-dependent fashion. This nding remained observable at 28 days for the PWB20 and PWB40 groups but not for the PWB70 group despite a mean reduction of 9.53  2.96 ( p0.11, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey s post hoc test). In contrast, the mass of the gastrocnemius muscle did not differ signi cantly for any PWB group as compared to PWB100 control animals for the rst 2 weeks of the experiment (Fig. 3b). However, after 28 days of partial unloading, the animals exposed to PWB40 displayed signi cant muscle atrophy compared to the PWB100 controls ( 11.14  2.41, p0.013, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey s post hoc test), as did the animals exposed to PWB20 ( 9.00  4.27, p 0.05). On day 7, quadriceps femoris wet mass (Fig. 3c) was signi cantly reduced only in the PWB20 group compared to the controls ( 10.69  1.66, p 0.05, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey s post hoc test). On days 14 and 28, all experimental groups displayed signi cant quadricepsatrophy compared to the controls at PWB100 in a clear dose- dependent fashion. Using quantitative histomorphometry, we measured the average cross-sectional area (CSA) of the myo bers in both soleus (Fig. 4a) and gastrocnemius (Fig. 4b) muscles, which have been extensively studied for their adaptation to microgravity. In both muscles and under all reduced PWB conditions and time points, i.e., 7 days (Fig. 4c), 14 days (Fig. 4d), and 28 days (Fig. 4e), the unloaded groups displayed a signi cantly smaller myo ber CSA than the PWB100 controls. Moreover, myo ber atrophy followed a signi cant linear trend across groups plotted against their degree of PWB (R2values for the soleus are: 0.79, 0.89, and 0.83 for 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. R2values for the gastrocnemius are: 0.39, 0.97, and 0.99 for 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively). Additionally, we observed a ber type switch in these two muscles of the unloaded rats compared to the PWB100 controls (Supplementary Table 2). While accounting for only approximately40 of the soleus myo bers in mice,19type 1 bers (i.e., slow- twitch, oxidative) normally comprise from 80 to 94 of the myobers in the soleus muscle in humans and in rats20,21We observed a similar percentage of type 1 myo bers in the soleus muscle in our control PWB100 group, ranging from 90.96  1.25 to 88.68  1.81 between the different time points. In contrast,the number of type 1 bers decreased (and presumably the number of type 2 bers (i.e., fast-twitch, glycolytic) increased) in the soleus muscle with decreasing PWB level. For example, after14 days of suspension, the percentage of type 1 bers decreased in the soleus to 85.32  2.65 for the rats at PWB70, 78.51  2.07 at PWB40, and 84.08  2.13 at PWB20. The opposite trend wasobserved in the gastrocnemius muscle, which is composed predominantly of type 2 bers in normal conditions (PWB100) and displayed an increasingly higher percentage of type 1 bers in the increasingly unloaded groups. The ber-type switch that we observed has been reported previously in the literature, 22,23and has been described as a preferential atrophy according to musclelocation and ber-type. The extent of ber-type switching increases with time ( p0.0019, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey s post hoc test) and reduction in PWB level ( p0.0484, using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey s post hoc test). However, although we visually observed a consistent trend in ber-type switching in the gastrocnemius, we did not detect statistically signi cant differences between PWB groups in this muscle.

Mortreux et al. 2 npj Microgravity (2019) 20 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA1234567890():,;reduced mechanical loading on muscle health, with several muscle parameters presenting dose-dependent alterations. The multiple time points allowed us to observe alterations in musclefunction and mass as early as 7 days after exposure to reducedloading that appeared to become greater over time (Fig. 2b). The early muscle de cits that we observed here using our recently developed PWB model 18,24and are well described in the hindlimb unloading literature2527emphasize the need for mitigating strategies immediately after a reduction, even partial, in mechan- ical loading. Muscle impairment was further con rmed with the dose-dependent diminution in both the maximal torque obtainedafter a tetanic stimulation of the tibial nerve on day 28 (Fig. 2c), and the normalized tetanic impulse values at 28 days (Supple- mentary Table 1), therefore stressing the intrinsic loss of musclefunction that correlated with reduced load. These physiologicalchanges were also con rmed by the reduced hindlimb muscle mass (Fig. 3) and were associated with a reduction in myo ber cross sectional area (Fig. 4). These data are analogous to those previously observed after 21 days of PWB in mice. 15,16For example, when exposed to PWB20, soleus and gastrocnemius mass were reduced by 22 and 10, respectively, compared to the control animals. Furthermore, similar to our ndings, this previous work reported that the loss of muscle mass was dose- dependent and correlated to the PWB levels. As in prior human and animal studies, both in space or using ground-based analogues,4we observed that the soleus muscle atrophied to a much greater extent than the gastrocnemius with a signi cant decrease in type 1 slow-twitch oxidative bers (Supplementary Table 2). Based on this immunostaining, weassumed that this was correlated to an increase in the proportionof fast-twitch glycolytic myo bers; however, this assumption should be con rmed in future work by speci cally staining for fast- twitch bers, which we did not do. This effect on musclecomposition has been extensively studied in the context of microgravity 1,28,29although the changes do not always reach statistical signi cance.30,31However, the non-signi cant trend we observed in the gastrocnemius (i.e., a visible increase in slow-twitch bers as seen in Fig. 4b), which is a mixed- ber type muscle, has only been described in the context of neuromuscular disorders such as spinal bulbar muscular atrophy.32In this disorder, the cellular shift often precedes symptoms includingmuscle atrophy, and is thought to be caused by a metabolic dysfunction. Indeed, in this pathology, early changes in gene expression seem to be responsible for the alteration of theglycolysis process, which in return, is contributing to the myo ber type shift by modifying skeletal muscle metabolism and substrate availability. Analogously, prediabetic and metabolic symptomssuch as insulin resistance are often experienced by astronautsduring their missions. 33,34Thus, it would be interesting to further investigate the metabolic changes that are induced in our model, including skeletal muscle insulin-resistance, mitochondrial respira-tion and overall energy homeostasis, to determine if thesemechanisms, which are known to impact the muscle tissue, contribute to the shift in myo ber type or are a consequence of it. Our future studies based on RNA sequencing, and aiming atunraveling the modulation of gene expression during PWB, will need to assess these additional parameters to better understand the underlying mechanisms. Our PWB model offers the possibility of assessing the time- course of the musculoskeletal alterations across the spectrum of mechanical loading to better understand the underlying mechan- isms of muscle loss and performance de cits. Muscle force, and therefore function, is a critical aspect of the astronaut health sinceit is essential for the ef cient performance of a wide range of tasks.

Mortreux et al. 3 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2019) 20 represent a major impairment after landing, when astronauts are suddenly re-exposed to gravity. Interestingly, our results highlightthat even a 30 decrease in mechanical loading (i.e., PWB70) induces substantial reductions in muscle force and size that do not recover after a month of suspension (Fig. 2c). The effects of partial gravity, as would be experienced by astronauts visiting Mars orthe Moon or via centrifugation-induced arti cial gravity, are far less studied than the effects of complete weightlessness due to the prior lack of established animal and human models. Theground-based PWB model we developed will allow for furtherinvestigation of the potential health impacts of partial mechanical unloading and could represent the rst step toward nding solutions to protect astronauts during long-duration spacemissions. While successful, there remain several limitations to this model. First, we observed an initial transient decline in body mass; andalthough within an acceptable range (i.e., 10 of the initial bodymass), as it is experienced in all ground-based models as well as in astronauts themselves, 3538this body mass loss can create some bias in non-invasive assessments such as limb girth. Second, unlikehumans, rats display constant growth, which also involves themusculoskeletal system. Indeed, the increase in muscle wet mass and in the average myo ber cross-sectional area was visible in our cohort of fully-loaded (PWB100) controls between different time-points. However, it has been described that after the initial and rapid growth period, male rats grow at a constant rate between 10 and 30 weeks old before showing signs of aging, 39thus conrming our choice in using 14 18-week-old animals. Another limitation of this work is that we did not attempt to quantify nocturnal or daytime behavior. However, in order to get some sense of their overall behavior, video monitoring wasinstalled within the animal facility and qualitative differences inbehavior among groups were not observed. Despite being quadrupedal animals, rats brie y but regularly display some bipedal behavior, mainly occurring during environmentalexploration and feeding, and such bipedal behavior was visible in all groups. While not noticeably greater in the reduced PWBgroups, these brief bipedal occurrences represent a change in the animals unloading status that was not preventable. Moreover, due to their quadrupedal locomotion, many factors divergebetween humans and rats, and this model cannot account forall such differences. Additionally, we also did not obtain a continuous measure of ground reaction forces. This should certainly be considered for future work. Finally, we have not fullycharacterized the stress levels in our animals. While our behavioralassessments, including food intake, grooming, and physical assessments were helpful and are widely used to identify whether animals are under stress, it will be necessary to sample blood andor feces at different time points to assess the level of corticosterone for an accurate measurement of the animals stress. This model has a number of potential uses beyond simply providing a ground-based analogue for different levels of partialunloading. First, it can serve as a testing ground for studies of therapeutic agents or exercise countermeasures in partial unload- ing. 40This is especially true since, if needed, it is extremely easy to remove the animals from the PWB harness for short periods of timeto administer medications by injection or perform other assess- ments. Similarly, for exercise countermeasures, the model allows for relatively normal positioning and thus it would be possible, forexample, to out t a cage with a treadmill apparatus, allowing animals to perform in normal or reduced loading conditions. Likewise, by incorporating other hazardous events that occur duringspace ight, such as radiation exposure, the model could also address the impact of the combined effects of PWB and radiation exposure to muscle health. 41,42Moreover, the model could be used as a tool to assess the impact of sequentially altering loading levels.For example, a fully hind-limb suspended rat could then be placedin PWB40, so as to mimic an astronaut traveling from Earth to Mars and then landing on Mars, assessing the effect of partial unloading on an already compromised musculoskeletal system. 24Alternatively,71 4 2 80.150.200.250.30 Days of suspensionSoleusmass (g)PWB70 PWB40PWB100 PWB20a 71 4 2 82.02.53.03.54.0 Days of suspensionGastrocnemiusmass( g) PWB70 PWB40PWB100 PWB20 b 71 4 2 82345 Days of suspensionQuadriceps Femoris mass (g)PWB100 PWB70 PWB40 PWB20c  Fig. 3 Muscle wet mass after 7, 14, and 28 days of PWB.

Mortreux et al. 4 npj Microgravity (2019) 20 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAthe model could be used to assess the impact of the gradual mechanical reloading, via the progressive reintroduction ofincreased PWB, as means of re-acclimating safely to full Earth gravity after an extended period in space. In summary, we developed a PWB for rats capable of simulating various mechanical loading environments while maintaining a quadrupedal stance. This model, rst developed to investigate the impact of reduced weight-bearing environments observed at extra- terrestrial targets such as the Moon or Mars, additionally bringsvaluable insights about the potential mitigating effects of applying articial gravity during space ight to preserve muscle health.METHODS Animals Wistar male rats, n149, (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing a mean  standard error of 408  0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22  range of 2 C)room with a 12:12-h light dark cycle. Water and rat chow were provided ad libitum and monitored daily. Rats were regularly assessed for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyric staining around the eyes, poorgrooming, and hair loss), harness and jacket tting, ability to walk and move across the cage, food and water intake. Additionally, fully loaded and partially loaded mass measurements were recorded daily.

For all experiments requiring anesthesia, vaporized iso urane (1.5 3.5) oxygen was used and body temperature was maintained using a water- blanket (Gaymar, Inc., Orchard Park, NY) set at 37 C (Fisher Scienti c, Hampton, NH, USA). At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation and hind limb muscles were harvested and weighed on a precision analytical balance (Fisher Scienti c, Pittsburgh, PA). PWB suspension model Animals were placed in four different groups: normal loading (PWB100, n 38), 70 of normal loading (PWB70, n36), 40 of normal loading (PWB40, n36), and 20 of normal loading (PWB20, n39). In each group, 12 animals were euthanized on day 7 and day 14 for ex vivo tissue analysis. Onday 28, 12 15 animals per group were euthanized. At the beginning of the study, rats were distributed to ensure a balanced distribution of the body weights across all groups. Forty-eight hours prior to day 0 (baseline)assessment, rats were placed in custom cages and jackets for acclimation.Beginning on day 0, and after obtaining the pre-suspension measurements, animals were subjected to either normal loading (PWB100) or other PWB levels using the model designed in our previous work. 18Briey, rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a 2-pointsuspension allowing them to maintain quadrupedal behavior whileweighing 100, 70, 40, or 20 of their initial body weight. Animals were weighed daily and if necessary the PWB apparatus was adjusted to ensure that their achieved unloading level remained constant within a 5 marginerror of their desired PWB level, by modulating the chain length of thesuspension device. Rats were positioned over a digital animal scale (ZIEIS,Lakeville, MN, USA) and their mass at PWB100, including the mass of the suspension device, was recorded. Then, the unloaded mass was obtained and the recorded level of PWB was calculated every morning by using theratio of these two measurements. Calf circumference Under iso urane anesthesia, animals were placed in a prone position with the left hind limb positioned at a 45 angle to the spine. The left leg wasshaved using a hair clipper (Braintree Scienti c, Braintree, MA, USA), and three measurements of the calf circumference were obtained at the tibial mid-shaft using a suture thread at baseline and after 7, 14, and 28 days of suspension. Each thread was then measured with a micrometer (FisherScienti c, Hampton, NH, USA) and the average of the three measurements was recorded. Rear paw grip force Rats rear paws were placed on a 50 N capacity digital grip force meter(Chatillon, Largo, FL, USA) and gently pulled backward until the animalreleased its grip. The peak force generated was measured by a forcetransducer linked to the bar. Three tests were performed with a short rest period of at least 30 s between each trial, and averaged. Results were expressed as the percentage of each animal s grip force measured at baseline (i.e., pre-suspension). Foot plate plantar force generation Under anesthesia, rats were placed on a force plate (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System, Aurora Scienti c, Aurora, ON, Canada), and their left foot was securely taped on the foot plate. Monopolar electrodes (28 G, NatusMedical Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA, USA) were used to deliver a tetanic,supramaxial stimulation of the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa at a frequency of 200 Hz, for 200 ms. The maximal torque response was recorded and the AUC was calculated. Muscle histomorphometry After euthanasia, the left gastrocnemius, soleus, and quadriceps femoris muscles were harvested and the wet mass of each muscle was determined using a precision analytical balance. The soleus and gastrocnemius muscleswere then placed in 10 buffered formalin and xed for 48 h (histological analysis was not performed on quadriceps femoris). Samples wereembedded in paraf n blocks, sectioned into 10 micron slices and double immuno uorescence staining was performed using anti-collagen VI antibody (ab6588, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-slow skeletalmyosin heavy chain antibody (ab11083, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).Stained slides were subsequently imaged at 20 using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 epi uorescence microscope and ber area was measured using the muscle morphometry plug-in (Anthony Sinadinos using Eclipse IDE) andFIJI (FIJI, ImageJ, NIH) with examiners blinded to PWB level and duration. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with Graphpad Prism 7.2 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla,CA) using one-way ANOVA for terminal measurements, followed byTukey s post hoc test or the linear test for trend.
