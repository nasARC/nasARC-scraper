The biological mechanisms underlying the role of gravity in human health remain poorly understood, but their elucidation is necessary for enabling long-term manned space exploration. Numerous studies, sup- ported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other space agencies, have shown deleterious effects of space travel on the human body, such as accelerated bone loss,1,2muscle tissue degeneration,3and others.4Importantly, these observations may have broader implications beyond space ight applications to provide a more detailed understanding of diseases on Earth. In particular, the musculoskeletal system has historically been a focal point in space biology research, because of the strikingly adverse changes that occur in astronauts.5More recently, studies have begun to investigate mesenchymal stem cells for their roles in musculoskeletal lineage determination,6bone repair,7and tissue maintenance.8 Although the most relevant environment for performing micro- gravity research is in space, competition to use space-based facilities, like the International Space Station, is erce and is further complicated by substantial time and resource investments.9As a result, lower-cost and logistically simpler alternatives are attractiveand include sounding rockets10and parabolic ights,11or in-lab devices such as random positioning machines12and clinorotation devices (clinostats)13to simulate microgravity. The selection of a speci c technique usually depends on accessibility, cost, experi- mental design, and research question. Clinostats are among the most accessible methods to simulate microgravity, and they allow researchers to study living cells using standard laboratory tissue culture supplies.14 Clinorotation experiments have provided signi cant insight into the behavior of biological organisms in space. The technique wasoriginally developed to study gravitropism in plant development, and has revealed that gravity serves a key role in statocyte function, which is believed to be directly involved in plant gravisensing and growth patterns.15In animal and human cells, clinorotation has been used to recreate experiments that would otherwise be challenging to perform in space, such as high-resolution microscopy16and assessment of stem cell differentiation.17Cellular changes in microgravity have been associated with disruptions in the cytoskeleton and, consequently, changes in cell morphology and behavior.18,19 Although clinorotation is a standard ground-based tool, previously reported studies on the effects of simulated micro-gravity in mesenchymal stem cells have yielded con icting ndings (Table 1). For instance, some researchers have shown that microgravity enhances proliferation,17whereas others have 1Fischell Department of Bioengineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA;2NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA and3Department of Orthopaedics, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.Correspondence: AH Hsieh (hsiehumd.edu)Received 12 March 2015; revised 15 May 2015; accepted 12 June 2015www.nature.comnpjmgrav All rights reserved 2373-806515  2015 Macmillan Publishers Limiteddemonstrated inhibition.20Chondrogenic differentiation has also been found to be either promoted21or suppressed.22Similar inconsistencies have also been highlighted in a recent review.23 Some of these observed discrepancies could be due to differences in culture media formulation and cell source, but it is also possible that the choice of clinorotation parameters used for an experi-ment may substantially in uence cell behavior. A two-dimensional clinostat rotates a sample along the longitudinal axis to produce a time-averaged nulli cation of the gravity vector. Theoretically speaking, to simulate microgravityeffectively, the period of rotation should be shorter than some time constant that governs the rate processes involved in the cellular gravisensing machinery that enable a cell to perceive and respond to the changing trajectory of the gravity vector. Forconventional clinostats, however, there are also practical con- siderations that limit the angular frequency of rotation. 24 Speci cally, rotation speed must be adjusted to balance sedimentation forces, centrifugal and Coriolis effects, and Stokes  drag. Because of these constraints, the parameters of angular rotation depend on the particular design and implementation ofeach experimental system. To minimize the effects of these extrinsic stimuli, we recently developed a lab-on-chip clinorotation device (clinochip, Figure 1a) that con nes adhered cells within a small region along the axis of rotation, limiting residual accelerations to levels below 10 4ga t different rotation speeds.25Moreover, the clinochip is amenable to time-lapse microscopy, which enables us to characterize the kinetics of cell spreading, changes in morphology, and migration with minimal disruption to the simulated microgravity environ-ment. In this study, we used this device to investigate how angular frequency affects human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) behavior. On the basis of the concept that there are speci c rate processes that govern cellular gravisensing (Figure 1b), we hypothesize thathMSCs would exhibit angular frequency-dependent responses. The results of this work demonstrate that hMSCs can in fact detect  differences in rotation speed in a manner that causesheterogeneous population shifts toward more rounded morphol- ogies and retraction of cell area. This could have signi cant implications on our basic understanding of stem cell regulation aswell as on strategies that are being used in stem cell-based applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials hMSCs were obtained from a commercial source (PT-2501, Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA), and con rmed to be mycoplasma-free. Clinochip fabrication required microscope slides (12-544-1, Fisher Scienti c, Wal- tham, MA, USA) and 0.25- mm-thick polydimethylsiloxane sheets (HT-6240,Rogers Corporation, Rogers, CT, USA). Fluorescence visualization wasperformed for actin using 5 (wv) Texas red phalloidin (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and for focal adhesions using 1 gml uorescein- conjugated anti-vinculin (MA1 34629, Life Technologies). Fibronectin (354008, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to enable celladhesion, and nerve growth factor (NGF; 7S-NGF, Life Technologies) wasused for migration experiments. Calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer-1(L-3224, Life Technologies) were used to perform cell viability assays. Experimental setup In general, we used a single experimental system for all of our experiments,as detailed previously.25In brief, the system consists of a custom microscope-mounted gear system, driven by a computer-controlledstepper motor that rotates a small slide holder.25This slide holder can accommodate various custom and commercially available lab-on-chip devices. A non-rotating slide holder enables having a static (standard gravity) control condition performed concurrently. The entire system isenclosed in an environmental chamber (Precision Plastics, Beltsville, MD,USA) and installed on an Olympus IX-81 epi- uorescence microscope (Center Valley, PA, USA). Cell morphology platform A custom clinochip device was used for visualizing cell spreading (that is, changes in cell morphology over time), and fabricated according to ourpreviously described protocol.25This clinochip consists of three layersTable 1.

In brief, we used a high-resolution razor cutter (FC8000, Graphtec, Irvine, CA, USA) to trim stock polydimethylsiloxane sheets. The sheet was cut to length and width dimensions of microscope slides and with a single 1-mm wide, 30-mm long channel at the center. A second microscope slide was used as the third layer. Prior to assembly, two 1-mm diameter holes had been made in the top slide using a sandblaster (6500, Airbrasive, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to provide access to the channels. The three layers were energetically bonded using a high-frequency corona treater (BD- -20AC, Electrotechnic Products, Chicago, IL, USA). The clinochip was rst sterilized for 20 min in a UV chamber. To promote cell attachment, the channel was then treated with 100 gml bronectin for 1 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline before use. Passage 3 (P3) and P4 hMSCs were seeded into clinochip channels and incubated at 37 C for 10 min to allow for cell attachment, followed by commencement of clinorotation. Cell migration platform Cell migration was analyzed using commercially available Ibidi Chemotaxisslides ( -Slide Chemotaxis 2D, Ibidi, Munich, Germany). The slides t perfectly in our clinorotation device and the 2  1 mm dimensions of thechamber are suitable for simulated microgravity, as they constrain cells to a narrow region about the axis of rotation to minimize centrifugal effects. First, a 100 gml bronectin solution was injected into the viewing chamber and incubated for 1 h, followed by three phosphate-buffered saline washes. Then, P3 and P4 hMSCs were plated and incubated at 37 C for 12 h of initial seeding time. Our pilot experiments showed that after 12 h the spreading areas of hMSCs reach a plateau so that cell spreading would not confound the cell migration data. As a rst step, we chose to study hMSC chemotaxis mediated by NGF, one of several growth factors identi ed in this active eld of research.26Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to express receptors to neurotrophic factors including NGF,27 and also secrete NGF during tissue repair.28In these migration experiments, NGF was prepared as a 100 ngml solution and injected into the top ports of the chamber. Following manufacturer s instructions, the same volume was aspirated from the opposite port to create a chemical gradient. Clinorotation and time-lapse imaging Both morphology and chemotaxis platforms were rotated along the axis ofthe channels in which cells were cultured. Residual accelerations are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional clinostats, even at 75 rpm.25Before the experiment, we made sure that the channels did not contain any bubbles, to minimize any other external effects such as shear stress and dehydration. During imaging, we constrained our analyses to cells near the axis of rotation, away from the sides of the channel, to avoidpotential edge effects. At the appropriate times (10 min after seeding for morphology assays; 12 h after seeding for chemotaxis and migration assays to allow the cells tobecome fully spread), clinorotation was initiated at 30, 60, or 75 rpm and maintained over the course of 8 h. Clinochips at 0 rpm (non-rotated) were used as a control (standard gravity). During each hour, rotation was paused for a total of 60 s, and a set of bright- eld images of the clinochip were acquired at  200 magni cation. At the end of the 8 h period, cells were xed in 4 paraformaldehyde, and uorescently stained for actin and vinculin. Captured images were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation Cell viability was determined using calcein-AM (green) to indicateintracellular esterase activity for live cells and ethidium homodimer-1 (red) to indicate loss of plasma membrane integrity for dead cells. Calcein (nal concentration 4 M) and ethidium homodimer ( nal concentration 2M) were added to cell culture media that was used to plate hMSCs in bronectin-treated clinochips. After 10 min of attachment, clinochips were either rotated at 75 rpm or maintained at standard gravity conditions (non- rotated control) and uorescence micrographs were taken at 1, 4, and 8 h during clinorotation. In addition to the livedead assays, we acquired light micrographs of cell morphology in standard gravity following exposure to (a) 1 or 4 h of 30 rpm clinorotation, (b) 1 or 4 h of 60 rpm clinorotation, or (c) 1, 4, or 8 h of 75 rpm clinorotation. After termination of the clinorotation treatment, images were acquired in standard gravity every 30 min for 4 h, and then analyzed for cell area and shape factor using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Statistical analyses Because no prior publications have quanti ed cell areas during clinorota- tion, we relied on pilot data for descriptive statistics to make sample size calculations. Assuming a critical signi cance level of  0.05, statistical power of 0.9 (  0.1), and a detectable difference equal to the population s.d., we performed a power analysis to calculate an estimated sample size ofn 23, using the method of Sokal and Rohlf.29To ensure adequate statistical power for cell area measurements, we chose to include at least n 30 for each sample group (Table 2), acquired over several experimental replicates. All data are expressed as mean  s.e.m. Variance did not markedly differ between groups (less than fourfold). Average cell areas among different clinorotation speeds were rst log transformed to improve normality. Differences between clinorotation groups were then statistically analyzed using the Welch st-test for samples with unequal variance and unequal sample size, with Tukey post hoc tests for multiple pairwise comparisons. Using Welchs t-test for samples with unequal variance and sample size, we analyzed differences in cell velocity and directionality between 0(n 15) and 75 rpm ( n 6) only for cells that were actively migrating. Similarly, we used Welchs t-test with Tukey post hoc test for multiple Figure 1. Framework of how perceived gravity may bias cellular events under clinorotation.

RESULTS Simulated microgravity affects cell spreadingSimulated microgravity had a profound effect on both the extent and kinetics of cell spreading (Figure 2). After the initial 10-min cell attachment and before rotation commenced, all of the groupspossessed similar cell areas of  500 m 2. We found that hMSCs in the non-rotated 0 rpm condition (i.e., standard gravity) markedly increased spreading areas within 1 h after plating, reaching an average of 2000 m2. Their spreading area increased gradually with time, until they reached an average of 3000 m2by 8 h. For clinorotated groups, cell spreading was impeded almost immedi- ately. At 1 h, cells in the 30 rpm group were signi cantly smaller than control with an average cell area slightly above 1000 m2; cells at 60 and 75 rpm were both signi cantly different from 0 and 30 rpm, remaining rounded and small. The effects of clinorotation continued to affect cell spreading over the course of the entire 8 hexperiment in a rotation speed-dependent manner. By 8 h, wemeasured a statistically similar but smaller average area of 2750 m 2for cells at 30 rpm. In contrast, the 60 rpm group had an average area of 2192 m2, and the 75 rpm group had the lowest cell area of 1500 m2, both statistically smaller than 0 and 30 rpm. From a kinetics perspective, the time required for cell spreading areas to reach 2000 m2was within 1 h for non-rotating controls, within 4 h for 30 rpm, and within 8 h for 60 rpm. Our experimentsdid not run long enough to determine whether or not cells wouldreach this mark for the 75 rpm condition, but based on the observed trends, it appears that cell spreading no longer increases after 7 h. These results indicate that cell spreading is markedlyaffected by angular frequency and that these effects can be observed as soon as 1 h after clinorotation starts. Finer temporalresolutions and longer durations in future experiments mayprovide more detailed insight on the time constant of important cellular processes associated with cellular gravisensing. One notable observation we made was that cells within each clinorotation speed were not uniformly spread. As individual cells did not accurately represent the population characteristics, we plotted the group-wise distributions of cell morphologies atvarious time points (Supplementary Figure 1). The 0 rpm controlgroup adopts a broad distribution of cell areas within the rst hour, followed by the 30 and 60 rpm groups. By 8 h, it is clear that the 0, 30, and 60 rpm cell populations encompassed comparableranges of cell areas. The 75 rpm group, however, exhibited a muchmore narrow distribution. Likewise, when staining for lamentous actin we found that cells also spanned a range of cell shapes within each group (Supplementary Figure 2). There were nodiscernable differences in actin organization between cells ofsimilar morphology (elongated or rounded), even when compar- ing across different clinorotation conditions. This suggests that the observed population differences with angular frequency is causedby disparate effects on individual cells, perhaps by triggering overcoming some intrinsic signal within cells to reduce cell adhesion, suppress actin stress ber formation, and consequently induce cell rounding. It is unclear whether simulated microgravitydirectly affects actin stress ber assembly to result in cell rounding, or whether cell rounding induced by simulated microgravity is what inhibits stress ber formation. To quantify these differences in cell shape as a function of clinorotation speed, we computed circularity (circularity  4 area perimeter 2), as it accommodates more abstract shapes than an aspect ratio calculation. We assigned circularity values above 0.6Table 2.

Figure 2. Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) spreading areas in simulated microgravity.

Note that increasing the rotation speed resulted in less- spreading area over time. NS Indicates statistically similar averageareas ( P40.05). ( b) Representative micrographs of hMSCs spreading in a glass substrate coated with FN at different rotation speeds for8 h (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm). Note that cells at a speed of 30 rpm weremore similar to control, whereas cells at 60 and 75 rpm haveadopted a more rounded morphology.Effects of angular frequency on hMSCs C Luna et al 4 npj Microgravity (2015) 15007  2015 Macmillan Publishers Limitedto cells that were considered rounded (Figure 3, black), values between 0.3 and 0.6 to semi-elongated cells (Figure 3, hatch) and values below 0.3 to elongated cells (Figure 3, gray). As expectedfrom the previous area measurements, Figure 3 clearly shows that increasing clinorotation speed results in a larger percentage of rounded cells in its population. The number of elongated cells was signi cantly reduced with increasing clinorotation speed, and no elongated cells were found at 75 rpm. Plotting cell circularity against cell area for each clinorotation speed at different time points, we clearly see a temporal increasein area associated with cell elongation in 0 rpm control cells (Supplementary Figure 3). This trend becomes disrupted with exposure to 30 and 60 rpm clinorotation, as cells tended to exhibita broad range of circularity and area. However, only at 75 rpm the does cell population maintain high circularity and smaller areas across time points (1, 4, and 8 h). Overall, our morphology analysis demonstrates that the cell population at 75 rpm possesses a more consistent morphology (average area, cell distribution, circularityversus area over time) over time. Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation To determine whether there was any loss of viability or if rounded cells were undergoing apoptosis, we exposed cells to 75 rpm and used a livedead assay after 1, 4, and 8 h of clinorotation (Figure 4b).We found no difference in cell via bility or changes in cell number when compared with control; in fact, the majority of cells were alive(490). Under light microscopy, we observed no evidence of apoptosis (i.e., membrane blebbing) for the cells that were not viable. This also indicates that our clinoc hip system can be used effectively without loss of cells due to lifting or cell death for at least 8 h. We investigated whether clinorotation effects on cell morphol- ogy are reversible by performing time-lapse microscopy after exposure to 1, 4, and 8 h of 75 rpm clinorotation. Following cessation of clinorotation, all cells increased their areas and roundcells became more elongated, similar to most of the cells in standard gravity controls (Figure 4a). Similar experiments were also repeated for 30 and 60 rpm after 1 and 4 h of clinorotation(Supplementary Figure 4). Simulated microgravity inhibits cell migration by inducing cell rounding For cell migration experiments, cells were seeded in Ibidi chemotaxis chips with a chemical gradient of 100 ngml NGF topromote cell migration. Under clinorotation, only a few cells migrated, whereas most cells did not (see Table 2 for cell numbers). Cells that were actively migrating at 75 rpm had a similar velocity ( P 0.391) and directionality ( P 0.822) when compared with control cells (Figure 5). Cells that were not migrating Figure 3. Human mesenchymal stem cell shape as function of time at different rotation speeds. We analyzed the shapes of hMSCs at different rotation speeds as a function of time for 1, 4, and 8 h; black rounded cells, line pattern semi-elongated cells, gray elongated. Cells were stained with phalloidin (actin, red) and representative micrographs were selected for each morphological con guration. At 0 rpm, cells were rounded at the rst hour and were mostly elongated at the end of our time lapse. At 30 rpm, the number of elongated cells was reduced but still present at 4 and 8 h. At 60 rpm, there were no elongated cells at 4 h and there were mostly semi-elongated cells at 8 h. At 75 rpm, the number of rounded cells increases at every time point.Effects of angular frequency on hMSCs C Luna et al 5  2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited npj Microgravity (2015) 15007under simulated microgravity exhibited morphological retraction (Figure 5). In other words, cell areas changed from fully spreadmorphologies to more rounded ones. This phenomenon is inagreement with our observations in cell-spreading experiments, even when the initial conditions were different (10 min for spreading assays versus 12 h for chemotaxis and migration assays).We found that during clinorotation cells retracted their area, but did so independently of rotation speed ( 0hP 0.539, 1hP0 . 2 8 8 , 2hP0 . 9 6 3 , 3hP0 . 8 4 8 , 4hP 0.689, between 30 and 75 rpm). After 4 h of clinorotation during chemotaxis, cells at 30 and 75 rpm reached an average area of 2500 m 2, which is a value similar to the spreading experiments for 30 rpm at 8 h ( P 0.962 Figure 4. Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation. ( a) Cell spreading dynamics were measured for cells after 1, 4, and 8 h of clinorotation at 75 rpm. Four hours after clinorotation was terminated, cell areas were observed to increase by a factor of 1.4 1.8 times.

Analysis of chemotactic migration of human mesenchymal stem cells in simulated microgravity. Cells stimulated by a chemotactic signal (NGF) in microgravity exhibited one of two behaviors: migration or retraction. Under simulated microgravity, most cells retracted (N17) and only some cells ( N6) actively migrated. Cells that were actively migrating (left), had a similar velocity ( P0.391) and directionality ( P0.822) in simulated microgravity to those in non-rotated conditions. Cells that did not migrate retracted their area as a function of time. This behavior was similar at different clinorotation speeds ( P0.698 at 4 h between 30 and 75 rpm). Results indicate that the morphological response to microgravity is stronger than the response to the NGF chemotactic signal. NGF, nerve growth factor.Effects of angular frequency on hMSCs C Luna et al 6 npj Microgravity (2015) 15007  2015 Macmillan Publishers Limitedbetween 30 rpm, P 0.975 between 75 rpm). However, we did not conduct experiments long enough to determine steady state  retracted cell areas. Our results indicate that the cellular response to simulated microgravity is more dominant than chemotactic signals, suggest-ing the role of migration of hMSCs to tissue repair sites might be suppressed in microgravity. We base this conclusion on our observations of response to NGF at a concentration of 100 ngml.However, these results were obtained with only one concentrationof NGF and it is possible that different concentrations or other chemotactic molecules can elicit a stronger chemotactic response. For example stromal-derived factor-1, which is known to be astrong homing signal for hMSCs. 30Nevertheless, because the response of adhered cells to clinorotation is retraction of cellular processes, we believe that the behavior will be similar, unless the chemotactic agent can also enhance cell adhesion. DISCUSSION Understanding how angular frequency, or rotation speed, of clinorotation affects cell behavior is a critical aspect of micro- gravity simulation experiments, so that the role of the changing gravity vector in cellular regulation can be appropriatelyconsidered. In this work we show that hMSCs can behavedifferently depending on clinorotation speed. In particular, although average cell area increased more slowly at 30 rpm compared with non-rotated controls, it continues along anupward trajectory at 8 h and seems to be converging with control values. For higher rotational speeds, cell area increases even more slowly, and appears to reach a plateau by 8 h at 75 rpm. Thissuggests that changes in cell morphology may approach a limit atan angular frequency that is close to 75 rpm, and almost certainly must exceed 30 rpm. Although these results are relevant to our clinochip con guration, results may vary for other clinostat devices, particularly for those that support cells in suspension. Our results are consistent with other research showing that rotation speed affects animal cells, plants, and bacteria ( Escherichia coli). For example, a study on osteoblastic ROS 172.8 cells reported that rotations at 10 and 40 rpm did not exhibitreproducible, detectable changes from stationary control cells. 31 Only a speed of 50 rpm showed reproducible changes in actincytoskeleton and cell surface integrin 1 and apoptosis. The same effect has been observed with E. coli,32which exhibited differential response as a function of clinorotation speeds from 10 to 50 rpm. Interestingly, the difference between 40 and 50 rpmis only 0.1674 of a cycle per second, indicating that cells can behighly sensitive to small changes in angular frequency. Although a precise gravisensing mechanism has yet to be determined, it must be one that can detect subtle alterations toexternal forces in a short period of time. Our data indicate that it islinked to pathways that are involved in cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization, two phenomena that have been observed for different cell types. Potential candidates could beone or more molecules already known to play important roles in cellular mechanoregulation, such as the Rho family of GTPases, 33 ion mechanosensitive channels,34intracellular calcium,35nuclear deformations,36focal adhesions, or other cell surface receptors.37 Although mechanosensitive pathways seem the most direct apparatus for gravisensing, others have also suggested the importance of external environmental factors including uid shear, uid and nutrient exchange, oxygen content, buoyancy, and changes in the extracellular matrix.38Thus, clinostats used to probe candidate gravisensing receptors should minimize external environmental variables that arise from clinostat operation. In the context of a proposed framework for cellular gravisens- ing, the current results are consistent with our working hypothetical model (Figure 1b). Standard gravity would con-stitute a constant gravitational stimulus and be detectable to allcells. With intermediate timescales of gravitational nulli cation, the probability for a single cycle of rotational perturbation toevade gravisensing in each cell would assume a broad distribu-tion. As any putative biochemical gravisensing reaction(s) would be stochastic, the probability for gravisensory evasion in each cell would decrease with both lower angular frequency and exposureto longer duration perturbations. We did in fact observe suchtrends, as a result of the time lapse, single-cell measurementcapabilities of the clinochip system. For our clinochips, we do not expect that centripetal forces have a role with our observed angular frequency-dependence, as residualaccelerations were calculated to be on the micro-scale regime. Inaddition, because the capillary number (indicative of viscous forces)is orders of magnitude smaller than surface tension, uid shear forces are deemed negligible. There is also no enhanced nutrienttransport that accompanies clinorotation in our system. Without these confounding factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that the cell morphology differences we observed were predominantly dueto changes in the angular frequency of clinorotation. We believe the rounding and retracted cell area of hMSCs in simulated microgravity inhibit migration in the presence of achemical gradient. Interestingly, the kinetics of cell area changesduring retraction were different from those during spreading, andwere also angular frequency independent, suggesting that distinctgravisensing mechanisms may regulate different processes.Similarly, other cell processes, and even cell fate, could beaffected. 39In the same way that microgravity may produce these cellular alterations, other mechanical stimuli and substrate characteristics can also modulate cell function.40 Stem cell morphology has a strong correlation with cellular phenotype and differentiation potential.41,42It has been demon- strated in prior work that spread cells have a higher tendency to undergo osteogenesis and that cells with rounded morphologiesare more susceptible to adipogenesis.42Because of the short-term nature of this current study, it is not possible to establish whetherhMSCs in our system would behave according to these trends.However, our data would suggest that cells at 30 rpm clinorotationwould be more amenable to osteogenic differentiation, whereascells at 75 rpm would tend toward adipogenic or chondrogenic lineages. This may help explain the con icting reports on mesenchymal stem cells differentiation during clinorotation thatwe and others 23have observed. Future longer-term studies with the clinochip are required to explore hMSC differentiation potential.Speci cally, as we have shown that the population distribution of cell morphologies can be controlled by the angular frequency ofrotation, we may be able to derive cellular phenotypes desirable forstem cell renewal, repair, and tissue engineering.
