This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1 ,PIN3 ,IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave ank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 ( UBQ1 ) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower ank and downregulated in the upper ank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription prole reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution proling using SPGE revealed that the transcription prole of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription prole with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes. Keywords: Brassica rapa ; Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE); germination; gravitropism; hypocotyl; root 1. Introduction Gravitropism is dened as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-lled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplies the root graviresponse  1. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription prole of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main growth regulator in plants that affects differential elongation  2 and is the main agent in complex processes that in- cludes transport  3, and interaction with other phytohormones  46. Auxin effects depend on metabolic activity  7, cytoskeletal interaction  8,9, ions  1013, and light  1418. Auxin regulates primary and lateral root growth  19,20, branching  21, and differentiation  22. The coordinated response to the integrative effect of these factors determines the rate and degree of curvature. Therefore, differential growth responses depend on auxin-mediated processes and gene expression. Plants 2022 ,11, 1191. https:doi.org10.3390plants11091191 https:www.mdpi.comjournalplantsPlants 2022 ,11, 1191 2 of 15 Auxin is synthesized predominantly in meristematic tissue such as shoot and root apices  23, developing seeds  24 and young leaves  25 and transported away from the site of synthesis. Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the reverse fountain model  2. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA ow based on their localization in the plasma membrane  26. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specic tissues 27. PIN1 is typically present in xylem associated cells in shoots and roots  23 and is essential for efux of the auxin anion from vasculature to root apices via protophloem cells  28,29. In roots, PIN3, 4, and 7 are localized on the plasma membrane of different tiers of columella cells  30; they direct the auxin ow from columella cells to the root cortex. PIN3 and PIN7 move to the plasma membrane along the lower side of columella cells in horizontally reoriented roots  31, which results in asymmetrical auxin transport. PIN4 in the quiescent center mediates auxin efux towards the columella cells  32. The auxin sink in the root cap contributes to the asymmetric auxin distribution in reoriented roots  33. Polar localization of PIN2 in the plasma membrane of the lateral root cap and epidermal cells directs the auxin ow toward the cortical and epidermal cells  34,35. Any auxin asymmetry leads to differential growth in the elongation zone 36. In hypocotyls, sedimenting amyloplasts are found in the endodermis  37,38, which acts as gravisensing layer in dicots and is essential for the graviresponse  3941. PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis  28 and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation 42. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent  43 and a mutation in the PIN3 gene affects differential growth  42. Hence, PIN3 is an important factor for shoot graviresponse  43. The PIN3 homologs PIN4 and PIN7 are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse  43. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse  44. A mutation in ARG1 affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls  45 but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes  46. PIN1 re- localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic  47, and gravitropic response  48 and PIN1 mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) in Arabidopsis thaliana inorescence axes  49. Another Auxin Response Element promotes IAA5 , a member of AuxIAA gene family, which has been identied as one of the early and primary response genes 50,51 that are governed by auxin 52. Based on these auxin networks, we chose to compare the transcription levels of PIN1 , PIN3 ,IAA5 and ARG in vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls of Brassica rapa . Since Ubiquitin (UBQ) is highly expressed  53 and used as a reference gene  5456, its transcription level was used as a reference to assess changes in the transcription of auxin responsive genes. Despite many studies on PAT in hypocotyls and on effects of auxin on gene expression 57,58 during graviresponse  59, spatio-temporal differences in gene regu- lation during hypocotyl curvature have not been studied. Typically, total RNA is extracted by pooling the samples from the same region from several seedlings, which prevents the assessment of gene transcription at precise locations in the tissueregion under considera- tion. High spatial resolution is desirable as size, age and development is likely to affect transcription and expression proles  60. In addition, auxin-induced transcription is likely to follow a temporal prole that cannot be assessed by destructive sampling methods. We used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE)  59,61, which relies on mRNA binding to functionalized probes and allows for the repeated sampling of tissue. The temporal and spatial changes of transcription proles during the initial hypocotyl curvature indicate an auxin-based regulation of positive and negative hypocotyl curvature.Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 3 of 15 2. Results 2.1. Time Course of Curvature As reported earlier  1, dicotyledonous plants such as Brassica, Radish and Flax show a bi-phasic and combined graviresponse of the root-shoot axis. The time course of curvature involves a transient curvature of the root tip. Upon straightening of the tip, the hypocotyl base begins to respond as positively gravitropic. The graviresponse is completed after about 20 h. The sampling intervals were chosen to coincide with the onset of hypocotyl curvature (four hours after reorientation), the midpoint of curvature (45-degree curvature of the hypocotyl; 11 h) and vertically oriented seedlings (48 h after the initial reorientation). 2.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction, Yield, and Reference RNA extraction of tissue was performed along the upper and lower ank of the basal hypocotyl from tissue extraction or by Solid Phase Gene Extraction (Figure 1). Figure 1. (A) Extraction of mRNA using Solid Phase Gene Extraction: Oligo-dT15 functionalized stainless-steel needles were inserted into the upper and lower side of horizontally placed hypocotyls and the root tip of Brassica rapa seedlings. The hybridization between the dT and poly A tail of the mRNA was accomplished in 60 s. ( B) Drawings that represent hypocotyl curvature during the experiments. ( C) Sampling of the upper and lower ank of hypocotyl tissue. The average cDNA yield was based on the amount of cDNA after reverse transcription. The tissue extraction (258 16g) was signicantly higher ( p 1010) than the yield from SPGE probes (0.654 0.024 g). Nonetheless, reliable qPCR experiments of SPGE samples were possible. Although UBQ1 transcription was not steady (Figure 2), the changes were small in comparison to auxin-sensitive genes and UBQ1 transcription between the upper and lower ank remained similar ( p 0.75) throughout the experimental period (Figure 3); therefore, UBQ1 is an acceptable reference gene.Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 4 of 15 Figure 2. Absolute Cq values for UBQ1 obtained by tissue extraction (solid lines) and SPGE (patterned lines). The top ank showed reduced (higher Cq values) transcription compared to the bottom ank.

Time  0 refers to vertical position. Transcription of UBQ1 did not change signicantly after reorientation ( p 0.75); meanSE,n 9. 2.3. Transcription in the Hypocotyl Base Tissue The transcription of auxin related genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were similar on the left and right anks of vertically oriented hypocotyls (Figure 4) but changed after horizontal reorientation. PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were downregulated along the top ank but upregulated in the bottom tissue. PIN1 transcription did not change during the rst four hours but after 11 h of reorientation increased in the lower ank and decreased along the upper ank. At that time, all genes showed maximal changes in transcription activities (Figure 5).Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 5 of 15 Figure 4. Absolute Cq values of the investigated genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 obtained after extracting tissue of the left and right ank of a vertically grown B. rapa seedlings. MeanSE,n 9. Figure 5. Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in tissue samples of the upper (black) and lower (red) ank of hypocotyls of horizontally reoriented Brassica rapa seedlings four and 11 h after reorientation relative to the transcription of UBQ1. The transcription was upregulated in the bottom ank and downregulated in upper ank. The least signicant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean SE,n 9. The transcription analysis by SPGE showed similar proles as the tissue data. The downregulation of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 along the top coincided with upregulation along the lower ank (Figure 6) four and 11 h after reorientation. After 48 h, when the hypocotyl approaches vertical position, this trend of transcription expression was reversed, i.e., transcription was upregulated in the upper ank and downregulated in the lower anks.Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 6 of 15 Figure 6. Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 after Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) of curving Brassica rapa hypocotyls relative to UBQ1 values. Probe 1 (apical end of curvature zone), 2 (center), and 3 (basal end, at rootshoot junction) sampled the upper ank (black lines) and probes 4, 5 and 6 sampled the corresponding positions along the bottom ank (red lines), see Figure 1. The transcription proles are shown for 4, 11 and 48 h after horizontal reorientation. Positive and negative values indicate up- and downregulation, respectively. The least signicant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean SE,n 9. SPGE sampling showed the largest difference in transcription at the point of the maximum curvature (probe 2 and 5, Figure 1) compared to the adjacent positions after four and 11 h. The ratio of the fold change over time of all genes at position ve vs. two varied by gene and showed the smallest signal after 48 h (Figure 6). Considering the transcription for probe two and ve (the points of maximal curvature on the convex and concave ank, respectively, for different time points showed that after four hours, the ratio for PIN1 and ARG1 was similar. IAA5 transcription was twice as high at the bottom (5) than top (2) position. At 11 h, PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 showed similar values for the convex and concave sites. The polarity of IAA5 was less, but still reached about ve times the value of the top ank. After 48 h, the values were reversed and the polarity for PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 between the top and bottom side was about six to eight-fold; the polarity for IAA5 was weaker. These data show that after reversal of the curvature the transcription of the examined genes reached a comparable but reversed polarity as after 11 h. 2.4. Tissue and SPGE Extraction The average of the transcription values of all three SPGE probes on either ank was compared with corresponding tissue data of the lower and upper ank. The SPGE values for all examined genes were similar or slightly higher than the tissue values. The overall prole for all tested genes was comparable for both methods, i.e., upregulation along the bottom ank and downregulation in the upper side until 11 h after reorientation (Figure 7). Consistently, this trend was reversed after 48 h. The transcription of all genes showed the greatest variability 11 h after reorientation, consistent with the onset of curvature reversal from positive to negative.Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 7 of 15 Figure 7. Comparison of transcription proles of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in B. rapa seedlings in tissue after four and 11 h of reorientation (upper panel) and SPGE extraction (lower panel) after four, 11 and 48 h reorientation. The data for SPGE top and bottom refers to the average values of the combined probes 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6, respectively. All values are shown as fold change based on UBQ1. MeanSE,n 9. 2.5. Comparison of the Hypocotyl and Root Tip As illustrated  1, the hypocotyl responds to gravity in sequentially positive and then negative curvature. In contrast, the root tip always exhibits positive gravicurvature. Therefore, a comparison of both tissues shows the extent and magnitude of synchronous changes in the transcription of relevant genes. ARG1 showed the highest transcription value compared to the other examined genes (Figure 8). The transcription of all genes increased strongly at four hours followed by a gradual increase at 11 h after reorientation. SPGE showed upregulation for both PIN1 and ARG1 at all times after reorientation. PIN3 transcription remained constant until four hours after reorientation, followed by continued but reduced upregulation. Although IAA5 increased in the tissue (red line) this gene remained unchanged for SPGE data. Interestingly, the magnitude of upregulation for all genes at 11 h after SPGE extraction was in the range of the earlier tissue data points, except for ARG1. Therefore, a drastic difference in values was observed. Similar to the root tip, we considered the average of the hypocotyl tissue (i.e., the average of top and bottom anks) and found that the transcription levels of all genes were similar ( p 0.25) for the hypocotyl and root tip regardless of orientation or time after reorientation.Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 8 of 15 Figure 8. The transcription prole of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in the root tip after horizontal reorientation of B. rapa seedlings. Data were tissue (red) or SPGE (black) sampling of the 2 mm tip region. The transcripts were referenced to UBQ1. The least signicant difference (LSD) was calculated separately for tissue and SPGE samples. Mean SE,n 3. 3. Discussion 3.1. UBQ1 as Reference We veried the usage of UBQ1 as a reference, as UBQ1 expression in both sides of the vertical and top and bottom anks of the curving hypocotyls did not change signicantly (Figure 2). The observed, minor changes in UBQ1 may not be related to curvature but the effect of development andor differentiation. Hence, UBQ1 was identied as a reference gene  62 and it was equally expressed in the upper and lower anks of the gravicurving roots of the Brassica rapa seedlings 59. 3.2. Transcription of Auxin Related Genes The transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse ofB. rapa and is likely mediated by auxin as auxin-induced elongation along the convex side of hypocotyls coincides with the upregulation of these genes, while the concave side shows the reduction in transcription. The connection of these genes with auxin is well established  29,63,64, and at least for PIN1 and PIN3, the transcription pattern over time was identical (Figure 5). The initiation and termination of bending  65 is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin ow to the upper ank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl 1. The differential elongation 4 corresponds with the observed transcription changes and indicates the dependency of basal hypocotyl curvature on auxin mediated processes. The consistent pattern of initial upregulation along the bottom ank and eventual reversal contradicts the notion that hypocotyls curve negatively gravitropic but are in line with earlier observations that young basal hypocotyls of B. rapa , Linum usitatissimum and other dicots behave similarly to roots and bend positively gravitropic during early growth periods. This behavior reverses as the hypocotyl matures and the orientation of the primary root has been established 1. 3.3. Spatio-Temporal Changes during Hypocotyl Curvature The location of tissue and progression of curvature affect gene expression, repres- sors, and other auxin signaling factors  66. The varying transcription of genes in B. rapaPlants 2022 ,11, 1191 9 of 15 roots  53, indicates transcription differences along the curving hypocotyl; their variance over time should coincide with temporal and spatial changes of curvature and related gene expression. All examined genes exhibited changes in their transcription in the up- per and lower ank (Figures 3 and 57) of gravicurving hypocotyl over time. The initial upregulation in the lower ank and downregulation along the upper ank is in line with the observed downward curvature in young hypocotyls  1. The increased transcription activity along the lower ank is indicative of auxin-induced growth inhibition. As the downregulation of all genes on the upper ank at the beginning of hypocotyl curvature (four hours) is greater than the upregulation on the bottom side, the differential ratio (updown, Figures 5 and 6) is high and suggests auxin ow to the lower ank. At the midpoint of hypocotyl curvature at 11 h  1, the auxin asymmetry reaches its maximum and is likely associated with the tipping point  3 that leads to the subsequent reversal of curva- ture at about 35 h for PIN1 and IAA5, and 30 h for PIN3 and ARG1. This sequence coincides with the reversal of hypocotyl downward curvature. The transition in gene transcription implies a shift in either lateral auxin transport or auxin sensitivity, possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species or reductive factors  67. The signicance of this observation is the ensuing change of curvature from positive to negative gravitropic and that it reaches the typical negative gravitropic curvature that is characteristic of mature hypocotyls. Although the transcription prole 48 h after reorientation was not equal on both anks, the data suggest that the hypocotyl curvature for the different curvatures rely on the same genes but does not address what causes the reversal of auxin sensitivity over time. However, the effect of auxin levels and ensuing gene transcription will also be affected by the cessation of the ability to elongate; therefore, the maturing tissue no longer responds to changes in auxin-mediated development and the reversal in hypocotyl curvature, i.e., negative gravitropism, depends on tissue that is still expanding. The high-resolution SPGE analysis revealed changes in the transcription prole within the curving tissue (Figure 6). The greatest polarity was associated with the central probes (2 and 5), therefore SPGE proling is sensitive to spatial differentiation and expansion. The differences between the central and distal probes illustrate both auxin effect and the spatial dependency of gene activation. Future work will investigate if vertically oriented hypocotyls show maturation-dependent changes in gene transcription. The combination of sensitivity, age, and stimulation (auxin) are likely to control (differential) elongation Despite the overall similarity in the assessment of transcription activities, there were differences between the individual genes and sampling positions. Notably PIN1 and PIN3 showed its lowest transcription after four hours at the apical-most upper position and increased without reaching a minimum at 11 h. The same trend prevailed for IAA5 and ARG1 (Figure 6). Possibly, the apical region is less sensitive for curvature, and thus, inhibition. Another consideration relates to the expression of PIN3 and ARG1 in the endodermis  46 and their involvement in shoot gravitropism  43 via polar auxin transport. Therefore, the signal may not have been maximal as SPGE sampling clearly involved cortical tissue. Nonetheless, the polarity of all examined genes was higher for SPGE than for tissue analyses (Figure 5 vs. Figure 6), supporting SPGE-based sampling as a valuable tool for the study of physiological processes. IAA5 is considered a gravitropic response indicator as its distribution reects gravity- induced auxin asymmetry  68. IAA5 had the highest transcription levels (lowest Cq values, Figure 4). However, its lateral polarity was less than that of the other examined genes. 3.4. Comparison of Root Tip and Hypocotyl The root tips of horizontally oriented seedlings reach a vertical position after four hours of reorientation  1. Therefore, lateral auxin gradients are likely to not exist at longer times. The comparison between root tip tissue and SPGE sampling shows that both sampling methods detect a similar change in transcription, but tissue samples show larger signals during curvature. Since no concave or convex tissues were sampled, the signal likely reects a general increase in transcription. SPGE shows a similar increase, but after a signicantPlants 2022 ,11, 1191 10 of 15 delay. Both sampling proles showed a comparable order of activation. The notable exception was IAA5, which was substantially higher in the tissue and remained unchanged in SPGE samples. This discrepancy may stem from a higher mRNA quantity in tissue that was not represented in SPGE extracts such as the developing stele or epidermis  69. The rapid increase in all transcripts in tissue samples occurred over a longer time in SPGE samples. This increase is not related to curvature but likely illustrates the increase in transcription as the root ages or sensitivities change during vertical orientation. Changes in sensitivity with age have been documented previously  1,70,71 and indicate that despite the lack of curvature-specic differences, root tips are a suitable reference for hypocotyl- related changes in gene transcription. This notion likely extends to other species that show a biphasic response in hypocotyl curvature. Equally important is the conrmation that the positive and negative hypocotyl curvature depends on similar hormonal signaling mechanisms as root curvature. 3.5. Comparison of RNA Extraction Techniques Although the yield of tissue extraction is about 400 times the yield of SPGE extraction (see Section 2.1), SPGE data show greater polarity than tissue extraction (Figures 57). The large tissue quantity not only diminishes the differential signal but is problematic as large quantities make differential sampling unreliable. The much higher spatial resolution of SPGE avoids such complications, is accurate, and can readily and repeatedly determine RNA proles without purication  61. Overall, the data show that SPGE allows for mRNA proling at high spatial resolution that is useful for the determination of transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli in plants and other biological systems. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Plant Material Seeds of Brassica rapa vs. rapa were germinated at 25C in darkness between germi- nation paper that was positioned on top of ve mm thick oral foam to avoid thigmotropic stimulation of roots upon emergence. Seedlings with an average root length of 10 mm were used for experimentation 42 h after imbibition. All experiments were performed in moist petri dishes. 4.2. Gravistimulation and Tissue Sampling Vertically grown and positioned seedlings were reoriented such that the entire seedling was positioned horizontally. Before reorientation and 4 and 11 h after reorientation, the hypocotyl was dissected into two parts (leftright for vertical controls and upperlower for horizontally oriented seedlings). Samples obtained after 48 h did not include tissue samples as the tissue size after 48 h of additional growth exceeded the extraction capacity. The apical two mm of the root tip were removed using a scalpel and used as additional reference tissue. All tissue samples were immediately submersed in liquid nitrogen. 4.3. RNA Extraction Total RNA extraction of tissue (hypocotyl and 2 mm long root tip) was performed using the Sigma Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit. For each time point three biological replicates with material from 20 seedlings each were analyzed. The samples were homogenized in a microfuge tube for one min in lysis solution followed by vortexing, then heated (50C for 5 min in a water bath) and centrifuged (16,000 g, 4 min). The supernatant was transferred into a microfuge tube containing a lter column and centrifuged (16,000 g, 90 s). The ltrate was transferred to a binding column and centrifuged at 16,000 gfor 90 s. The ow through, as well as the solution from three successive wash steps (500 L wash buffer each), were discarded. The lter column was centrifuged to remove any remaining solution before the elution buffer was added for 1 min, followed by centrifugation (16,000 gfor 90 s). The eluant contained total RNA and was immediately put on ice. The RNA wasPlants 2022 ,11, 1191 11 of 15 quantied using a DeNovix DS-11 spectrophotometer. The total RNA was diluted with deionized DEPC water to a concentration of 100 ng L. 4.4. SPGE Probe Preparation mRNA Extraction Solid Phase Gene Extraction used 6 acupuncture needles (SEIRIN, Kyoto, Japan). Batches of 40 needles were sonicated sequentially in hexane, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min each, followed by air drying at 80C for 15 min. The needles were functionalized by incubation in a mixture of 0.25 mL (3-glycodoxypropyl) trimethoxy silane (3GTMO, SPI-Chem, West Chester, PA, USA) in 0.75 mL xylene and 10 L diisopropylethylamine in a sealed amber glass vial at 80C overnight. The needles were cooled, washed thrice with ethyl acetate, air dried for 10 min and incubated in 1 M NH2-oligo (dT)15 nucleotides in 0.1 M KOH at 37C for 6 h (four needles per 20 L solution in closed PCR tubes). The functionalized needles were rinsed thrice with deionized water (50C) for 5 min each, followed by drying at room temperature. Functionalized needles were inserted for one minute into the hypocotyl and the root tip (Figure 1) four, 11 and 48 h after reorientation. The probes were manually inserted in about 10 s intervals about one mm deep into the cortical tissue in the sequence shown in Figure 1. Hypocotyls were discarded if the probes were placed inaccurately. After 11 h, the curvature reached about 45 degrees, which resulted in stacked arrangement of the loop ends of the probes. Root tips were sampled by inserting the needle into the approximate area of the quiescent center. This approach was chosen as this tissue is not differentiated. For each time point, needles from three different seedlings were combined according to their position and considered one biological sample. Three biological samples (i.e., nine seedlings) were measured. 4.5. Reverse Transcription TwoL of oligo-dTs and RNA (10 L of total RNA or three SPGE probes) were added to a PCR tube. The tubes were heated for ve min in a Thermocycler (Hybaid, PCR Express) to 80C. A master-mix was prepared that contained 4.2 L deionized water for total RNA or 16.2 L for SPGE samples. All samples contained 2 L 10 X buffer, 0.8 L 25 mM dNTP and 1 L reverse transcriptase (nal concentrations: 1 mM dNTP , 1X reverse transcription buffer, and 50 U MultiscribeTMreverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystem high-capacity cDNA kit). This master-mix was added to RNAoligo dT mix (eight L for total RNA and 20L for SPGE) and incubated at 25C for 10 min, then at 37C for 2 h, and deactivated at 85C for 5 min. cDNA was quantied using a DeNovix DS11 spectrophotometer. 4.6. Transcript Quantication Using qPCR cDNA was diluted with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water to a concentration of 250 ng L and stored at20C. The transcripts of UBQ1, PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 were measured using qPCR with primers and their efciencies listed in Table 1. Each sample consisted of three biological and three technical replicates each. Each 10 L reaction contained 5 L 2X SYBR green PCR mastermix, 1 L primer mix (0.5 L forward 0.5 L reverse primer, 250 nM nal concentration) and 4 L of 250 ng L cDNA. qPCR was started at 95C and then cycled 40 times between 60C (60 s) and 95C (15 s) in a StepOneTM qPCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientic, Waltham, MA 02454, USA). All qPCR products were subjected to melt analysis.Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 12 of 15 Table 1. Primer information for UBQ1, PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1. The amplicon size includes the primer pairs.

Analyses The fold-changes in transcripts for different times of reorientation were referenced to UBQ using the DDCq method  72. Log-transformed data avoid skewness of small values and results in symmetrical representation of up- and downregulation of transcription 73. The ratios of Cq values of UBQ1 obtained from bottom vs. top ank or for SPGE needle 1, 2, 3 (top or left) and needle 4, 5, 6 (bottom or right) were calculated for each condition and used as reference. All Cq values, ratios, or log (2) data transformation was performed in Microsoft Excel and statistically analyzed using the ANOVA function (Excel 2019). 5. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the basal hypocotyl curvature depends on auxin medi- ated process and involves the same genes for downward or upward curvature that were found to be involved in root curvature. The expression trend for auxin related genes in positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature reverses when the hypocotyls begin to develop negative gravitropism. High resolution sampling revealed spatial variation in the transcrip- tion of auxin related genes throughout the curvature with the greatest polarity present at the most concave and convex position in the curvature.

        "introduction": "Gravitropism is dened as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-lled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplies the root graviresponse  1. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription prole of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main growth regulator in plants that affects differential elongation  2 and is the main agent in complex processes that in- cludes transport  3, and interaction with other phytohormones  46. Auxin effects depend on metabolic activity  7, cytoskeletal interaction  8,9, ions  1013, and light  1418. Auxin regulates primary and lateral root growth  19,20, branching  21, and differentiation  22. The coordinated response to the integrative effect of these factors determines the rate and degree of curvature. Therefore, differential growth responses depend on auxin-mediated processes and gene expression. Plants 2022 ,11, 1191. https:doi.org10.3390plants11091191 https:www.mdpi.comjournalplantsPlants 2022 ,11, 1191 2 of 15 Auxin is synthesized predominantly in meristematic tissue such as shoot and root apices  23, developing seeds  24 and young leaves  25 and transported away from the site of synthesis. Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the reverse fountain model  2. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA ow based on their localization in the plasma membrane  26. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specic tissues 27. PIN1 is typically present in xylem associated cells in shoots and roots  23 and is essential for efux of the auxin anion from vasculature to root apices via protophloem cells  28,29. In roots, PIN3, 4, and 7 are localized on the plasma membrane of different tiers of columella cells  30; they direct the auxin ow from columella cells to the root cortex. PIN3 and PIN7 move to the plasma membrane along the lower side of columella cells in horizontally reoriented roots  31, which results in asymmetrical auxin transport. PIN4 in the quiescent center mediates auxin efux towards the columella cells  32. The auxin sink in the root cap contributes to the asymmetric auxin distribution in reoriented roots  33. Polar localization of PIN2 in the plasma membrane of the lateral root cap and epidermal cells directs the auxin ow toward the cortical and epidermal cells  34,35. Any auxin asymmetry leads to differential growth in the elongation zone 36. In hypocotyls, sedimenting amyloplasts are found in the endodermis  37,38, which acts as gravisensing layer in dicots and is essential for the graviresponse  3941. PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis  28 and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation 42. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent  43 and a mutation in the PIN3 gene affects differential growth  42. Hence, PIN3 is an important factor for shoot graviresponse  43. The PIN3 homologs PIN4 and PIN7 are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse  43. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse  44. A mutation in ARG1 affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls  45 but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes  46. PIN1 re- localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic  47, and gravitropic response  48 and PIN1 mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) in Arabidopsis thaliana inorescence axes  49. Another Auxin Response Element promotes IAA5 , a member of AuxIAA gene family, which has been identied as one of the early and primary response genes 50,51 that are governed by auxin 52. Based on these auxin networks, we chose to compare the transcription levels of PIN1 , PIN3 ,IAA5 and ARG in vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls of Brassica rapa . Since Ubiquitin (UBQ) is highly expressed  53 and used as a reference gene  5456, its transcription level was used as a reference to assess changes in the transcription of auxin responsive genes. Despite many studies on PAT in hypocotyls and on effects of auxin on gene expression 57,58 during graviresponse  59, spatio-temporal differences in gene regu- lation during hypocotyl curvature have not been studied. Typically, total RNA is extracted by pooling the samples from the same region from several seedlings, which prevents the assessment of gene transcription at precise locations in the tissueregion under considera- tion. High spatial resolution is desirable as size, age and development is likely to affect transcription and expression proles  60. In addition, auxin-induced transcription is likely to follow a temporal prole that cannot be assessed by destructive sampling methods. We used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE)  59,61, which relies on mRNA binding to functionalized probes and allows for the repeated sampling of tissue. The temporal and spatial changes of transcription proles during the initial hypocotyl curvature indicate an auxin-based regulation of positive and negative hypocotyl curvature.Plants 2022 ,11, 1191 3 of 15 2.",
        "conclusion": "s Our results demonstrate that the basal hypocotyl curvature depends on auxin medi- ated process and involves the same genes for downward or upward curvature that were found to be involved in root curvature. The expression trend for auxin related genes in positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature reverses when the hypocotyls begin to develop negative gravitropism. High resolution sampling revealed spatial variation in the transcrip- tion of auxin related genes throughout the curvature with the greatest polarity present at the most concave and convex position in the curvature.
