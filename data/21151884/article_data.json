E-mail: Paul.BlountUTSouthwestern.edu Introduction The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL serves as a biological emergency release valve, allowing rapid loss of solutesin response to a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of a bacteriumsenvironment 1. It is perhaps the best characterized mechan- osensor 2, thus serving as a paradigm of how a membrane protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces 3.Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscLcomplex has plagued the field with debate since its inception. The original model for the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) stoichiom- etry was a homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested bycrosslinking and the study of tandem subunits 4. This model thenappeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensionalcrystallization of EcoMscL 5. But the subsequent elucidation oftheM. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) by X-ray crystallography 6 then suggested a pentameric organization, at least for thisorthologue. This result led to a re-evaluation of EcoMscL stoichiometry 6,7, which supported a pentameric organization and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystal- lization data could be fit by 5-fold as well as 6-fold symmetry.Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL wasmost likely a pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic structure of the S. aureus homolog (SaMscL) reveals a tetramer variant 8. This latter finding has again raised questions regardingthe true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiplefunctional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore,we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which shares approximately 40 sequence identity with EcoMscL andMtMscL 8, could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organi- zation resolved by X-ray crystallography. We found not only that PLoS Biology  www.plosbiology.org 1 December 2010  Volume 8  Issue 12  e1000555the true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is a pentamer but also that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly reorganizes this structure into a tetrameric stoichiometry. Results With multiple oligomeric states identified in vitro, we devised a disulfide-trapping strategy to identify the oligomeric state of MscL in bacterial membranes. Using this approach, we were able todirectly measure the subunit stoichiometry of SaMscL in vivo by generating a series of double-cysteine mutants in regions predicted to be in close proximity from both existing crystal structures(Figure 1A). These modifications allow crosslinking in the cell membrane via disulfide bonds as previously described 9,10. Briefly, the cells were osmotically shocked in the presence of theoxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline, centrifuged, and thenimmediately resuspended in SDS loading buffer to avoid unnecessary manipulation of the proteins. As we previously observed 9, osmotic shock increased disulfide bridging, presum-ably because reductants including glutathione and thioredoxin are released from the cell 11, thus decreasing the reducing potential of the cytosol. The protein content of the lysed cells was evaluatedusing SDS-PAGE and molecular weight standards. For the L10CL89C or L10CM91C SaMscL channels, we were able to observe efficient in vivo disulfide trapping (Figure 1B). For the L10CAuthor Summary The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. One of the primary ways that organisms detect forces is through mechan-osensitive channels, and mechanosensation is so vital thatessentially all organisms have at least one such sensor. Indeed, the best-studied mechanosensitive channel is from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechan-osensors from higher organisms, these channels are amodel for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. Although the bacterial mechanosensi- tive channel MscL has been well studied, the simple issueof how many subunits it has is hotly debated. There are even two published crystal structures showing either tetrameric or pentameric complexes. Here we show thatthe channel is actually pentameric in vivo and that thedetergent used to solubilize the protein can rearrange the complexes from pentamers to tetramers. The finding that detergents can have such a profound effect on structuremay have broad implications for the study of othermembrane proteins. Figure 1. S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in the cell membrane. (A) Two orientations of the SaMscL and MtMscL crystal structures are shown with the molecules viewed from the periplasmic side (top) and from the lipid bilayer (bottom). The locations of the residues used to perform the in vivodisulfide crosslinking experiments are highlighted on the structures in surface representation: blue represents L10 (SaMscL) and A10 (MtMscL), orange represents T89 (SaMscL) and T96 (MtMscL), and red represents M91 (SaMscL) and R98 (MtMscL). (B) Western blot analysis of L10CL89C and L10CM91C SaMscL channels after in vivo disulfide bond trapping using copper-phenanthroline in both osmotically shocked (S ) and non-shocked (NS) samples.doi:10.1371journal.pbio.1000555.g001S. aureus MscL Is a Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology  www.plosbiology.org 2 December 2010  Volume 8  Issue 12  e1000555L89C protein, a range of oligomeric states was observed, a pentamer being the maximal state. However, for the L10CM91C protein, one primary band was observed that reflects a pentameric complex. These data demonstrate that the pentamer is by far themajor species within the cell membrane and thus appears to be thetrue structural and functional unit in vivo. With SaMscL pentamers being the predominant oligomeric state in the cell membrane, we wanted to understand why SaMscL crystallized as a tetramer. We began by confirming the previouslyobserved pentameric and tetrameric states of MscL by performingcrosslinking experiments of purified EcoMscL and SaMscL,visualizing their oligomeric state by Western blot analysis(Figure 2). Five crosslinked EcoMscL products were observed,consistent with previous reports showing that EcoMscL is a pentamer 6,7. In contrast with previous findings 8, SaMscL also presented five crosslinked products, suggesting that SaMscL alsoexists in a pentameric oligomeric state. No difference was observedbetween proteins expressed by a high-expressing plasmid (pET) andthose encoded a moderate-expressing plasmid (pB10), demonstratingthat expressions levels have no effect on MscL oligomerization. Tosubstantiate these results, sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (SE) was performed to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel. The results for SaMscL were fit to a single-species model and yielded a molar mass of 71.2 kDa, consistent witha pentameric subunit organization (SaMscL theoretical pentamericmolar mass is 72.2 kDa) (Figure 3A, B). As a third independentmethod to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel, weperformed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scatter- ing (SEC-MALS) experiments 12. Analysis of nine independent SEC-MALS experiments resulted in an average calculated SaMscLmass of 72.8 60.8 kDa (Ave 6SD, n 9), again consistent with a pentameric subunit organization of SaMscL (representative exper-iment shown in Figure 3C).The data presented in Figures 2 and 3 show three independent approaches that all confirm the pentameric oligomeric state of SaMscL, in agreement with our in vivo crosslinking results. These data are also consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure 6,13and biochemical studies of EcoMscL 7 but inconsistent with the subunit organization in the SaMscL crystal structure 8. The major difference in the protein handling between our experiments and those previously published for the SaMscL channel 8 was the choice of solubilizing detergent. Our measurements were made in the presence of either Triton X-100 (crosslinking) or pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C 8E5) detergent (SE and SEC-MALS), not Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO), the detergent used previously to crystallize SaMscL and evaluate its oligomeric state 8. To determine if the solubilizing detergent could account for the discrepancies in the data, we tested whether LDAO may affect the oligomeric state of SaMscL. We performed SaMscL crosslinking experiments in the presence of LDAO and found essentially no crosslinked pentamer and asubstantial increase in tetramers when compared to the experi- ments performed in Triton X-100 (Figure 4A). To confirm that LDAO was altering the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel rather than simply affecting our crosslinking efficiency, we directly measured the mass of the SaMscL protein in the presence of LDAO by SEC-MALS (representative experiment shown in Figure 4B). The results show that the average protein mass inthe presence of LDAO is 60.0 62.8 kDa (Ave 6SD, n 8), a mass that is dramatically reduced compared to the C 8E5experiments (72.860.8 kDa) and that is consistent with a tetrameric oligomeric state (theoretical SaMscL tetramer is 57.8 kDa). As a third independent approach to assess the oligomeric state of the protein, we performed sedimentation velocity experiments on the SaMscL protein in LDAO. Two different methods were used to calculatethe molar mass of the protein from these data (see Methods for details). Both resulted in similar values: 62.3 61.3 kDa ( sand D method, Figure 4C) and 64 63 kDa (Stokes radius method) (Weighted Ave 61s). These results again show a protein molar mass well below that of a pentamer, consistent with LDAO affecting the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel. We also tested the reversibility of this oligomeric state reorganization by using SaMscL purified in LDAO and then exchanged the LDAO detergent for C 8E5. This protocol resulted in the SaMscL mass increasing from 61.4 60.7 kDa (Ave 6SD, n 3) to 72.0 62.6 kDa (Ave 6SD, n 4) as measured by SEC- MALS (Figure 5). The choice of initial detergent made no difference in the reversibility, as purifying SaMscL in C 8E5and then exchanging the detergent for LDAO showed a mass decreasefrom 72.2 60.5 kDa in C 8E5(Ave6SD, n 5) to 58.7 60.7 kDa in LDAO (Ave 6SD, n 3). Hence, the oligomeric rearrange- ment is reversible and is completely dependent upon the detergent solubilizing the MscL protein. Discussion Essentially all previous structural studies on MscL, as with most membrane proteins, have been performed on channels that have been solubilized, under the assumption that detergents do not alterthe subunit stoichiometry. Our data examining the effect of different detergents on the oligomeric state of SaMscL have far- reaching implications for membrane protein research, as we now clearly demonstrate that changes in oligomeric state can and do occur upon detergent solubilization, and these alterations are not easily detected by SEC (see Figures 3C and 4B). To circumvent these artifacts associated with solubilization, we have developed anin vivo cross-linking assay. Although the pentamer is by far the Figure 2. E. coli and S. aureus MscL are pentameric multimers by crosslinking. Western blot analysis of DSS-treated E. coli -MscL (Eco) and S. aureus -MscL (Sa) expressed with either the pET21a (pET) or pB10 vector show five distinct bands at both expression levels. Molecular weight markers are shown to the left of the blot and the approximatelocation of monomers (1 6) to pentamers (5 6) is shown between the blots. The right-hand blot shows a separate experiment where themajority of the EcoMscL and the SaMscL protein are in the pentamericand monomeric forms. doi:10.1371journal.pbio.1000555.g002S. aureus MscL Is a Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology  www.plosbiology.org 3 December 2010  Volume 8  Issue 12  e1000555major product observed in Figure 1B, very small amounts of smaller oligomers can be resolved upon overloading of protein gels and long Western blot exposures. The small amount of tetramers and smaller complexes observed upon long exposure could be incompletely assembled protein or may simply be due to the lackof disulfide bridging, which is rarely observed to be this efficient (e.g. see 9,10). In addition, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that oligomerization is a dynamic and even reversibleprocess in vivo. Regardless, it seems unlikely that oligomeric species smaller than pentamers have a physiological role given that there are tens of channels per cell 14, and the smaller species compose only a few percent of the total channels. Our data definitively show that the vast majority of the SaMscL channeladopts a pentameric structure in the cell membrane, consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure 6, but incompatible with the SaMscL crystal structure 8.

This result was surprising becauseseveral studies using various techniques have suggested TM1 undergoes a significant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the periplasmic side) upon channel gating. The approaches supporting this interpretation include: spin labeling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies 15, accessibility ofsulfhydryl reagents to cysteine mutants in TM1 upon gating 16,17, accessibility of heavy metals to engineered binding sites in the pore 18, suppression mutagenesis demonstrating interactions between TM1 and TM2 upon gating 19, and confirmation of multiple interaction sites between TM1 and TM2 upon gating byusing an electrostatic repulsion approach as well as disulfide trapping 10. Both the EPR studies as well as the heavy-metal binding in the pore strongly suggest that this rotation occurs quite early in the gating process, before ion permeation. By this model, V21 and G24 (V23 and G26 in EcoMscL) should rotate away Figure 5. The S. aureus MscL stoichiometry change is reversible. (A) The oligomeric state of SaMscL in 4 mM LDAO was determined using SEC-MALS, which measured a protein mass of 61.3 kDa, consistent with a tetrameric channel (top chromatogram). (B) The SaMscL-LDAO sample wasexchanged into C 8E5, and the following day the oligomeric state of SaMscL-C 8E5sample was measured by SEC-MALS. Analysis of the SEC-MALS results for the SaMscL-C 8E5sample showed a protein mass of 74.4 kDa, consistent with the channel in a pentameric state. doi:10.1371journal.pbio.1000555.g005S. aureus MscL Is a Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology  www.plosbiology.org 6 December 2010  Volume 8  Issue 12  e1000555from the pore constriction, allowing V22 and the positively charged K29 (I24 and K31 in EcoMscL) to line the open pore. The observation that this rearrangement has not occurred stronglysuggests that the crystal SaMscL structure actually reflects a strained closed state due to improper oligomeriazation, rather than an expanded intermediate state. The observed stoichiometry changes in detergents also evoke questions regarding how membrane protein subunits assemble into physiological multimeric complexes. A previous report on EcoMscL demonstrated that when the protein is translated in vitro in the absence of any lipid or detergent and is subsequentlypurified in the presence of Triton X-100, the channel spontane- ously assembles into pentamers 20. A separate study demon- strated that even synthetically synthesized EcoMscL will oligomer-ize into functional channels when incorporated into lipid membranes 21. These studies demonstrate that the EcoMscL channel has the ability to self-assemble into the functionaloligomer in vitro. Similarly, it appears that C 8E5and Triton X-100 allow SaMscL to properly fold and assemble into a pentameric structure, which correlates with the observed oligo-meric state in vivo. In contrast, LDAO reorganizes SaMscL into tetramers that do not appear to exist in significant quantities in vivo, suggesting that they are not physiologically relevant. Theobserved self-assembly properties of EcoMscL under many conditions, combined with the reversible nature of the detergent- induced oligomeric state changes for SaMscL, may explain whyLiu et al. observed channel function for the LDAO solubilized SaMscL tetramers 8; presumably, once the tetrameric LDAO- solubilized SaMscL is reconstituted into lipids, it rearranges backinto functional pentameric structures. The crystal structure of the SaMscL was derived from a truncation mutant in which several amino acids at the C-terminus had been removed 8. One previous study suggested that at least some C-terminus deletions of EcoMscL could lead to the formationof larger aggregates when translated in a cell-free system 22. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the SaMscL deletion contributed to the stabilization of the tetramer in the crystal, ourdata do demonstrate that detergents alone can stabilize alternative oligomeric states of the full-length SaMscL in solution. Our observations make it tempting to speculate that larger, more hydrated head groups (i.e. the head groups of C 8E5and Triton X-100) promote pentamer formation, while smaller head groups (i.e. LDAO) promote tetramer formation. However, withsuch a small number of detergents tested thus far, additional experiments will be required to identify what chemical properties of the detergents cause the oligomeric state change and what effect, if any, lipids may have on the stabilization of specific oligomeric states. In sum, our data demonstrate that the physiologically active SaMscL oligomer in vivo is a pentamer and that purification in detergents can cause a reorganization of the SaMscL channelsoligomeric state. Our findings also show that SEC alone is insufficient to evaluate the usefulness of a particular detergent for the study of membrane proteins; ideally, SEC-MALS andoranalytical ultracentrifugation should be correlated with in vivo experiments that can more confidently determine the functional and physiologically relevant oligomeric state of membrane proteins. Materials and Methods Purification SaMscL (accession number: CAG43065) was expressed using the pET21a vector in PB116 E. coli cells grown to O.D. 6000.60.8 and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 23 h at 37 uC. Cells were harvestedand stored at 280uC until needed. Cells containing SaMscL were lysed in 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mgml DNAse, 1 mgml lysozyme, and 150 ml protease inhibitors (Sigma) using a French press at 16K PSI at 4 uC. The cell lysate was incubated with 40 mM n-Decyl- b-D-Maltopyranoside (DM) for 1 h at 4 uCa n d then centrifuged at 24,000 6g for 30 min at 4 uC to clarify the lysate. 4 mM imidazol was added to the resulting supernatant and then bound to 4 ml of Ni-NTA slury pre-equilibrated with 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazol, and 40 mM DM for 1 h at 4 uC. Standard metal affinity chromatography was performed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mM NaPipH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazol, 4 mM DM, and SaMscL was eluted with 50 mM NaPi pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazol, and 4 mM DM. The purest protein fractions were combined and concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon). Detergent exchange was accomplished by adding 40 mM Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) or 5 (wv) pen- taethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C 8E5) to the concentrated SaMscL and allowing the protein-detergent complex to equilibrate overnight at room temperature. The following day the protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl, and 4 mM LDAO or 0.5 (wv) C 8E5. The eluting peak was collected and concentrated using a 50,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon) and used for either sedimentation equilibrium experiments or size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering experiments (SEC-MALS). Crosslinking SaMscL and EcoMscL were cloned into pB10 and pET21a vectors and transformed into PB104 or PB116 E. coli and purified as previously described 10. 2 Triton X-100 or 44 mM LDAO was used for MscL extraction with a final concentration of 0.2 and 2.1 mM, respectively, after purification. For crosslinking reactions 5 mg of protein was incubated with 2 mM DSS (Thermo Scientific) on ice for 5 min. The reaction was quenched with a final concentration of 100 mM Tris pH 7.5 for 15 min at room temperature as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples werebrought up in non-reducing sample buffer, were loaded on a Criterion 420 gel, and were subjected to Western as previously described 10. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at 1:4,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio- Rad) at 1:100,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film. In Vivo Disulfide Trapping Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37 uCi n LB. LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl LB) or shocked (water with 1.5 mMc o p p e r phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 15 min at 37 uC. Samples were spun down at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately re- suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a 420 gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis 10. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at 1:4,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) at 1:40,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film.

The lightS. aureus MscL Is a Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology  www.plosbiology.org 7 December 2010  Volume 8  Issue 12  e1000555scattering and refractive index instruments were calibrated following the manufacturers guidelines, and 40 ml of runningbuffer (20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl and 4 mM LDAO or0.5 (wv) C 8E5) was used to equilibrate the SEC column and establish stable baselines for the light scattering and refractive index instruments. 2575 mg of purified protein was used for each SEC- MALS experiment, and data were collected using ASTRA Vsoftware (Wyatt Technologies) and processed following the manufacturers guidelines. LDAO and C 8E5dndc values (0.1490 and 0.1240, respectively) were measured using the Optilab rEXfollowing the manufacturers guidelines and the SaMscL extinctioncoefficient was calculated from the amino acid sequence. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Buffer density-matching experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge to identify the appropriate solution density to match the density of the C 8E5 detergent. Volumes of 180 mL of solutions containing 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 0.5 (wv) C 8E5, and various concentrations of NaCl were placed in the sample sector of a dual-sectored, charcoal-filled Epon centerpiece (Beckman-Coulter; all AUC experiments were carriedout in such centerpieces) that was sandwiched between sapphirewindows. Identical buffers without detergent were placed in the reference sector. The centrifugation cells were centrifuged at a temperature of 25 uC and a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm; an An-50Ti rotor was used for all centrifugation experiments. The formation ofany detergent concentration gradient was monitored using interference optics. C 8E5was found to be neutrally buoyant in 20 mM NaPi pH 7.5, 170 mM NaCl, which was then used for allsedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments with 0.5C 8E5at 25 uC. 4, 8, 40, and 80 mM SaMscL samples were prepared and loaded into the assembled ultracentrifuge cells; buffer with detergent was deposited in the reference sector. Long solutioncolumns (180 mL) were also used in this experiment. Centrifugation was performed at 25 uC at 9,500, 14,000, and 17,500 rpm. The data were analyzed using SEDFIT to determine if the samples had come to equilibrium, and SEDPHAT 23 was used to fit the sedimentation equilibrium data to a single species model.Multispeed analysis with mass-conservation constraints was per-formed, allowing the time-invariant and radially invariant noise elements to be calculated and subtracted from the data 23. A 68.3 confidence interval was calculated as previously described24,25. The error number reported is the average of the positiveand negative deviations from best mass value. For the determination of the amount of detergent bound per gram of protein ( d D), buffer without detergent was used in the reference sector, and two differentconcentrations (41 and 66 mM) of MscL were placed in the sample sector. The volume of each sample and reference was 390 ml. The rotor speed used was 50,000 rpm, and the temperature setting was 20uC. The data were analyzed in SEDFIT using the non-interacting discrete species model 26,27. The flotation of the detergentmicelles (the density of LDAO is less than that of water) was explicitly accounted for by giving that species a negative sedimentation coefficient. The amounts of absorbance units andinterference fringes present for the main sedimenting species werederived from this analysis. Using the calculated extinction coefficient of the protein and the known refractive index increments of the detergent and the protein, d Dwas calculated as in le Maire et al. 28. Subsequent sedimentation velocity experiments wereperformed with 20, 32, and 64 mM SaMscL samples in 4 mM LDAO at 50,000 rpm at 20 uC. The volume centrifuged was 390mL. In these cases, the reference buffer contained the same LDAO as the sample. The absorbance data (interference datawere not collected) were initially analyzed using the c(s) model inSEDFIT 26. Although LDAO has a very low extinction coefficient at 280 nm, its floatation was detectable; the range of data near tothe meniscus was therefore eliminated for this analysis. In theseanalyses, small quantities (23 of the total signal) of large specieswere detected. Using this information, all species, including thefloating detergent, were modeled in the species analysis model inSEDPHAT 26. This approach is referred to as the  sand D method in the text, because both the sedimentation coefficient andthe diffusion coefficient are refined to arrive at the buoyant molarmass ( M b).Mbwas transformed to M(the molar mass of the protein) using the formula MMb 1w0rC0C1 , 1 where 1Q0r 1C22vvPr  zdD1C22vvDr  : 2 29 The symbol ris the solution density, C22vvPis the partial specific volume of the protein, and C22vvDis the partial specific volume of the detergent. Any lipids bound to SaMscL were neglected in thesecalculations. M bwas also calculated using the relationship Mb6pN0gRss, 3 where N0is Avogadros number, gis the solution viscosity, Rsis the Stokes radius of the proteindetergent complex, and sis the sedimentation coefficient. The Stokes radius of the protein wasobtained by calibrating the SEC column described above withproteins of known Stokes radius. R sfor SaMscL in LDAO was 4.2 nm. Again, Mbwas transformed to Musing Eq. 1. Values for C22vvP,g, and rwere estimated using the program SEDNTERP 30. The value of C22vvDwas taken as 1.13 mLg 31. Confidence intervals of sand Mbwere calculated as detailed above. A confidence interval for the value of Stokes radius, which wasderived from a linear regression, was: R sta2ss  1z1 nzVeC22VVe 2 SVVs , where tis the tstatistic, ssis the estimate of sfor the regression line, Veis the elution volume of MscL from the SEC column, C22VVeis the average elution volume of the standards, nis the number of standards, and SVVis the sum of squared deviations of the individual standard compared to C22VVe. In cases of asymmetric error intervals, the swas taken as the average of the difference between the boundary value and the best-fitted value. Because multipleexperiments, each having different errors, were performed, the value of Mreported in the main text is the weighted mean m w6 the weighted s(sw), calculated using the formulas: mwP iMi:1 s2 iP i1 s2 i, and sw1P i1 s2 i for the Iexperiments preformed ( i 3 in this case).S. aureus MscL Is a Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology  www.plosbiology.org 8 December 2010  Volume 8  Issue 12  e1000555Acknowledgments The authors thank Christina Eaton and Drs.

        "introduction": "The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL serves as a biological emergency release valve, allowing rapid loss of solutesin response to a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of a bacteriumsenvironment 1. It is perhaps the best characterized mechan- osensor 2, thus serving as a paradigm of how a membrane protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces 3.Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscLcomplex has plagued the field with debate since its inception. The original model for the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) stoichiom- etry was a homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested bycrosslinking and the study of tandem subunits 4. This model thenappeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensionalcrystallization of EcoMscL 5. But the subsequent elucidation oftheM. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) by X-ray crystallography 6 then suggested a pentameric organization, at least for thisorthologue. This result led to a re-evaluation of EcoMscL stoichiometry 6,7, which supported a pentameric organization and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystal- lization data could be fit by 5-fold as well as 6-fold symmetry.Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL wasmost likely a pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic structure of the S. aureus homolog (SaMscL) reveals a tetramer variant 8. This latter finding has again raised questions regardingthe true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiplefunctional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore,we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which shares approximately 40 sequence identity with EcoMscL andMtMscL 8, could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organi- zation resolved by X-ray crystallography. We found not only that PLoS Biology  www.plosbiology.org 1 December 2010  Volume 8  Issue 12  e1000555the true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is a pentamer but also that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly reorganizes this structure into a tetrameric stoichiometry.",
