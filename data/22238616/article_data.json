E-mail: melha.mellataasu.edu Introduction Escherichia coli are versatile bacteria; with the majority being non-pathogenic and considered as commensals. A subset of thesebacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer anability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum ofintestinal and extra-intestinal diseases 1,2. One of the importantaspects of the fitness of E. coli is thought to be its ability to survive and persist in a variety of environments, including variedanatomical niches, food, soils, poultry litter, and acidic conditions.Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) cause infections outside of their normal intestinal habitat in both mammals and birds,resulting in a considerable economic and public health burden3,4. Major infections associated with ExPEC in humans includeurinary tract infections (UTI), newborn meningitis (NBM) andsepticemia 4. In birds, a subgroup of ExPEC, named Avian Pathogenic E. coli (APEC), causes a complex of systemic infections,mainly respiratory, often leading to death 4. The genetic relationship between APEC and other ExPEC of human and animal origin 4 emphasizes the potential zoonotic risk of avian-derived E. coli strains. In poultry, isolates associated with fecal matter, environmental contamination and chicken meat products possess virulence gene profiles similar to those causing human outbreaks 5,6, which suggests that retail chicken may be an important reservoir for E. coli causing ExPEC infections in humans. ExPEC exhibit a high degree of antigenic and genetic diversity, which complicates their diagnosis and the design of cross- protective vaccines 7. ExPEC are defined by a limited number of O-antigens, with specific O antigens being associated withcertain clinical syndromes. For example, E. coli from a small number of O serogroups (O4, O6, O14, O22, O75, and O83) cause 75 of urinary tract infections 8 and a limited number ofserotypes, principally O1, O2, O78, O8, and O35, are commonly PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 January 2012  Volume 7  Issue 1  e29481implicated in avian colibacillosis 9, suggesting that not all O polysaccharides have identical virulence properties 10,11. The possession of multiple large plasmids is often a defining feature of ExPEC, especially APEC, in which the virulence is partly plasmid-mediated 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Although many studies have been dedicated to understanding the pathogenesis of ExPEC, little is known about the mechanismsof their persistence. Since a correlation between the ecology ofbacteria and their virulence exists, understanding the mechanismsof fitness and survival of these bacteria in extreme and changingconditions would not only improve our understanding of theirpersistence, but also will contribute to better design strategies for their prevention and treatments. Previously, the model APEC strain x7122 (O78:K80:H9), containing three large plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3, previously named pAPEC-1, pAPEC-2, and pAPEC-3 respectively, and a cryptic plasmid pChi7122-4 (Table 1), hasbeen used to undestand the role of large plasmids in the virulenceof ExPEC 12. Specifically, we determined that both the nature ofplasmids and their combinations have an effect on the virulenceand the genetic diversity of ExPEC. Although we have clearlydetermined that pChi7122-1 has a major role in systemic infectionof APEC in chickens, the role of the remaining plasmids remained unclear. Since pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 do not encode for common ExPEC virulence factors 12, and their roles are considered asminor in systemic infection in chickens 12, we hypothesized thatthese plasmids could be important in persistence of this bacterialstrain in different stressful conditions encountered before and during infections. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) fully sequence and analyze the DNA of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 of APEC strain x7122; and (2) evaluate the contribution of these plasmids, as well the plasmid pChi7122-1,either individually or in combination, in the bacterial interaction with a model human intestinal epithelial cell line, bile and acid resistance, biofilm formation, and growth in iron-restricted medium and in the presence of different carbon sources. Moreover, since the plasmids can be carried by strains with different backgrounds, we aimed to determine the effect of different host strain backgrounds on plasmid-associated pheno- types. This study presents for the first time the sequence of three plasmids of APEC strain x7122 and provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms that ExPEC may use for their persistence and survival in stressful conditions. Results and Discussion Genome sequencing has made major contributions to our knowledge of virulence and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids 20; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIBFIIA backbone. Although PCR characterization of UPEC and APEC plasmids has revealed the presence of plasmids from other Inc groups 21, studies on their role in ExPEC has been limited. Previously, we examined the role of the three large plasmids of APEC x7122 in pathogenesis in chickens 12 and Table 1. Strains and plasmids used in this study.

We were able to assign roles for pChi7122-1 in the virulence in systemic infection ofbacteria; however the roles of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 inAPEC x7122 were equivocal. General sequence features of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 In this study, we present the whole DNA sequences of plasmids pChi7122-2 (FR851303), pChi7122-3 (FR851304) and pChi7122-4 (FR851305). The general sequence features of the three plasmidsare listed in the Table 2. Plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3 and pChi7122-4 consist of 82,676 bp, 56,676 bp and 4,300 bp respectively (Fig. 1, Table 2)and are predicted to encode 115, 86, and 3 coding sequences(CDS) respectively (Table 2, Table S1 and S2); these CDSs include the complete sequences for the iron acquisition system eitABCD on pChi7122-2 and type IV fimbriae on pChi7122-3, which havebeen previously shown to be present on these plasmids by PCR12. Analysis of pChi7122-4 revealed 3 CDSs that were predictedto encode plasmid replication and maintenance functions only(Table 2, Fig. 1); consequently we excluded this plasmid from all further experimental analysis. We assessed the presence of eitAgene of pChi7122-2 and two genes of pChi7122-3 ( pilS and pilV) by PCR among 225 pathogenic E. coli strains from different origins, including 100 human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI), 80 APEC, and 45 humanenteric pathogenic E. coli . PCR results show that eitAwas present in 10 of non-UTI human isolates and 5 of APEC strains, butwas absent in other groups. The genes pilSand pilVof pChi7122-3 were detected in 8.75 of the APEC group and in 10 of human UTI isolates, respectively. The low prevalence of pChi7122-2 ( eitA) and pChi7122-3 ( pilSand pilV) genes among other ExPEC of human and avian origin, as determined by PCR, could indicatethe recent acquisition of these genes by these E. coli strains, enabling them to inhabit new niches. Our past work has determined that plasmids pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 are self-conjugative 12. Herein, their sequencesanalysis has revealed the presence of genes required for their transfer (Fig. 1, Table S1 and S2). The transfer region of pChi7122-2 is about 34 kb consisting of 24 traand 9 trbgenes (Table S1) and is identical to the one of the virulence plasmid pAA(FN554767.1; 99 identity with 92 coverage), whereas the tra region of pChi7122-3 has the same organization as its equivalentinE. coli conjugative plasmid IncI2 R721 (AP002527.1); it contains 11tratrb genes, grouped in two clusters separated by two pilgenes (Fig. 1, Table S2). pChi7122-3 also harbors genes nikB,nikC, andnikA for relaxome formation involved in plasmid transfer 22,23 (Fig. 1, Table S2). Among the three plasmids, only pChi7122-2 carries antibiotic resistance genes (MM2-101, MM2-102 and MM2-103) (Table S1). These genes encode for a dihydropteroate synthase ( sul1) 24, a GCN5-related N-acetyl transferase 25 and a streptomycin 3 9- adenylytransferase (SP-R) ( aadA) 26, respectively. The pheno- typic expression of streptomycin and sulfonamide (trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole) resistance in strains containing pChi7122-2 has been determined by disk diffusion tests. Although streptomycin has only limited current usage in clinical medicine, it remains important for therapy of, and growth promotion in, animals and bacterial disease control in plants 27. It was suggested thatsulphonamide resistance genes can be transferred from commensal bacteria via integrons, transposons or plasmids, into more virulent bacteria in the intestine 28. Comparative analysis of the pChi7122 plasmids with those in the public databases using BLASTn showed that pChi7122-2shares high homology with plasmids from Shigella sonnei (pEG356), an urinary E. coli isolate (pHK01), EAEC (pAA), and K. pneumoniae (pKF3-70), respectively (with 100 identity and 70 coverage).The pChi7122-3 genome has shown homology with only one plasmid, the E. coli plasmid R721 (with 99 identity and 90 coverage), which includes the type IV fimbriae piloperon 29,30 and shufflon 31,32. Mauve alignment of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 with their respective homologous plasmids confirmedthese homologies (Fig. S1). The plasmid pChi7122-2 and its homologous plasmids have a 4 kb region in common, which encodes for the ABC iron uptake locus eitABCD (Fig. 2A), previously described in two other APEC plasmids, pAPEC-O2-ColV 17 and pAPEC-O1-ColBM 15. ADNA comparison of the regions of eitABCD of the six plasmids has shown that with the exception of pAPEC-O2-ColV, this region is located downstream of the parregion of plasmids and is flanked by the transposon tnpA gene in pChi7122-2, pHK01, and pEG356 respectively and by an insertion sequence IS629 in pAPEC-O1- ColBM (Fig. 2A) which could explain the dissemination of eitABCD among genomes of these bacteria. We were unable to detect the iron-uptake phenotype expression of eitABCD genes using CAS agar medium 12, even though it was efficient in revealing those of pChi7122-1 and chromosomally-encoded systems. Therefore in this study, we extended the analysis by testing the growth ofstrains, with and without the three plasmids, in iron-limited medium alone or supplemented with either FeSO 4, heme or hemoglobin. Our results show that only pChi7122-1 increased the growth of strains in iron-sequestered environments (Fig. S2). The ability to acquire iron from heme and hemoglobin could be related Table 2.

Future studies are needed to determine conditions of expression of eitABCD , such as under in vivo conditions. New putative sugar utilization pathways identified in pChi7122-2 An important aspect of pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to adapt their metabolism to the available nutrients by coordinatingtheir metabolism with their life cycle 35. Recent reports have shown that in the intestine, both commensal and enterohemor- rhagic E. coli (EHEC) require multiple carbon metabolic pathways 36,37. In this study, DNA sequence analysis of pChi7122-2 has revealed the presence of two systems of sugar utilization pathways.This system, with two divergent operons, consists of a gene for a starvation-sensing protein ( pChiA ) located in the opposite orienta- tion to four successive genes pChiOTDR (Fig. 2B, 3). These genes have no significant homology with DNA sequences of other E. coli available on public databases, as determined by MegaBLASTn search analysis, but share 94 homology (with 100 coverage) with the chromosomal DNA sequence of genomes of Salmonella Enteritidis (AM933172.1), Gallinarum (AM933173.1), Weltevre-den (FR775220.1) and Agona (CP001138.1), respectively (Fig. 2B). The sequence analysis of this region in these Salmonella serovars has determined that, with the exception of S. Agona, in which the pChiA -equivalent gene is truncated, the organization of the pChiOTDR homologous genes in the genome of the four pathogens is the same (Fig. 2B). The identities of the proteins translated bythese genes were between 8699 (Fig. 2B, Table S3, and Fig.S3). The putative functions and the predicted 3-D structures of the pChiA and pChiOTDR gene products, determined by Blast-PSI and HHpred 38, show that pChiA encodes for a bifunctional dehydratase that utilizes both D-mannonate and D-altronate as substrates 39 and pChiOTDR encode for a gluconate 5- dehydrogenase, pChiO; an exonate sugar transport, pChiT; an L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiD; and a regulator proteinGntR-like, pChiR, respectively (Table S3, Fig. 3A). Two promoter regions, P pChiA and P pChi, with independent cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding boxes 40,41, were detected in the promoter region of pChiA and pChiO (Fig. 3B). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR is a putative transcriptional regulator from GntR family 42. In the absence of glucose, the preferred carbon source for E. coli , the CRP would activate the pChi7122-2 sugars pathways 40,41; whereas pChiR would have an opposite effect. It is known that colonic mucus contains severalsugar acids that represent an important source of nutrients and that genes involved in the catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, glucosamine, gluconate, arabinose, and fucose areexpressed in both commensal E. coli and EHEC 36. It has also been reported that UPEC bacteria grown in urine express enzymes for catabolism of sialic acid, gluconate, xylose, andarabinose 43 and genes involved in the transport of gluconate and related hexonates are up-regulated in S.Typhimurium in macrophages 44, suggesting that the new pChi7122-2 sugar pathways could also be important either in the pathogenesis of APEC, as well as in Salmonella serovars Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Weltevreden and Agona or in their persistence in different hosts. Compared to the chromosomal E. coli K-12 L-idonic acid pathway encoded by the gnTII genes, idnK idnDOTR 45, the genes of the operon pChiOTDR of pChi7122-2 have no significant homologies at the DNA level and share some sequence identity at the protein level (Table 3); moreover, the position of the gene of L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase is different in the two distinct gene clusters. Intriguingly, the gluconate kinase gene, idnK, of GnTII pathway 45 is absent in the pChi7122-2 pathway and is substituted by the gene of the starvation sensing protein, rspA-like 46 pChiA which is essential for survival of bacteria in limited nutrient conditions. The gene encoding the regulatory protein GntR in the GnTII pathways, exhibits no significant homology at both DNA and protein levels with its counterpart in pChi7122-2(pChiR ) (Table 3). In this study, although we have shown that strains have better growth in media with glucoronic acid than with other sugars tested (Fig. S4), there were no significant differencesbetween strains with and without the plasmid pChi7122-2.

Future studies will be conductedto determine the conditions of their expression and their eventualrole in both APEC and Salmonella serovars. Diversity of plasmids-associated fitness phenotypes and the effect of host strain background on their expression The genomic diversity among ExPEC isolates has been described and multiple factors have been linked to their virulence48,49. However, a systematic analysis of ExPEC phenotypicdiversity has not been done previously. In this study, the largeplasmids-associated phenotypes related to fitness of ExPEC bacteria as well the effect of host strain backgrounds were investigated. Intestines are suspected to be a primary reservoir of ExPEC strains causing diseases in both humans 50 and chickens 5. To determine if large plasmids would increase the fitness of their carriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract environment, we assessedthe ability of strains to colonize intestine cells and resist both acidand bile, attributes that allow enteric bacteria to live and persist inthe intestine of their host 51. APEC strain x7122 associates with and invades into intestinal epithelial cells without affecting the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1. Some APEC strains are genetically similar to human ExPEC, especially to uropathogenicE. coli (UPEC) 52, and could cause human diseases 53. Herein, we investigated the ability of APEC-derivative strains to associatewith, and invade into, human cells of the kind that may be targeted by human ExPEC bacteria during their commensal life cycle in the intestine. The intestine is suspected to be a reservoir ofExPEC that cause infections in humans 50. Since APEC strainsare now considered as potential food-borne pathogens that couldbe transmitted to humans via poultry products 4,6,28, we aimedto investigate the interaction of APEC-derivative strains with 3-Dorganotypic models of human intestinal epithelial cells. The 3-D model of intestinal epithelium used in this study has been shown previously to mimic the in vivo parental tissue more closely thanmonolayer cultures with regard to morphology and function 54.The highly differentiated character of the 3-D intestinal cells isreflected in the presence of distinct apical and basolateral polarity,increased expression and better organization of tight junctions, extracellular matrix, and brush border proteins, highly localized expression of mucins, and multiple epithelial cell types relevant tothose found in vivo 55. Our data showed that APEC-derivativestrains were able to associate with, and invade into, humanintestinal epithelial cells, and large plasmids did not havesignificant effect on these characteristics (Fig. 4). Although tightjunctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures aspart of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration,or other consequences such as diarrhea. In this study, evaluation ofdifferent APEC-derivative strains for their interaction with 3-Dhuman intestinal epithelial cells, showed that although these strains attached and invaded into these cells, they did not disturbtheir tight junctions, based on immunofluorescence evaluation (Fig. 4). These data suggest that invasion of the intestine anddissemination would not occur through intercellular transportation of the bacteria, which could potentially disseminate through transcellular transportation, a mechanism used by meningitis-causing bacteria, including E. coli K1 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) 56. These bacteriacould live as commensals in the intestines from where they shedand cause diseases in different hosts or other sites of the same host. Role of plasmids in bile and acid resistance. Mechanisms associated with bile resistance in bacteria are LPS synthesis,expression of efflux pump genes and regulatory genes such asmarAB and phoPQ 51. In this study, we have shown that all wild- type derived strains tested were resistant to deoxycholate (DOC), one of the most abundant bile salts in humans (data not shown);whereas the group of strains derived from E. coli K-12 behaved differently (Fig. 5A). Although, E. coli K-12 was sensitive to the bile, its plasmid derivative strains x7346 (pChi7122-1) and x7347 (pChi7122-2) had increased survival in LB agar media with 1 (wv) DOC as compared to their parent x6092. The strain x7348 (pChi7122-3) was as sensitive to bile as its parent strain x6092 (Fig. 5A). According to our results APEC x7122 strain better tolerates the presence of bile salts in the media then E. coli K-12 which was sensitive to the detergent (Fig. 5, data of wild-type notshown). The mechanism of resistance of APEC could be both LPSand plasmid related. In fact, the detection of plasmid-associated resistance in E. coli K-12 background but not in the wild-type background strains, could be related to the presence of otherfactors, including the LPS in these strains that has masked theeffect of plasmids on this phenomenon; this statement is supportedby the resistance of the rough mutant which is usuallyhypersensitive to bile 57. The mechanism of resistanceencoded by the plasmid pChi7122-1 could be associated with proteins such as OmpT that was previously associated with bile resistance in Vibrio cholerae 58 and ABC transport proteins that are known to play a role in the protection of cells from toxiccompounds 59. Since such factors are not located on pChi7122-2, other factors predicted to be encoded by this plasmid, such asTA modules could be involved in bile tolerance of bacteria; as TA systems are now known to play an important role in bacterial stress physiology 60,61,62. To our knowledge, this is the first time thatplasmids have been shown to be associated with the bile resistanceofE. coli . Acid resistance is important for bacterial survival in acidic stomach or in foods with low pH 63. Our results have shown that plasmids do not have any effect on the growth of the wild-typederived strains when grown in acidic medium for a short period(12 hours), as the strains with and without plasmids grew similarly(data not shown). However, at longer incubation times (18 hours),strains behaved differently (Fig. 5B). Similar to the study by Lim et al. 64 on the plasmid pO157 in E. coli O157, we have shown that in the absence of its three plasmids, the APEC strain survived better in acidic conditions than in their presence when incubatedfor 18 h. Moreover, our study showed that although the plasmidpChi7122-1, either alone or in combination with pChi7122-2 orpChi7122-3, decreased the acid tolerance of bacteria, the presenceof pChi7122-3 had the opposite effect (Fig. 5B). Since pChi7122-1 and pO157 play a major role in the virulence of APEC 12 and E.Figure 2. Comparison of physical and genetic maps for eitABCD and sugar pathway regions.

Elucidation of the mechanism of acid tolerance associated with pChi7122-3 isneeded to fully understanding the persistence of E. coli in acidic conditions. Figure 3.

Large plasmids increase biofilm formation at host temperatures. Bacterial biofilm formation is a major concern in both medical and industrial systems. Biofilm formation isassociated with many medically-important pathogenic bacteria, asan estimated 65-80 of all human infections are thought to bebiofilm-related 66. However, elucidating the mechanisms ofbiofilm formation necessary for establishing strategies for theirprevention and treatments is becoming a matter of urgency. ExPEC cells are found in biofilm-like communities in both gastrointestinal 67 and urinary tracts 68 indicating theimportance of biofilms in the persistence of these bacteria. ExPECbacteria have to adapt to extreme temperature changes. In thisstudy, our strategy using three large plasmids, either individually orin combination in both an APEC wild-type and an E. coli K-12 background, and different O-LPS at different temperatures, hasrevealed new insights into biofilm formation of ExPEC. Altogether,our data distinguished four groups of factor-driven biofilms,including plasmidless-, plasmid-, O-LPS-, and rough LPS-mediatedbiofilms in E. coli which differ in their expression conditions. In general, the different strains tested formed more biofilms at 30uC than at 37 uCo r4 2 uC (Fig. 6A). Compared to the wild-type, the plasmidless strain produced significantly more biofilm at 30 uC (P,0.05) (Fig. 6A). In the same conditions, the presence of the three plasmids, either individually or in combinations in thestrains, reduced the level of biofilm formation to the level of thewild-type strain (Fig. 6A). In contrary, at host temperatures (37 u and 42 u) (Fig. 6A), the plasmidless strain produced less biofilm than the wild-type strain, with the data being statisticallysignificant ( P,0.05) at 42 uC (Fig. 6A). The biofilm formed by the plasmid-cured strain, highly produced at 30 uC (Fig. 6A), is probably promoted by no-plasmidicfactors preferentially expressed at 30 uC and at early stage of biofilm formation; among them curli required for development ofbiofilm and adhesion 69. Expression of biofilm in theenvironment (30 uC) would be beneficial for plasmidless strains; in these conditions, biofilm will allow these bacteria to be in closeproximity with other bacterial species and acquire transmissiblegenetic elements. It has been shown that conjugative plasmids promote bacterial biofilm formation by generating F-pili mating pairs, which isimportant for early biofilm formation 70,71,72. In this report, wehave shown that plasmid-driven biofilms are very complex and thiscomplexity is related to the nature of the plasmids, theircombinations, host strain backgrounds, and the temperature towhich the strains are exposed. The presence of the three plasmidspChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in the wild-type strain(Fig. 6A) and pChi7122-3 in the E. coli K-12 strain (Fig. 6B), had increased biofilm formation at host temperature conditions, withdata being significant at 42 uC(P,0.05) (Fig. 6B). The fact that pChi7122-3-driven enhancement of bacterial biofilm was higherthan those of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-1 in both wild-type andtheE. coli K-12 backgrounds could be related to not only the tra genes expression 70,71,72 but also to the type IV fimbriaeencoded by pChi7122-3, which was previously associated with thebiofilm formation in enteroaggregative E. coli 73. Plasmid-driven biofilms could be essential in the virulence process by givingbacteria a survival advantage in different niches of the host, whichcould result in disease. A controversy exists regarding the role of LPS in bacterial biofilm formation 74,75. In this study, we have shown that thethree plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in wild-type derivative strains with different O-LPS backgrounds behaveddifferently in their biofilm formation (Fig. 6C). In absence of O78-LPS, the rough strain produced significantly ( P,0.0001) less biofilm than its smooth wild-type strain at 30 uC. Even though substitution of O78-LPS with O111-LPS had little effect on Figure 5. Bile and acid tolerance of strains.

Since the O1-LPS-driven enhancement of bacteria biofilm occurs at 30 uC condition and is repressed at host temperatures (37uC42 uC), this indicates that its role could be more important in the persistence of bacteria in the environment, and that thetemperature of 30 uC in early O1-LPS-associated biofilm forma- tion is necessary. The fact that O1-LPS-driven biofilm is nothighly formed at 37 uC and 42 uC (Fig. 6C), could be related to a change in the LPS-O1 bilayer structure at higher temperature76,77,78 leading to the disturbance of the early biofilm formed.To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of the natureof LPS on biofilm formation. Conclusion A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in other E. coli strains but found in Salmonella serovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriae piloperon were located on pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 respectively. Multipleplasmid-encoded mechanisms, including toxin-antitoxin modulesand the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness andpersistence of APEC x7122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2) when present in E. coli K-12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122-3) in the wild-type background. Four differentfactor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, rough-LPS-,and O-LPS-mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor-driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could havedistinct functions. Some of them could be important in theacquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in theenvironment; others could be involved in virulence. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid-derivative strains of an ExPECmodel strain x7122 (O78:K80:H9) revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity. Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions Most of the bacterial strains used in this study, listed in Table 1, are derived from the highly virulent APEC strain x7122 (O78:K80:H9) 79 and were fully described in our previous studies 10,12,80. To evaluate the effect of the host strain background on plasmid- associated phenotypes, we used three derivatives of x7122 with different LPS profiles containing the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3; a rough mutant strain (O78-) ofAPEC x7122, x7145; and two derivatives of x7145, x7167 and x7193, which respectively express O111 and O1 antigens rather than the native O78 antigen. We also used strains derived from an E. coli K-12, x6092, containing either pChi7122-1, x7346; pChi7122-2, x7347; or pChi7122-3, x7348 (Table 1, 10,12,80). Antibiotic susceptibility testing of strains was performed and interpreted via disk diffusion method, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 81,82. A collection of one hundred human strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI) 19, eighty APEC strains, and forty-five enteric E. coli strains (from our collection) were used to study the distribution ofpChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3-associated genes among differentgroups of pathogenic E. coli by PCR.

Strains were stored as stock cultures at 280uCi n peptone-glycerol medium. All wild-type derivative strains grew similarly in LB and reached the OD 600,1.0 when incubated overnight (ON) at 37 uC standing, except the strain x7561 (pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2) which had a slightly lower growth and its OD 600was around 0.8 when grown in the same conditions. Plasmid sequencing and annotation The DNA sequences of pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3 and pChi7122-4 plasmids were derived from contig sequences of the whole genomic DNA of APEC x7122. The sequences were manipulated to the standard of an Improved High-Quality Draft 83. The program Artemis 84 was used to identify the plasmids and collate data. For each of the three plasmids all the sequencegaps were closed by directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the products sequenced with big dye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 capillary sequencers. All the plasmids were circularized and contiguated using this method. The DNA sequences were annotated to identify coding sequences and repeat sequences in Artemis and the vector NTI suite of programs was used to confirm the previous analysis. To identify plasmids with similar sequences, pChi7122-2 (FR851303)and pChi7122-3 (FR851304) were compared by BLASTn at NCBI. Plasmid sequences of pEG356 (FN594520.1) from Shigella sonnei , pHK01 (HM355591.1) from a urinary E. coli isolate, pAA (FN554767.1) from EAEC, and pKF3-70 (FJ494913.1) from K. pneumoniae , and R721 (AP002527.1) a trimethoprim and strepto- mycin resistant plasmid from an E. coli were downloaded. Plasmid sequences were aligned and then visualized using ACT and Mauve v2.3.1 85. Schematic plasmid drawings were constructed using DNAplotter 86. Amino acid sequence and protein structural-based alignments were performed using the CLC Free Workbench software tool (v. 6.1 CLC bio AS, Aarhus, Denmark) and the web-based interface for ESPript v.2.2 (http:espript.ibcp.frESPriptcgi-binESPript. cgi) 87, respectively. The 3-D structure of the proteins pChiA, pChiT, pChiO, pChiD, and pChiR were predicted using positionspecific iterative (PSI)- BLAST alignment and HHpred 38. Prevalence of pChi7122-2 ( eitA) and pChi7122-3 ( pilSand pilV) genes among avian and human pathogenic E. coli One hundred human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI) 19, eighty APEC strains, and forty-five enteric E. coli strains (from our collection) were screened by PCR 19 for the presence of the eitA, pilS, and pilVgenes using the primers eitAF: 59-AACTGCGGC- TATCAGGAGAC-3 9and eitAR:59-CAGGTCATATCCCA- CAGCTT-3 9;pilS F: 59-CTTCTCTTTCTGCACACCGT-3 9 and pilS R: 59-TGTGATTGTAACGGAGCC-3 9;pilV F: 59- TCTATACAGGCGAGTATTTA-3 9and pilVR: 59-AATTCA- TACCAGAATACTCA-3 9. The primers were designed from the sequence of pChi7122-2 ( eitA) and pChi7122-3 ( pilSand pilV). Growth comparison assays The growth rates of strains were compared in iron-sequestered medium using LB containing 100 mMo f a,a9-dipyridyl alone or supplemented with either Heme (Sigma, 600 mgm l21), hemoglo- bin (Sigma, 60 mgm l21), or FeSO 4(Sigma, 20 mM: control). The growth rates were also tested in minimal medium MM9 12, MM9 with thiamin (1 mgm l21) and 0.1 casamino acid, and supplemented with glucose, lactose, arabinose, mannose, galac-tose, glucuronic acid, or glucoronic acid (0.2) as source of carbon at 37 uC shaking (180 rpm). The OD 600was recorded every hour over 24-hour period. Interaction of strains with 3-D INT-407 human epithelial cells 3-D cultures of human INT-407 cells (ATCC CCL6) were used as model intestinal epithelium and were prepared as previously described 54. Approximately 106CFU of PBS-washed bacteria, grown rotating to an OD 6001.0 in LB, were added to each well (multiplicity of infection MOI, 10). For bacterial associationassays, the 24-well plates were incubated at 37 uCi n5 C O 2for 1 hour, and rinsed three times with PBS. PBS-0.1 (wv)deoxycholic acid sodium salt was added to each well, and sampleswere diluted and spread on MacConkey medium plates forenumeration by viable colony counting. For invasion assays,extracellular bacteria were killed following the initial 1-hincubation period by an additional 1-h incubation in medium containing gentamicin (100 mgml; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then washed 3 6with PBS and lysed. Bacterial titers in the lysates were determined by serial dilutions and plating on MacConkeyagar. The results were expressed as the Log 10CFUml. Antibodies specific for O78-LPS (Denken Seiken) and the human tight junction protein ZO-1 (Invitrogen) were used for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging. Antibodies were of porcine and mouse origins, respectively, and were used ata dilution of 1:500 (anti-O78-LPS) and 1:100 (anti-ZO-1). Goatanti-porcine and anti-mouse secondary antibodies labeled withAlexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) were used to detect the boundprimary antibodies anti-O78-LPS and anti-ZO-1 respectively andwere diluted 1:500 in blocking solution (8 bovine serumalbumin, 0.05 Triton-X100 in DPBS). Cell nuclei and the F-actin cytoskeleton were visualized with 4 9, 6-diamidino-2-pheny- lindole hydrochloride (DAPI) and phalloidin (Invitrogen), respec- tively. The fixation and staining of 3-D aggregates was performed as described previously 88. Optical sections of the 3-Daggregates were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Duo laserscanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets formonitoring emissions of the selected fluorophores. Images wereacquired using a Plan-Neofluar 40 61.3 oil DIC objective and were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM software package. Axiovision4.8 software from Carl Zeiss was used to further process collectedimages. Sensitivity of strains to deoxycholate (DOC) and acid shock tolerance To determine the ability of bacteria to survive at sub-lethal bile concentration, different strains were grown rotating to an OD 600 1.0 in LB medium. Five-microliters of serial ten-fold dilutions ofeach strain were spotted on both LB agar and LB agar containing1 (wv) DOC plates and incubated overnight at 37 uC. For acid shock assays, bacterial cells were grown at 37 uCi nL B broth, pH 7, ON standing. Cultures adjusted to the same OD 600 of 1.0 were diluted 1:1,000 in LB, pH 2.5, and incubated at 37 uC with gentle shaking (50 rpm). Samples were cultured by directplating on LB agar after 8 h and 18 h to determine the percentsurvival following acid stress. As controls, bacteria were also grownin LB, pH 7 in the same conditions to determine if the growth ofbacteria was affected. Biofilm formation assay Biofilm formation assays were performed in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) 89.

Aliquots of 200 mL for each dilution were dispensed per well into a microtiter plate (four wellsstrain). Each strain was tested inquadruplicate, wells containing sterile medium were used as negative controls. Plates were sealed with parafilm and cultured standing either at 30 uC, 37 uCo r4 2 uC for 5 days to mimic the environmental and body temperature of humans and chickens,respectively. The media of the plates were then decanted, and the plates were washed twice with sterile PBS. Microplates were then stained with 200 mL of 1 (wv) Crystal Violet for 30 min, followed by washing twice with PBS to remove unbound dye. After drying, dye-containing adherent cells were resolubilized with 200mL of 30 (vv) acetic acid solution. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm in an ELISA reader (SpectraMax M2,Molecular Devices). All tests were carried out at least three times, and the results were averaged. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferronis multiple-comparison test (GraphPadPrism software, version 5.07). Differences between average values were also tested for significance by performing an unpaired, two- sided Student ttest. The levels of significance ( Pvalues) are reported and values 0.05 were taken to be significant. Supporting Information Figure S1 Plasmids genomes comparison.

        "introduction": "Escherichia coli are versatile bacteria; with the majority being non-pathogenic and considered as commensals. A subset of thesebacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer anability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum ofintestinal and extra-intestinal diseases 1,2. One of the importantaspects of the fitness of E. coli is thought to be its ability to survive and persist in a variety of environments, including variedanatomical niches, food, soils, poultry litter, and acidic conditions.Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) cause infections outside of their normal intestinal habitat in both mammals and birds,resulting in a considerable economic and public health burden3,4. Major infections associated with ExPEC in humans includeurinary tract infections (UTI), newborn meningitis (NBM) andsepticemia 4. In birds, a subgroup of ExPEC, named Avian Pathogenic E. coli (APEC), causes a complex of systemic infections,mainly respiratory, often leading to death 4. The genetic relationship between APEC and other ExPEC of human and animal origin 4 emphasizes the potential zoonotic risk of avian-derived E. coli strains. In poultry, isolates associated with fecal matter, environmental contamination and chicken meat products possess virulence gene profiles similar to those causing human outbreaks 5,6, which suggests that retail chicken may be an important reservoir for E. coli causing ExPEC infections in humans. ExPEC exhibit a high degree of antigenic and genetic diversity, which complicates their diagnosis and the design of cross- protective vaccines 7. ExPEC are defined by a limited number of O-antigens, with specific O antigens being associated withcertain clinical syndromes. For example, E. coli from a small number of O serogroups (O4, O6, O14, O22, O75, and O83) cause 75 of urinary tract infections 8 and a limited number ofserotypes, principally O1, O2, O78, O8, and O35, are commonly PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 January 2012  Volume 7  Issue 1  e29481implicated in avian colibacillosis 9, suggesting that not all O polysaccharides have identical virulence properties 10,11. The possession of multiple large plasmids is often a defining feature of ExPEC, especially APEC, in which the virulence is partly plasmid-mediated 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Although many studies have been dedicated to understanding the pathogenesis of ExPEC, little is known about the mechanismsof their persistence. Since a correlation between the ecology ofbacteria and their virulence exists, understanding the mechanismsof fitness and survival of these bacteria in extreme and changingconditions would not only improve our understanding of theirpersistence, but also will contribute to better design strategies for their prevention and treatments. Previously, the model APEC strain x7122 (O78:K80:H9), containing three large plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3, previously named pAPEC-1, pAPEC-2, and pAPEC-3 respectively, and a cryptic plasmid pChi7122-4 (Table 1), hasbeen used to undestand the role of large plasmids in the virulenceof ExPEC 12. Specifically, we determined that both the nature ofplasmids and their combinations have an effect on the virulenceand the genetic diversity of ExPEC. Although we have clearlydetermined that pChi7122-1 has a major role in systemic infectionof APEC in chickens, the role of the remaining plasmids remained unclear. Since pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 do not encode for common ExPEC virulence factors 12, and their roles are considered asminor in systemic infection in chickens 12, we hypothesized thatthese plasmids could be important in persistence of this bacterialstrain in different stressful conditions encountered before and during infections. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) fully sequence and analyze the DNA of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 of APEC strain x7122; and (2) evaluate the contribution of these plasmids, as well the plasmid pChi7122-1,either individually or in combination, in the bacterial interaction with a model human intestinal epithelial cell line, bile and acid resistance, biofilm formation, and growth in iron-restricted medium and in the presence of different carbon sources. Moreover, since the plasmids can be carried by strains with different backgrounds, we aimed to determine the effect of different host strain backgrounds on plasmid-associated pheno- types. This study presents for the first time the sequence of three plasmids of APEC strain x7122 and provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms that ExPEC may use for their persistence and survival in stressful conditions.",
        "conclusion": "A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in other E. coli strains but found in Salmonella serovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriae piloperon were located on pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 respectively. Multipleplasmid-encoded mechanisms, including toxin-antitoxin modulesand the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness andpersistence of APEC x7122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2) when present in E. coli K-12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122-3) in the wild-type background. Four differentfactor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, rough-LPS-,and O-LPS-mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor-driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could havedistinct functions. Some of them could be important in theacquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in theenvironment; others could be involved in virulence. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid-derivative strains of an ExPECmodel strain x7122 (O78:K80:H9) revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity.
