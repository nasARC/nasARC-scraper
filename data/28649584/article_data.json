Then SALK_084889 plants were subjected to qPCR to examine the expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1. The drought and heat responses of SALK_084889 were also performed. Data source locationUF, Gainesville, USA Data accessibility Data is within this article. Value of the data C15T-DNA insertion lines provide important resource for genetic analysis based on mutagenesis in plant research. SALK lines are the most widely used T-DNA insertion lines for the model plant Arabidopsis. Accurate assessment of insertions is critical for understanding the value of the insertion lines. C15SALK_084889 is annotated as a T-DNA insertion line of DREB2A , a key regulator of drought and heat response in Arabidopsis. We characterized DREB2A expression in normal and drought conditions in this line, which is relevant for analysis of DREB2A mutants in further investigation. C15The LOX1 gene plays a critical role in multiple bioprocesses associated with lipid peroxidation. Our data identi ed a T-DNA insertion within promoter of LOX1 and showed the knock-out expression of LOX1 in SALK_084889. These are valuable information for mutation analysis of LOX1 . 1.

Fig. 1 shows the T-DNA bands ampli ed within DREB2A (AT5G05410) and LOX1 (AT1G55020) genes of SALK_084889 as well as T-DNA insertion sites determined by Sanger sequencing. Fig. 2 AB show DREB2A expression in both roots and shoots in normal conditions with or without drought treatment. Fig. 2 CD show LOX1 expression in roots and shoots in normal conditions.

Experimental design, materials and methods Arabidopsis seeds of wild tyoe (Col) and SALK_084889 were obtained from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.

For identi cation of T-DNA insertion sites, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in soil at 22 C under constant light condition. Eight randomly selected SALK_084889 seedlings were subjected toDNA-PCR to con rm all seeds are homozygous. For DREB2A , the gene speci c primers DREB2A-F andM. Zhou et al.

The students t-test was performed to show the signi cant difference of survival rate between Col and SALK_084889 ( po0.01). Fig. 2. Relative expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 . The expression of DREB2A was determined in roots (A) and shoots (B) of Col or SALK_084889 plants with or without drought treatments. The expression of LOX1 was determined in roots (C) and shoots (D) of Col or SALK_084889 plants in normal condition. The expression levels of DREB2A orLOX1 in Col in normal conditions were initiated as 1so that relative expression levels of other samples were determined. The UBQ11 (AT4G05050) gene was used as the internal control. The Ct (cycle threshold) values are shown in Supplementary table 1 . Data are means 7SE (n3). The students t-test was performed to show the signi cant difference of gene expression between Col and SALK_084889 (po0.05,  po0.01).M. Zhou et al.  Data in Brief 13 (2017) 253 258 256DREB2A-R were used to amplify wild type allele band while LBb1.3 and DREB2A-R primers were used to amplify T-DNA band. For LOX1 , the gene speci c primers LOX1-F and LOX1-R were used to amplify wild type allele band while LBb1.3 and LOX1-R primers were used to amplify T-DNA band. Theamplicons of T-DNA bands of DREB2A and LOX1 were puri ed by subjected to sanger sequencing and the alignment of sequences was performed using Vector NTI v10.0 program (InforMax Inc). For Expression analysis, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in 0.5 C2MS media (2.2 g of MS basal salts (Sigma), 5 g of Sucrose, 0.5 g of MES, and 1 mL of 1,000 C2Gamborg vitamins (Sigma) per liter at pH 5.75) at 22 C under constant light condition. The 14 day old plants were harvested from MS plates and directly preserved in RNALater (Ambion) 2. For drought treatment, harvested Arabidopsis plants were dehydrated on Whatman 3mm paper (Whatman) at 22 C and 60 humidity under dim light for 2h3prior to xation in RNALater. For RNA extraction, root and shoot tissues were dissected in RNALater solution and then total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Quanti-tative realtime PCR was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) and 2 -Ct method was employed to calculate the relative expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 . Three replicates were used for each sample and UBQ11 (AT4G05050) gene was used as the internal control. For drought and heat tolerance determination of SALK_084889, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in soil at 22 C under constant light condition. For drought test, the 10 day old plants were transferred to pre-dried soil and withhold water for 4 days prior to recovery by watering for 7 days 4. For heat test, the 7 day old plants were pre-incubated in 37 C for 1 h and then treated at 49 C for 1 h prior to Fig. 4. Heat tolerance of SALK_084889.
