INTRODUCTION Since Yuri Gagarin rst traveled to space in 1961, human spaceight activity has grown rapidly. One of the most notable events to date was the 1998 launch of the I nternational Space Stati on (ISS), a lower Earth or- biting research platform, which allows astronauts to live and work in space for up to a year at a time.1The microgravity environment of space presents an extreme environmental stressor, which induces a multitude of physiological maladaptations including, but not limited to, skeletal muscle and bone loss, cardiovasculardecline, immune compromise, 2neuronal damage, and decreased gray matter volume.3These resemble some of the adverse health changes associated with chronological aging on Earth, and additionally serve as an accelerated model of other non-communicable health concerns such as diabetes, cardiovascular dis-ease, and obesity. 4As people look to travel further into space a nd for longer periods than ever before owing to the rise in commercial spaceight and increasingly lower cost access to spaceunderstanding the mechanistic underpinnings of spaceight-induced maladaptation is essential to developing effectivecountermeasures that promote safe space travel and also benet health on Earth. Human and rodent studies have provided invaluable insight into the mechanistic regulation of the micro- gravity phenotype; however, they are limited by signicant operational (e.g., crew time, humanrodentnumbers, and sample feasibility) and econ omical (e.g., high costs) constraints. 5,6Alternative model organ- isms are, therefore, required to achieve the experimental power necessary to draw conclusions on the causes of space-induced health decline. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans ) is a non-parasitic, micro- scopic ( C240.251 mm) nematode characterized by a short lifespan ( C243 weeks), large brood size, fully sequenced genome, multiple evolutionary conserved mechanisms, ease of culture, and low expense,7pre- senting a primary biologically relevant model for spaceight research that is relatively cheap and feasible.In fact, C. elegans spaceight experiments have been conducted since the time of the space shuttle. Pre- vious studies have shown that C. elegans can mate, reproduce, and undergo embryonic development dur- ing spaceight, and they are also susceptible to radiation-induced mutations during spaceight. 8,9How- ever, since these experiments were performed on ordinary agar medium, the effects of stronghydrostatic pressure adhesion between the C. elegans and the agar surface could not be ruled out. There- fore, in examining the effects of microgravity, a liqu id culture was devised.

However, the C. elegans were found alive a few days later, protected by a sturdy container.10Since then, our space experiments have been conducted using CeMM ( C. elegans Mainte- nance Medium)11andE. coli OP-50 liquid media. In addition, C. elegans permit the use of genetic and mo- lecular tools (e.g., genetic mutants), to dissect speci c biological pathways and trial emerging countermea- sures, such as the efcacy of preclinical drugs.12Since C. elegans display high molecular, metabolic, and physiologic orthology with people, with as much as 83 of the C. elegans proteome sharing homologous genes with humans,13they serve as efcient model organisms to understand (human) disease processes. For example, their use as a biomedical research mode l organism has been invaluable in the study of Alz- heimer disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.14Specic to spaceight, C. elegans successfully live in microgravity15and display reduced movement capacity,16analogous to the decline in muscle function observed in astronauts post-ight,17demonstrating the suitability of C. elegans as a model organism to study the effects of spaceight on physiology. Therefore, using C. elegans to uncover the precise molecular mechanisms regulating adaptations to microgravity c an signicantly accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms of spaceight-induced physiological decline in humans. Recently, there has been an exponential increase in the use of omics technologies and informatic tools to probe the etiology of, and develop countermeasures for, pathological states,18including spaceight.19 The application of omics seeks to establish the sum of the parts within a biological system, rather than iden- tifying individual components, promoting a holistic rather than reductive path of biological study.20In addi- tion to the benecial systems biology approach, omics can capitalize on pre-existing biological samples(i.e., samples that were collected before the omics  boom and bio-banked samples), which are partic- ularly rare in the context of spaceight. Recently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched project GeneLab to allow free and unrestricted access to omics data from spaceightexperiments to researchers all over the globe. 21The success of this open-science model has maximized the use of scarce spaceight biological samples and led to several discoveries othe rwise not possible, such as the identication of spaceight CO 2levels as a confounding variable in the animal enclosure modules used in rodent experiments.22More recently, the European Space Agency (ESA)-funded Space Omics Topical Team has supported new and ongoing ESA scientic community activities that focus on the application and exploitation of omics research in space.23,24Indeed, omics technology has been applied to spaceight research using C. elegans , leading to a more complete understanding of biological processes that occur in response to spaceight, although these works remain to be consolidated. The aim of this narrative review is, therefore, to summarize the literature pertaining to the use of C. elegans as a model organism for spaceight-related research wi th a specic focus on publications that have applied omics technologies to uncover the mechanistic basis of the microgravity phenotype, thus highlighting how the extensive use of C. elegans in spaceight research has constructed a more coherent picture of the bio- logical response to spaceight. To do this, we provi de an overview of the available omics literature, including hyper-, micro-, and simulated gravity scenarios, highlighting key biological themes and, where relevant, highlight how the molecular ight-responsive signatures in worms correspond with known molec- ular andor functional adaptations reported in hig her animals and humans. We also summarize the impact of the C. elegans space omics literature to date and highlight what we believe are the next frontiers in C. elegans space omics research. Although previous reviews have appreciated the use of C. elegans as a model organism for spaceight research, these reviews have either not focused on omics25or are non- comprehensive due to geographical constraints.24Thus, global efforts combining C. elegans and omics in space remain to be detailed. OMICS INVESTIGATIONS OF C. ELEGANS IN MICROGRAVITY To date, the majority of omics spaceight research in C. elegans is transcriptomic in nature, with far fewer proteomic investigations and compar ative omics analysis (summarized in Tables 1 ,2,a n d 3, respectively). Together, these investigations have revealed robust metabolic and neuromuscular biological themes, dis- cussed herein ( Figure 1 ). Metabolic alterations in microgravity Both transcriptomic and proteomic investigations have been applied in an effort to understand the biological response of C. elegans to spaceight, which have revealed robust metabolic alterations.

The rst investigation into the transcriptional responses in spaceown worms was ICE-FIRST in 2006. Using microarray analysis, the authors demonstrated a metabolic shift occurring mainly in the intes- tines that could be underlaid by altered TGF- band insulin signaling ( Figure 1 ).39Considering the possible implications for altered endocrine signaling due to altered metabolism of lipids as well as alterations to innateimmunity, these changes to TGF- band insulin signaling warrant further study. 32,39 Just as microgravity is associated with consistent insulin signaling changes, simulated microgravity also elicits reproducible insulin signaling changes. For example, a recent study looking at simulated micro-gravity-exposed C. elegans found altered expression in the insulinIGF-1 signaling pathway. 26Another study found that simulated microgravity-exposed C. elegans demonstrated decreased expression of linc-50 , an intestinal long non-coding RNA which appear s to target FoxO transcription factor DAF-16, which is part of the insulin signaling pathway downstream of the insulin receptorDAF-2.28 Another element of the ICE-FIRST effort was also the rst known proteomic investigation into spaceownC. elegans , which found that spaceight reduced aconitase expression; a citric acid cycle enzyme respon- sible for citrate-isocitrate conversion, which could affect ATP generation ( Figure 1 ). 41Other studies have demonstrated a similar pattern of alterations to ge nes and processes involved in the generation of ATP. For example, one such study found 86 differentially expressed genes in response to spaceight, whichwere related to the process of mitochondrial respiration, which is the nal step of the process of cellular respiration that generates ATP. 34 Subsequent proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of spaceown C. elegans from the 2009 CERISE exper- iment also displayed alterations in metabolism on two fronts. First, the mitochondrial anchorage protein, ANC-1, was found to have decreased levels of expression.33ANC-1 is involved in nuclear anchorage and positioning, as well as the positioning of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.43Mutations to ANC-1 negatively affect the health of C. elegans , with ANC-1 mutants displaying smaller body sizes, changes to the shape of the nucleus, fragmentation of the endoplasmic reticulum, and movement of thenucleus and endoplasmic reticulum during body movement. 43Second, multiple metabolic proteins in all stages of cellular respiration, including glycolysis and the glyoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis, and the elec- tron transport chain, were found in signicantly reduced levels ( Figure 1 ).33 The launch of the NASA GeneLab database21and more recent initiatives such as the ESA-funded Space Omics Topical Team23,24has allowed access to vast amounts of spaceight-related omics data, including that fromTable 2.

Such access facilitates comparative omics investigations, that is using multiple datasets from different conditionsspecies to identify reproducible omics proles, maximizing the scientic return on invest-ment. In one such comparative analysis, the authors aimed to understand whether the transcriptional proles of microgravity are the inverse of the hypergravity expression pattern, a hypothesis worthy of investigation considering the divergent physiological adaptations to microgravity versus hypergravity. 5The authors found that while most common gene signatures were similarly up- or downregulated, genes pertaining to the Gene Ontology term metabolic regulation displayed opposing regulation, being upregulated in hypergravity and downregulated in microgravity.5Downstream network analysis identied a tyrosine degrading enzyme, hpd-1 , as the most highly connected hub gene providing a candidate for future therapeutic targeting.5 Research into similarities in the response to spacei ght between organisms has demonstrated that the sub- sequent metabolic changes are not unique to C. elegans. One study used comparative omics to explore spaceight gene expression changes between Drosophila melanogaster andC. elegans in order to under- stand how similarly or dissimilarly these organisms respond to spaceight.42Surprisingly, only 6 genes were commonly downregulated in both organisms, several of which were associated with metabolic signaling,although due to ortholog-related challenges the number of genes that could be compared was reduced to roughly only 20 of the comparative genome. 42 Examined together, all of the studies discussed previously demonstrate a clear pattern of metabolicchanges in response to spaceight and microgravity, affecting primarily the mitochondria and the pro- cesses involved in the generation of ATP. Decline in mitochondrial ATP production occurs naturally withage, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been found in humans with a variety of health conditions, includingtype 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. 44Further, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked as be- ing both a cause and consequence of muscle atrophy due to muscle disuse.45,46These alterations in mito- chondria could also partly explain phenotypes in other high energy-consuming tissues such as neurons.47 Therefore, understanding these metabolic changes induced in spaceight contributes to understanding the cause of muscle decline and alterations in other tissue systems observed in astronauts.Table 3.

For example, spaceown C. elegans from ICE-FIRST were characterized by altered muscle development, which was accompanied by corresponding declines in myosin heavy chain isoform gene expression16and locomotion-related genes ( Figure 1 ).40It should be noted that the ICE-FIRST exper- iments were carried out in a chemically dened medium, which permitted the study of the effects of surface tension in spaceight, but signicantly alters C. elegans development akin to dietary restriction.33,48Proteo- mic analysis from the same spaceight mission (ICE-FIRST) found the core thick lament protein, paramyosin,was reduced in spaceown samples. 41Additionally, spaceight reduced troponin T, which binds tropomyosin and tethers the troponin complex to the thin lament, but increased troponin T phosphorylation.41These data suggest that these genes and proteins may play a key role in the maintenance of muscle structureand function, and that their expressional change may be involved in spaceight-induced muscle decline. Utilizing quantitative isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation methodology, the follow-on CERISE experiment found that spaceown C. elegans d i s p l a y e da ni n c r e a s ei n1 6p r o t e i n sm o s t l yr e l a t e d to protein synthesis, including ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors, and a decrease in 43 proteins, predominantly cytoskeletal, muscular, and mitochondrial related. 33Spaceight-induced declines in muscular (e.g., UNC-15 (paromysin)) and cytoskeletal (e.g., ACT-5 (actin)) gene and protein expressionhave been shown, suggesting that the observed downregulation in these genes translates to reduced expression of the encoded protein. 33Importantly, physiological declines, such as reduced body length and altered movement, were also present suggesting t hese translational expre ssion changes are physio- logically meaningful. Of particular importance, the downregulation of myosin heavy chain and paramyosin genes reproduced earlier proteomic observations,41providing conrmation that the observed proteomic changes were indeed due to microgravity. Two recent studies highlighted potential therapeutic avenues to target in order to offset muscle decline in space. Sudevan et al. demonstrated that spaceown C. elegans from 3 independent spaceight missions consis- tently displayed decreased comt-4 gene expression ( Figure 1 ), which is a catechol- O-methyltransferase dopa- mine degradation enzyme.27Thus, targeting the dopamine system may be a viable and realistic therapeutic to promote health in space. Another study found that simulated microgravity-exposed C. elegans whichA B Figure 1.

In one comparative analysis study, it was demon- strated that C. elegans transcriptional response to spaceight demonstrates greater similarity with mouse extensor digitorum longus (fast-twitch muscle) compared to the soleus (slow-twitch muscle).12Consistent with these observations, a shift from slow-twitch ber toward fast-twitch ber was seen in the soleus muscle in spaceown mice.49This may suggest that C. elegans results can be extrapolated to mammalian results; however, the caveat of this analysis is that whole C. elegans (i.e., muscle, neurons, gut, and reproductive tis- sue) were utilized and so the transcriptional signature is not isolated to C. elegans muscle.12 There are also spaceight experiments not yet published that are exploring neuromuscular changes during spaceight and generating transcriptomic datasets. For example, in 2018, there was the launch of the rstUK-led experiment to the ISS, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME), which aims to demonstrate the precise mechanisms underlying muscle decline in space and to explore the efcacy of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at insulin signaling and muscle attachment complexes for offsetting spaceight-induced muscledecline. 50More recently in 2021, there was the follow-up Molecular Muscle Experiment 2 (MME2), which aims to conrm past spaceight-induced gene expression changes (i.e., MME) and trial the efcacy of pharmacolog- ical interventions aimed at improving mitochondrial health and neuromuscular signaling. Through collaborationwith NASA GeneLab, samples from MME and MME2 have been subjected to RNA-sequencing and are under- going analysis. Together, the research discussed previously has highlighted many muscular and neuromuscular alterations in response to spaceight and microgravity, provid ing the mechanistic basis for future studies of how microgravity elicits muscle adaptations in C. elegans . 33Importantly, some of these reproducible gene expression changes observed in spaceown C. elegans ,s u c ha sd e c r e a s e dm y o s in expression, are also observed in rodents and humans.51Thus, spaceight-induced changes in C. elegans gene expression are conserved in higher organisms and may explain the muscle decline observed in astronauts. MicroRNA and epigenetic alterations in microgravity Transcriptional understanding of spaceight (patho)physiology has been built upon by researchers basedin China, following the SZ-8 mission. These authors focused on understanding the role of microRNAs (non- coding RNAs that control gene expression via the destabilization of messenger RNA targets at the post-transcriptional level and via translational inhibition) in response to microgravity and space radiation versus space radiation in isolation. 37The authors found microRNAs that are altered in spaceight,37more so than in response to radiation alone,35are involved in developmental, DNA damage, apoptotic, and metabolic responses.3437The authors found that microRNAs are involved in apoptotic gene expression due to the stressors of spaceight ( Figure 1 ).36Additionally, another study found that C. elegans exposed to micro- gravity demonstrated greater non-coding RNA gene expression.31The data from these studies suggest that epigenetic changes occur with microgravity exposure.31 Microgravity has also been shown to alter DNA repair genes and the regulatory microRNAs. In a recent inte-grative analysis combining transcriptional and microRNA datasets from 3 microgravity experiments that eachincluded spaceight, spaceight control with a 1-G centrifugal device, and ground control conditions, Zhao and colleagues reported signicant alterations in the expression of DNA repair genes in response to micro- gravity. 52Their integrative analysis approach allowed the identication of microRNAs as potential post-tran- scriptional regulators that regulate the DNA repair gene expression in microgravity conditions. For example, under spaceightground control conditions, the authors reported that 6 differentially expressed miRNAs (cel-miR-90, cel-miR-124, cel-miR-124, cel-miR-355, cel-miR-795, and cel-lsy-6) potentially regulate the ex-pressions of 4 DNA repair genes ( rfs-1,rcq-5 ,xpc-1 ,and mnat-1 ), 52demonstrating the power of omic analysis to provide insight into the altered DNA response in microgravity conditions. Considering robust transcriptional changes occur in spaceown C. elegans , it has been suggested that epigenetic changes may also occur since epigenetic modications, such as DNA methylation and histone modications, regulate gene expression.29Despite this sound hypothesis, research into the epigeneticll OPEN ACCESS 8 iScience 26, 107189, July 21, 2023iScienc e Reviewresponses of spaceown C. elegans has only recently begun. In the only relevant study known to date, mi- croarray analysis revealed that 39 genes expressed in C. elegans in response to microgravity are sup- pressed by the action of HDA-4.29This suggests that microgravity-induced transcriptional changes are potentially, in part, epigenetically controlled, thus calling for further research into the epigenetic programs underpinning microgravity adaptations, especially considering the potential heritability of any epigeneticchanges. 53The potential intergenerational effects of spaceight have already been reported in mice, where one study found that the offspring of space-traveled mice demonstrated altered expression of genes in the liver.54Further study will build a deeper understanding of the effects of microgravity on the epigenome and the potential ramications for any potential future offspring of spaceown organisms and astronauts. INSIGHTS AND IMPACT OF C. ELEGANS SPACE OMICS WORK As elucidated previously, space omics studies in C. elegans have generated several valuable insights on the molecular regulation of spaceight m aladaptation which, in turn, stand to benecially impact future trans- latable research efforts toward better understanding and counteracting spaceight-induced health de-clines. For instance, transcriptomic analyses highlight strong overlap of dysregulated genes inC. elegans from different spaceight missions, de spite variant experimental factors. 5,33These reproducible ndings highlight the utility of C. elegans as a prime model organism for robust spaceight omics investi- gation and in particular future efforts aimed at ameliorating impaired molecular responses to spaceight(the MME and MME2 missions as two examples). Particularly evident from previous worm space omics research are reproducible expression change s in neuronalmuscular and metabolic genes. 5,33Given that worms in space might feasibly tract neuromuscular changes in gene expression of higher organisms inspace, 12o m i c sw o r kt od a t et h u sa l s op i n p o i n t s C. elegans as an especially valuable model for understand- ing molecular causes of and developing countermeasures to declines in astronaut muscle health. Interestingly, dysregulation of key muscle genes is evident even when spaceown worms are compared to onboard 1-G control worms,33implicating that such expression changes are the consequence of micro- gravity more so than increased radiation exposure. That mechanical load is th e partial driver of muscle changes in space is further supported by other previous worm space microarray analyses, wherein dystro-phin (a highly mechanosensitive molecule that plays a key role in maintaining muscle structurefunction) 55 was shown to be important in the omics response to spaceight, particularly with respect to neuromus-cularcytoskeletal changes. 56In fact, transcriptional changes in w orms generally appear more widespread in the spaceight environment th an with space radiations alone,35with C. elegans work thus indicating that microgravity is the more predominant effector of spaceight omics changes. More specically, the space r a d i a t i o nd o s eo nt h eI S Si s C240.51 mSv per day, including C2450 charged particlessrcm2 with high linear energy transfer (10 keV mm).5759Since an adult nematode C. elegans isC241 mm long and 0.05 mm wide, the probability of a direct hit by charged particles is relatively low. In addition, DNA damage by heavy par- ticle radiation, not only ionizing radiation, is efciently repaired in meiotic oocytes, which make up the ma-jority of nematode adult gonads, because of their high homologous recombination activity. 60,61Thus, it is challenging to precisely evaluate the effects of space radiation in omics analyses using a large number of C. elegans cultured for a short period. Instead, the effects of space radiation on C. elegans are mainly stud- i e db ye x a m i n i n gt h ef r e q u e n c yo fm u t a t i o n st h a tc a nb eo b s e r v e di ne a c hi n d i v i d u a ln e m a t o d e .8,62,63Thus, while it appears from studies in C. elegans that radiation exposure in lower Earth orbit is not a major contributor to observed omics changes, the effects i n higher mammals and humans, as well as the potential effects beyond in lower Earth orbit and the protective effects of the Van Allen belts, render the conse-quences of spaceight radiation on omicsbiology uncertain. Omics work in spaceown worms has also provided seve ral important insights into upstream regulatory mechanisms of spaceight molecular responses. F or example, microarray analysis of spaceown C. elegans implicates a prominence toward insulin signaling regulation of spaceight-induced expression changes 39that is likely to be partly driven by DAF-16FoxO25though more recent comparative transcrip- tomic analyses of C. elegans suggest that FoxO regulation of gene ex pression may be a stress response to altered gravity per se .5Regardless, given that FoxO signaling is a highly conserved regulatory pathway across species,64such worm omics data should provide a strong basis to accelerate mechanistic under- standing of poor spaceight adap tations of higher organisms.5Indeed, recent evidence supports insulin signaling alterations during spaceight in higher organisms, including both rodents and astronauts.65 Finally, more recent transcriptomic-driven analysis of spaceown worms suggests that dopamine signalingll OPEN ACCESS iScience 26, 107189, July 21, 2023 9iScienc e Reviewis also perturbed with microgravity.27Key implications and insights from C. elegans space omics work have been further summarized in Figure 1 . NEXT FRONTIERS IN C. ELEGANS SPACE OMICS Linking omics to phenotype While understanding the molecular responses to microgravity in isolation are important, these will be more informative if they quantitatively link to functional outcomes. Using informatic approaches, authors can, and should, directly relate the C. elegans omics signatures to functional outcomes such as movement rate andor strength, to identify biologically important pathways and molecules regulating the phenotypicresponses to microgravity. Ideally, all of these analyses would be performed in the same animals to make rm mechanistic links. 33Indeed, such omics-phenotype links have been made previously, albeit not in the context of spaceown C. elegans .66,67This approach can also be taken toward the creation and application of personalized medicine in the treatment of human disease. The potential use of C. elegans as a model organism for personalized medicine is already being explored in various ways. One study explored using C. elegans as a model for examining variations in metabolism between individuals via the application of metabolomics and comparative genomics, demonstrating differences in the levels of several metabolitesbetween four strains of C. elegans . 68This demonstrates the use of C. elegans as a building block toward understanding the differences in metabolism between individuals within a species.68 Integrated multi-omics Without doubt, transcriptomics and proteomics are the most common omics analyses performed thus far in C. elegans subjected to microgravity conditions. However, microgravity likely affects many other biological layers, therefore the use of other omics can contribute to a more complete understanding of the effects ofspaceight. For example, C. elegans -specic metabolomics and lipidomics methodologies are emerging, 69providing additional and powerful omics capabilities to probe the pathophysiological effects of spaceight and reveal the potential of therapeutic interventions. These multiple omics approaches canbe integrated (i.e., at the computati onal analysis stage) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the condition-specic crosstalk between different biological levels, therein providing a better understanding of microgravity-inducing mechanisms and the identication of novel candidates for therapeutic interven- tion. Indeed, this approach has been taken in C. elegans to investigate responses to aging, 70starvation,71 and antibiotics,72albeit not in the context of spaceight. Tissue-specic and spatial omics It is notable that the majority of omics work to date has been generated using RNAprotein extracted from whole worms containing all tissue types (i.e., muscles, gut, and neurons) as opposed to individual tissues, and so the tissue-specic transcriptomeproteome responses to altered gravity are yet to be distin- guished.5Indeed, it is possible to isolate and sequence individual tissues derived from C. elegans ,73 and since spaceight can induced a wide variety of maladaptations across many organs, understanding tis- sue-specic responses to microgravity is necessary in order to precisely underpin regulatory mechanisms and develop targeted and effective countermeasur es against spaceight-induced maladaptations. Further, conventional microarray and RNA-sequencing approaches do not provide spatial information, and tissue-specic transcriptomics only partially solves this problem since it still takes into account ubiquitously expressed genes (i.e., housekeeper genes).74Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging method to overcome these limitations, which combines RNA-sequencing with serial tissue sectioning75to identify tissue-specic spatiotemporal gene responses. By adapting the RNA tomography approach originally developed for ze- brash,75Ebbing and co-authors were able to successfully apply spatial transcriptomics to C. elegans , which was considered a major challenge due to the limited amount of mRNA that can be extracted from individual sections of small organisms.74The authors individually froze and cryosectioned (20 mm) C. elegans , followed by RNA extraction and processing using CEL-seq (to overcome the challenges of low input).76Using this combination of tools, the authors were able to detect an average of 16,394 genes in young wild-type adult hermaphrodites, equating to 93 of genes detected in bulk RNA-sequencing ex- periments,77and they also demonstrated regional expression was highly indicative of function.74Thus, spatial transcriptomics offers a highly sensitive method to generate complex data, and develop deeper un-derstanding of tissue organization, or disorganization, in disease. Spatial transcriptomics has been used to create tissue atlases that have served not only particular use in creating detailed maps of the nervousll OPEN ACCESS 10 iScience 26, 107189, July 21, 2023iScienc e Reviewsystem of mice but also furthered understanding of i mportant topics in biology like heart development.78 Currently, the application of C. elegans spatial transcriptomics is in its infancy with only three publications known to date,74,79,80none of which have been conducted in the context of microgravity. Similarly, cell-spe- cic proteomics methodologies that permit analysis of body wall muscles, neurons, and pharyngeal mus- cles have been developed81but are yet to be exploited in the context of microgravity. In the absence of high-throughput spatiotemporal techniques, spatiotemporal insight is traditionally and routinely gained in C. elegans through the utility of GFP.38,82Capitalizing on the nematodes transparent body, GFP is tagged to a geneprotein of interest t o gain information on expression patterns and sub- cellular localization in vivo . In the context of simulated microgravity, Zhao and colleagues demonstrated the temporal induction of oxidative stress and the underlying mechanisms.82In the context of microgravity, the utility of GFP helped to demonstrate that treatment with RNAi works as effectively in space as it does onEarth in multiple tissues. 38Most recently, as part of the MME, GFP was exploited to monitor neuronal re- sponses to microgravity.47 In summary, despite the potential promise of these emerging methods for transforming our mechanisticunderstanding of spaceight (patho)physiology, these methods must be trialed for effectiveness in the spaceight environment, much like RNAi technology was. 38 CONCLUSION C. elegans represents a cheap and feasible organism to study the mechanisms regulating phenotypic ad- aptations in response to microgravity. We highlight that the application of omics analysis to spaceightresearch has identied many ways that C. elegans respond to microgravity, at the level of the transcrip- tome, proteome, and epigenome. Notably, microgravity e licits transcriptional responses with microgravity robustly regulating genes related to muscle locomotion and metabolism ( Figure 1 ). Similarly, proteomic changes in microgravity represent robust declines in cytoskeletal and metabolic proteins, which may un- derpin the pathophysiological phenotype associated wit h microgravity, particularly muscle decline. Impor- tantly, these major transcriptional signatures are reproducible despite substantial differences in culturingconditions. Future work should consider using emerging omics approaches, such as multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics, to unravel tissue-spec ic spatiotemporal responses to microgravity in C. elegans . Where possible, such experiments should adopt, or at least consider, consortium-devised omics-related working pipelines in order to standa rdize experimental design, such as those developed by the International Standards for Space Omics Processi ng. In turn, this will facilitate future comparative omics investigations, thus extracting as much insight as possible from rare space omics experiments. This will lead to the identication of the fundamental mechanisms regulating (mal)adaptations to micro-gravity, beneting health while in space and on Earth (e.g., aging, diabetes).
