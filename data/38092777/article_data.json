Although intense physical exercise is currently the main countermeasure, it requires a signi cant amount of time from each astronaut (2.5 hours per day, including equipment setup and breakdown), and even with exercise, the continuous exposure to microgravity cannot be fully offset. It has been proposed that muscle atrophy may be at least partly explained by the dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca2levels due to abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump s ability to reuptake cytoplasmic Ca2during muscle relaxation1. Mammalian muscles are broadly classi ed into two types: slow-twitch muscles composed predominantly of oxidative muscle bers (e.g., postural muscles like the soleus SOL, which is found in the calf and is important for resisting the pull of gravity) and fast-twitch muscles composed predominantly of glycolytic muscle bers (e.g., explosive muscles like the tibialis anterior TA, located in the shin). The SOL and TA are two of the primary muscles impacted by space ight, and previous studies have shown that both the murine SOL and TA will atrophy in response to microgravity exposure1,3. With respect to Ca2handling, recent work has shown that during space ight, Ca2uptake is impaired in the SOL muscle while being enhanced in the TA muscle, indicating that SERCA function is affected differently in the two muscle types1. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these aberrations in Ca2 reuptake by SERCA are not very well elucidated. Additionally, as Ca2handling at the level of SERCA was not impaired in the TA, itis possible that there may be other molecular drivers of the muscle atrophy phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level is important for prevention and mitigation. Machine learning (ML) methods are particularly effective in identifying patterns in complex biological data, particularly for discovering biomarkers in heterogeneous, high-dimensional, multi-omics datasets4. Compared to traditional statistical methods, ML methods are also less prone to distribution-speci c effects5, making them a promising alternative to classic systems biology.This is particularly important for space biological research, where small datasets are often combined to increase statistical power. In this study, we present an ML-based approach to create a mapping between changes in multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic) and calcium reuptake in the SOL and TA muscles of mice that have been own in space, compared to ground controls. To our knowledge, this approach has not beenapplied to this scienti c question before. When choosing an ML method for the purposes of gaining insight into biomedical research, it is important to consider two criteria: explainabilityinterpretability and generalizability. Many conventional state-of-the-art algorithms, such as neural networks,are seen as black boxes due to the low interpretability of the values and interactions of intermediate neurons deep within the network. Such algorithms thus have low explainability and are not ideal for research, where the ultimate goal is not performance butrather acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of relation-ships between variables. Furthermore, a major challenge posed by multi-omics data, in particular, is the lack of generalizability of learned models due to the heterogeneity, high-dimensionality, 1KBR, Moffett Field, CA, USA.2NASA Space Life Sciences Training Program, Moffett Field, CA, USA.3College of Letters and Science, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA. 4Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA.5Monash Proteomics and Metabolomics Platform, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia.6Blue Marble Space, Seattle, WA, USA.7Abzu ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark.8Department of Marine Sciences, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.9Department of Kinesiology, Centre for Bone and Muscle Health, Brock University, St. Catharines, Canada.10These authors contributed equally: Kevin Li, Riya Desai.email: lauren.m.sandersnasa.gov; sylvain.v.costesnasa.govwww.nature.comnpjmgrav Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA1234567890():,;and low-sample-size (HDLSS) nature of the data. Highly expressive algorithms like neural networks will generate severely over t models when trained on HDLSS data6. With these criteria in mind, we chose to use a recently developed implementation of symbolic regression called QLattice,developed by Abzu ApS 7,8. Symbolic regression attempts to nd the true, concise mathematical function directly underlying the features relationship to the target, which is much more interpretable than neural network architectures and less likely toovert. It does this by representing mathematical expressions as computational graphs, where the nodes represent variables or functions, and by exploring the possible architectures for thesecomputational graphs. QLattice explores this graph space efciently to nd concise, interpretable, and accurate models, which make it a suitable tool for biomarker discovery 9. We aimed to identify molecular drivers of space ight effects on muscle physiology using space ight mouse muscle data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) withomics data found in GeneLab 10,11and Ca2reuptake data found in Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA)12.F i r s t ,w e trained QLattice to predict calcium reuptake levels of space-ight and ground control mice u sing multi-omics features (genes, proteins, etc.), a regre ssion task. Second, we trained QLattice to predict whether samples were from space ight or ground control mice, a classi cation task. We then identi ed features that contributed most to the predictive capabilities of the model s output by QLattice; these features (i.e., genes, proteins, or epigenetic markers) are potential biomarkers thatmay provide mechanistic insight behind the space ight- induced muscle physiology effects and serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.RESULTS Multi-omics biomarkers associated with space ight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by machine learning regression analysis Exposure to space ight has been previously reported to increase Ca 2uptake in mouse TA muscles and decrease Ca2uptake in mouse SOL muscles1. We hypothesized that this phenotypic change can be further understood by examining the relationships between genes, proteins, and methylation markers. Therefore, wetrained QLattice to identify multi-omics biomarkers predictive ofchanges in calcium reuptake capacity, using multi-omics datasetsfrom OSD-104 mouse SOL muscle and OSD-105 mouse TA musclefrom female C57BL6J mice own at 16 weeks of age on the RR-1 mission. For each muscle type, multi-omics data were combined and subject to dimensionality reduction prior to QLattice training,and calcium reuptake levels were used as a target (see Methodsand Supplementary Information). We matched RR-1 SOL multi-omics data with RR-1 SOL calcium data and RR-1 TA multi-omicsdata with RR-9 TA calcium data. In the latter case, note that RR-9 includes 10-week male mice while RR-1 includes 16-week female mice, but we hypothesized that the space ight muscle effect would be great enough to overcome these differences. Moredetails are provided in the Methods and SupplementaryInformation. In the TA regression analysis reported here (Fig. 1), we used both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics data. Weexcluded the methylation data because including it reducedQLattice performance while producing very similar results (seeSupplementary Information). The top two features predictive of Ca 2uptake rate were Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins (Fig. 1b). Representative models containing Acyp1 and Rps7 are shown inFig. 1a. These models consisted of bivariate Gaussian functions, bivariate multiply functions, and univariate tanh functions (see Fig. 1 QLattice regression analysis of TA multi-omics data and calcium uptake. a Representative examples of the mathematical relationships between multi-omic features identi ed by QLattice to predict calcium reuptake in TA muscle during LOOCV. bTop 9 features ranked by how many times they were used in a model found by QLattice during LOOCV. cT1 and T10 cross-validated R2scores, as well as the number of RNA-seq and proteomic features that were found among the top 50 features. dGene set enrichment analysis results using the top nine genes from the QLattice analysis.K. Li et al. 2 npj Microgravity (2023) 90 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA1234567890():,;Supplementary Information for additional discussion of model architectures). Of the 27 models containing Rps7, 24 included arelationship with Acyp1, possibly indicating a biological interac-tion between the two features that could be tested in the future through laboratory studies. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed signi cant enrichment of biological signaling involved in apopto- sis, endocytosis, and protein localization (Fig. 1d). In the SOL regression analysis, the best-performing models mainly displayed relationships between the expression of different genes on the RNA level, related by mathematical functions such asGaussian, linear, and exp (Fig. 2ac). We focused on the top 13 features across all models by rank, all of which were RNA-seq features: Gm35576, Rspo3, Gpc4, Klhl31, Sox6, Auts2, Sobp, Mdga1, Aox1, Tle4, Klhl33, Eepd1, Rhbdl3 , and Gm21955 . Gene set enrichment analysis revealed signi cant enrichment of biological signaling involved in cellular differentiation, synapse organization and assembly, and neuron migration (Fig. 2d). QLattice analysis identi ed 9 and 13 critical genes playing an important role in calcium reuptake of TA and SOL muscles, respectively, in the context of space ight-inducing muscle loss. Figure 3depicts the changes of expression level in FLT versus GC for some of these genes and their corresponding proteins (whenmeasurements are available) in both muscle types. Many of the genes identi ed have been described in the literature as playing a role in muscle recovery and we focus our attention on thesegenes. In the case of TA muscle, Acyp1 protein was found in 89 models. Acyp1 has been shown to inhibit the activity of Ca2 transporters in non-phospholamban-associated calcium-dependent ATPases,such as SERCA-1, which is predominantly found in fast-twitch muscle bers, the dominant ber type in the TA muscle 1315.I n line with this, Acyp1 protein expression is negatively correlatedwith calcium reuptake in QLattice models for TA muscles(Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating that high levels of Acyp1 are associated with low calcium reuptake ef ciency AUC. Consistent with previous studies 1, FLT TA samples exhibit lower Acyp1protein expression and improved calcium reuptake (Fig. 3a, e). Interestingly, Acyp1 gene expression in TA has a much greater spread across samples resulting in no signi cant difference between FLT and GC (Fig. 3b), possibly indicating a more reliable measurement from proteomics than RNA-seq. Furthermore, Acyp1 has been shown to enhance the activity of Ca2 transporters in phospholamban-associated calcium- ATPases, including SERCA-2a, which is predominantly found in slow-twitch bers, the dominant ber type in SOL muscle. We examined whether this pattern is consistent in the OSD-104 SOLmulti-omics data and discovered that Acyp1 gene expression was also downregulated in SOL FLT relative to GC (Fig. 3c), while calcium reuptake was impaired in SOL as previously reported 1(Fig. 3g). Note that QLattice was not trained to nd this association for SOL muscle. Such a nding is, therefore, quite strong, suggesting a potential mechanism. The observed downregulation in Acyp1 could contribute to impairments in SERCA function found in theFLT SOL, as it is known that phospholamban is highly expressed inthis muscle and is less expressed in fast glycolytic muscles. Taken together, these ndings suggest that Acyp1 may play a mechanistic role in the dysregulation of calcium induced byspace ight (Fig. 3d, f), but additional research is necessary to establish this relationship. The second key protein identi ed in TA muscle was Rps7. This gene is known to be downregulated by nitrosative stress 16, which is related to impaired calcium reuptake1. Consistent with this, Rps7 is positively correlated with calcium reuptake capacity ef ciency in the QLattice models (negatively associated with calcium reuptakeAUC; Supplementary Fig. 9). This suggests a potential role for Rps7in the calcium reuptake response to nitrosative stress. No nitrosative stress was reported in the TA samples from the original study 1, suggesting that mechanisms possibly including Rps7 may have enhanced the calcium reuptake ef ciency. Further studies would be required to establish these relationships. The QLattice analysis for SOL revealed a very distinct set of genes (Fig. 2b). This is, however, not surprising as only gene Fig. 2 QLattice regression analysis of SOL multi-omics data and calcium uptake. a Representative examples of the mathematical relationships between multi-omic features identi ed by QLattice to predict calcium reuptake in SOL muscle during LOOCV. bTop 13 features ranked by how many times they were used in a model found by QLattice during LOOCV. cT1 and T10 cross-validated R2scores, as well as the number of RNA-seq and methylation features that were found among the top 50 features. dGene set enrichment analysis results using the top 13 genes from the QLattice analysis.K. Li et al. 3 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2023) 90 expression and methylation data were available. Several of these genes are already known for their relationship to calcium reuptakeefciency and muscle response to injury, and their levels are plotted for protein expression (when available) and geneexpression in both TA and SOL muscle in Fig. 3ac.Gpc4 is underexpressed in injury-activated muscle satellite cells 17; simi- larly, Tle4 is normally underexpressed following muscle injury to allow myogenesis18. In our data, both Tle4 and Gpc4 were upregulated in mouse FLT SOL (Fig. 3a, b), which displayed impaired calcium reuptake vs. GC SOL (Fig. 3g). This may indicate that failure of proper Gpc4 and Tle4 downregulation may play a role in damaged calcium reuptake, possibly by lowering overallmuscle quality. This is supported by previous RNA-seq datashowing that genes involved with myogenesis and differentiationwere downregulated in the FLT SOL from mice 19. Alternatively, Tle4 expression is known to be triggered by calcium signaling20,s o the observed Tle4 upregulation may instead be the result of increased cytoplasmic calcium levels due to impaired reuptake.Further, Rspo3 has been found to be one of the most upregulated genes after SOL training and is associated with adecrease in muscle atrophy 21, and its knockout has shown to compromise myogenesis and myotube differentiation22. Similarly, mice lacking Klhl31 exhibit stunted skeletal muscle growth, centronuclear myopathy, and SR dilation23. In our data, both Rspo3 and Klhl31 are also upregulated in SOL FLT samples with lower calcium reuptake ability (Fig. 3c), possibly as a compensa- tory or adaptive mechanism to increased calcium levels due todecreased uptake 24. Multi-omics biomarkers associated with space ight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by ML classi cation analysis We then hypothesized that there may be other molecular pathways affected by space ight in mouse muscle that could be identi ed through feature relationships in QLattice models. Therefore, we broadened the scope of our analysis to identify Fig. 3 Geneprotein relationship with calcium reuptake in SOL and TA muscles and putative mechanism.

Li et al. 4 npj Microgravity (2023) 90 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAmulti-omics features that were predictive of the FLT or GC groups rather than restricting to a single phenotype. We used QLattice to classify FLT samples from GC and assessed the resulting modelsand feature interactions. In the TA classi cation analysis, we used all 3 types of omics data: RNA-seq, proteomics, and methylation data (Fig. 4ac). The top 11 features from this analysis included all 3 types of features: Trak2 (RNA-seq), Tle4 (RNA-seq), Tspan4 (RNA-seq), Actin (Proteo- mic), Gm22281 (Methylation), Sell(RNA-seq), Ech1 (Methylation), Fhod1 (RNA-seq), Egr2 (RNA-seq), Klhl21 (RNA-seq), and Lrp2bp (RNA-seq). In keeping with our hypothesis, gene set enrichment analysis revealed signi cant enrichment of pathways relevant to muscle biology and the neuromuscular response to stress, includingskeletal muscle cell differentiation, positive regulation of myelina-tion, and Schwann cell differentiation (Fig. 4d). Interestingly, multiple pathways involved mitochondrial regulation, which hasbeen previously identi ed as a molecular response to space ight in multiple tissues including muscle 25. The pathway analysis also uncovered perturbation of actin and myosin structural regulation. The actin protein was the topproteomics feature found across QLattice models (Fig. 4b) and was upregulated in TA FLT samples (Fig. 5a). Actin is a key component in the myo bril bundles which generate muscle contractions after Ca 2release and signaling26. Further, the top RNA-seq feature Trak2 is known to enable myosin binding activity for muscle contraction27.Trak2 is also involved in the Rho GTPase cycle, which plays an important role in muscle mass regeneration andmyobrillogenesis 27. The Trak2 gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig. 5b), possibly as a muscle regeneration mechanism in a weightless environment. Tle4, the second highest occurring RNA-seq feature across all QLattice models, acts as a corepressor regulating muscle cell differentiation18. The Tle4 gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig. 5b), possibly dueto the lack of a need for skeletal muscle growth in a weightless environment. Interestingly, both Trak2 and Tle4 displayed some co-occurrence with Actin. Out of the 20 models that Trak2 appeared in, 4 of them contained Actin, while out of the 14 models containing Tle4,2o f them contained Actin. This may indicate a co-regulation networkbetween Actin structural muscle activity and muscle massregeneration and cell differentiation in response to space ight, which could be further investigated in laboratory studies. In the SOL classi cation analysis, RNA-seq gene features comprised 69 out of the 80 features across all resulting models (Fig. 6ac). The top 9 recurrent features were Fam220a ,Lrp4, Osgin2 ,Gm29686, Gm22281 (Methylation), Sema6c ,Alpk3 ,Tmod1 , and Bcam . For the most part, these features appeared in single- feature models related to the FLTGC outcome by a linear, log, orinverse relationship. Of the 120 total models, 18 describedrelationships between 2 features. Interestingly, 11 of these were pairs of methylation and RNA-seq features, indicating a potential cooperative relationship between gene expression and DNAmethylation in space ight SOL muscle response. Similar to the calcium reuptake prediction analysis, the SOL FLT GC classi cation analysis mainly identi ed models with interac- tions between RNA-seq gene features. Gene set enrichmentanalysis of the top 11 features revealed enrichment of pre- andpost-synaptic membrane assembly and organization (Fig. 6d), in keeping with previous research showing structural alterations in muscle synaptic organization in space ight 28. DISCUSSION Here we report the identi cation of multi-omics biomarkers in mouse SOL or TA muscle that are predictive of change in calciumreuptake capacity during space ight or broadly predictive of molecular changes in space ight samples compared to ground Fig. 4 QLattice classi cation analysis of TA multi-omics data and FLTGC groups. a Representative examples of the mathematical relationships between multi-omic features identi ed by QLattice to predict FLT versus GC in TA muscle during LOOCV. bTop 11 features ranked by how many times they were used in a model found by QLattice during LOOCV. cT1 and T10 cross-validated R2scores, as well as the total number of RNA-seq, proteomics, and methylation features across all models. dGene set enrichment analysis results using the top 11 features from the QLattice analysis.K. Li et al. 5 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2023) 90 control. Our study is a key contribution to the eld both in the identi cation of these biomarkers and in that we demonstrate the utility of ML methodology for biomarker discovery in spacebiology by using the QLattice symbolic regression method to characterize biomarker relationships to each other and to the predictive target. Instead of using the traditional systems biologyapproach, ML methods provide unbiased identi cation of potential candidates for biological mechanisms. Our study is also one of the rst to analyze combined multi-omics and non-omics phenotypic data from the NASA OSDR, leveraging the relationaldatabase structure, which allows for mapping samples across assays and missions. Appropriate regulation of muscular cytoplasmic calcium levels is key for several downstream calcium-dependent signaling path-ways. Calcium reuptake is reportedly improved in TA muscle but impaired in SOL muscle, during space ight 1, with limited under- standing of the molecular signaling causing these phenotypicchanges. Here, we report that enhanced Ca 2uptake in FLT TA is directly related to the combined interaction of Acyp1 protein downregulation and Rps7 protein upregulation; while decreased Ca2uptake in FLT SOL is related to interactions of upregulation of several different pairs of genes, including Gpc4 ,Tle4,Rspo3 , and Klhl31 . The lower Ca2uptake in FLT SOL is also correlated with signi cant weight loss for the SOL muscle in the RR1 ight samples ( t-test p-value  0.05); whereas there is no signi cant change in weight for TA muscles (Table 1). Overall, the analysis provided here suggests that TA muscles are more resilient to space conditions, and Acyp1 and Rps7 seem to be goodcandidates to counteract weight losses and poor Ca 2uptake observed in SOL muscles. On the technological aspect of this work, we show that one of the major advantages of QLattice compared to traditional multi-omics or differential gene expression analysis methods is its ability to elucidate a variety of mathematical interactions, not necessarilylinear, between different multi-omics features. We noted a varietyof mathematical functions in the QLattice models from our analysis, including bivariate Gaussian, bivariate multiply, univariate tanh, addition, multiplication, and log. The response plotsprovided by QLattice help translate the mathematical functionsinto biological and mechanistic interpretations (Supplementary Fig. 9). We noted that when Gaussian functions are reported, only therst half of the Gaussian curve is being used to t a sigmoidal trend (Supplementary Fig. 9). Biologically, we interpret this to be because biological quantities (e.g., calcium concentration) cannot be negative, nor cannot exceed a certain threshold (e.g., the totalamount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum). Thus,linear models would actually fail to extrapolate in these more extreme ends of the quantity s range, while sigmoidal models would t much more accurately. To further improve the predictive capability of this tool, it would be valuable to further characterizethe relationship between the mathematical functions identi ed by QLattice and the distribution of protein concentrations in various tissues. Such characteristics would help further translate theinteractions of the various functions found in QLattice with an actual biological process between different key components of a tissue. While additional study is needed to fully characterize the relationships identi ed here by QLattice, we suggest that QLattice s emphasis on concise, interpretable models makes it an especially appropriate ML methodology for research applica-tions where explainability is key. Biomedical research, andespecially space biology research, presents the additional challenge of small sample sizes, which usually leads to severe overtting and a lack of generalizability in the models found by Fig. 5 Expression levels of top proteins and genes identi ed by QLattice TA and SOL classi cation analysis and muscle weights. aQLattice key protein levels in TA. bQLattice key gene levels in TA. cQLattice key gene levels in SOL.

Li et al. 6 npj Microgravity (2023) 90 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASAconventional ML algorithms. This issue is at least partially addressed by QLattice s predisposition to limit the architectural complexity of models (which has a strong regularizing effect), aswell as its heavy intrinsic feature selection based on mutual information with the target variable. A valuable future study would be to characterize the relationship between the individualdata modalities and the overall multi-omics results. As demonstrated in this study, when an ML method properly accounts for these challenges and priorities speci c to space biology research, it can provide signi cant guidance for what to focus on in future research. Although the top biomarkers fromQLattice must be further characterized and con rmed, the method has appreciably narrowed the research search space  by directing us toward groups of biomarkers that are mostpromising. In this way, explainable and interpretable ML, with its advantage over humans in being able to process huge featurespaces, serves as a metaphorical metal detector, telling us where we should start digging. The results we report here would bene t from future experimental validation studies. We conclude with our observations on the contributions of the different types of omics data to the QLattice predictive models. Inthis work, DNA methylation CpG features, when mapped to gene names or when maintained as genomic coordinates, failedto greatly contribute to model architectures and resulted in lowerpredictive performance. We suggest that this may be becausemethylation marks are deposited over time, so molecular changesduring space ight are primarily dominated by functional changes, while small but persistent epigenetic changes may be bettercaptured upon return to earth. To test this hypothesis, futurestudies could capture methylation measurements both before andafter space ight from the same animals. In accordance with this hypothesis, both protein and gene expression changes were the most predictive features, with the top proteomic features muchstronger and more cohesive than those of top RNA-seq features.This may constitute support in favor of focusing on proteomicanalysis over RNA-seq analysis in future space ight studies, as the relationship between proteins and function is more immediatecompared to the presumably noisier relationship betweentranscripts and function.

Li et al. 7 Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA npj Microgravity (2023) 90 Taken together, our results build on previous work in the eld by reporting a promising demonstration of an explainable ML method for space biology research and providing several potential biomarkers for future study on muscle response to space ight. METHODS RNA sequencing data (RR-1 SOL and TA muscles female) For RNA-seq RR-1 data, we started with the raw count les available on OSDR from the GeneLab RNA-seq processing pipeline29.W e ltered out lowly expressed genes with unreliable reads (i.e., we only kept genes that had at least 10 non-zero readsin at least 3 samples), resulting in a reduction of dimensionality from 55,536 genes to 15,848 genes for OSD-104 and 16,660 genes for OSD-105, with an overlap of 15,216 genes between the twodatasets (Supplementary Fig. 5g). We then applied a variance- stabilizing transformation (VST) using DESeq2 v1.34.0 30, which corrected for library sizesequencing depth and mitigatedheteroskedasticity and skewed distributions. The mean-variance relationship and count distribution were checked post- normalization to con rm the effectiveness of preprocessing (Supplementary Fig. 1a d, Supplementary Fig. 3a d). Within- and across-group gene expression variance distributions show greater variance spread for the FLT samples than the GC samples(Supplementary Fig. 5a f). Proteomics data (RR-1 TA muscle only female) The proteomics data for OSD-105 was collected in two runs of TMT- labeled mass spectrometry with a bridge channel in each run consisting of a pooled sample of all FLT and GC samples 31.T oe n s u r e values were comparable when combining the runs, we used the ratio of expression values for each sample relative to that of the corresponding bridge channel. After combining the data from theruns, we performed a log2 transform ation of the expression values, ltered out proteins with too many missing values, and applied VST normalization, all using the DEP v1.16.0R package 32. Again, the mean-variance relationship and di stribution were checked (Supple- mentary Fig. 1e, f, Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). We then imputed missing data using K-nearest neighbor imputation, which did notsignicantly affect the distribution (Supplementary Fig. 4a, c). Finally, we removed any remaining batch effects between the two runs that were ampli ed through the preprocessing steps using methods from the limma v3.50.3R package, which are appropriate to apply on properly transformed proteomics data 33. The removal of batch effects was con rmed using paired PCA plots of the top principal components (PCs) (Supplementary Fig. 4b, d). The preprocessed dataset contained 1786 proteins. Bisulte sequencing data (RR-1 SOL and TA muscle female) Raw bisul te sequencing FASTQ les were processed using the Nextow nf-core methylseq pipeline (v1.6.1), which uses the Bismark aligner for genome alignment and extracting methylation calls (Supplementary Fig. 2a)34,35. The processed data were ltered to only CpG-type methylated sites, as non-CpG methylation isusually restricted to a few speci c cell types (e.g., pluripotent stem cells, glial cells, neurons) that are not as relevant in this context (Supplementary Fig. 2b d) 36. The methylation sites were then mapped to their corresponding genes. For each methylation site, we found the gene whose chromosomal range included the site. Methylation sites that didn t fall into annotated gene regions were discarded, as the current study focuses on mechanistic relation- ships between coding features. We then calculated the percen- tage of CpG sites in each gene that was methylated (methylation). There were 48,368 and 47,660 methylation features for OSD-104 and OSD-105, respectively, after preprocessing (distributions shown in Supplementary Fig. 4e, f). Weexperimented with using site-level methylation features instead of gene-level methylation features, but this resulted in severe overtting of ML models. The remaining methylation features overlap with the majority of the genes measured in the RNA-seqdatasets, although a majority of the methylation loci do not map to an RNA-seq gene (Supplementary Fig. 5g). In order to assess whether the loci with the highest percent methylation are relatedto the genes with the lowest expression, as would be expected mechanistically, we compared the top 10 methylated genes with the bottom 10 expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 5h). Thereis some limited overlap but less than would be expected considering the overlap of all genes and methylated loci. Calcium reuptake data (RR-1 SOL female, RR-9 TA male) Calcium reuptake data was acquired from OSDR dataset OSD- 488 37, which contains rates of Ca2 uptake in the muscle homogenates measured in a 96-well plate using the Indo-1 Ca2  uorophore1. These values were collected as a time series, with the measurements of cytoplasmic calcium concentrations taken atmultiple points in time during a period of muscle relaxation. For our analysis, we use the area under the curve (AUC) as a measurement of calcium reuptake change over time. A lower AUCvalue implies more ef cient calcium reuptake. For this study, we did not have multi-omics and calcium uptake measurements from the same animals. Therefore, for comparing omics and calcium uptake data, we assigned calcium reuptake values to omics samples based on perturbation analysis to identifythe optimal pairing (see Supplementary Information, Supplemen- tary Fig. 8). It is well characterized that there are signi cant physiological and molecular differences between muscle samplesfrom space ight and ground samples 1,2. We inferred that this difference would be greater than within-group differences in mission, age, and sex and would allow us to identify thespace ight effect relationship between omics features and calcium uptake. Speci cally, the SOL calcium reuptake measure- ments were collected from age- and sex-matched mice from thesame RR-1 cohort as the OSD-104 SOL omics data. There was no TA calcium reuptake measurement done in the RR-1 cohort; the OSD-488 dataset only had TA calcium reuptake measurementscollected from 10-week-old male mice own on the RR-9 mission. We, therefore, paired the TA muscles calcium reuptake from these 10-week-old male mice with the OSD-105 TA multi-omics data,which are from older females. Model hyperparameters The primary hyperparameters for QLattice ( feyn package v3.0.2) were the number of epochs and the maximum complexity of the architectures. The number of epochs corresponded to the numberof generations for the evolutionary search algorithm as a whole rather than the number of epochs of backpropagation for any individual model architecture being explored. We tried variousvalues for the number of epochs between 10 and 100, but there were no signi cant differences in validation performance or feature rankings. The maximum architectural complexity wasrestricted to 4 (2 features and 2 functional interactions) for the SOL analysis since SOL data had two data types, and we were interested in modeling the interactions between the data types.Similarly, the maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 6 for the TA analysis. Statistical analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Enrichr implementation in the gseapy library (v0.10.4) in Python, using GO_Biological_Process_2021 as the background gene set. Box- plots were generated using seaborn (v0.11.2) in Python, with statistical annotations calculated using the statannotationsK.

DATA AVAILABILITY The datasets used in this study were collected from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR- 1) and 9 (RR-9) missions and are publicly available on the NASA OSDR (osdr.nasa.gov).RR-1 samples were from female C57BL6 J mice own at 16 weeks of age for 37 days. RR-9 samples were from male C57BL6 J mice own at 10 weeks of age for 35 days. Speci cally, we used datasets OSD-104 (RR-1 multi-omics mouse SOL data) 31, OSD- 105 (RR-1 multi-omics mouse TA data)38, and OSD-488 (RR-1 and RR-9 calcium reuptake data)37. OSD-104 dataset consists of bulk RNA-seq and bisul te sequencing DNA methylation data for SOL muscle samples collected from 6 space- own mice (FLT) and 6 ground control mice (GC) during the RR-1 mission38. OSD-105 dataset consists of bulk RNA-seq, bisul te sequencing DNA methylation, and mass- spectrometry-based proteomics data for TA muscle samples, also collected from 6 FLT and 6 GC mice during RR-131. OSD-488 dataset1,37originates from a study consisting of calcium reuptake data from female SOL muscle samples collected from4 FLT and 4 GC during the RR-1 mission; 10 FLT and 10 GC of SOL and TA malemuscle samples during the RR-9 mission.
