Mason2, Peter Grabham29,33 Afshin Beheshti30,31,33 Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with space ight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop counter- measure treatments to mitigate the da mage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatm ent. We performed RNA-s equencing and tran- scriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel c ell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without theantagonists to three microRNAs: miR- 16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p ( i.e., antagomirs). Signi c a n tr e d u c t i o no fi n ammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mito chondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from as tronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA mission s, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our nd- ings indicate a countermeasure strate gy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in space ight missions to mitigate space radiation damage. The perils of human space exploration span the gamut of exposure to space radiation, altered gravity elds, and prolonged isolation in a hostileclosed environment1. The profound effects on human health may include bone and muscle atrophy, increased intracranial pressure,enhanced risk of developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, andimpaired neurocognitive functions 2. These physical and psychological stressors present a major concern for maintaining the overall health of space ight crews. The biological consequences of space ight alsopresent a unique opportunity to analyze aspects of natural and disease pathologies that occur terrestrially35. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) critically impact cell non- autonomous regulation of post-transcriptional processes, can beused as biomarkers 6,7, and are associated with human diseases810.W e have extensively characterized a circulating miRNA signature asso- ciated with the space environment using biomedical samples from astronauts, in vivo rodent models, in vitro cellular models, and 3DReceived: 19 December 2022 Accepted: 17 May 2024 Check for updates A full list of af liations appears at the end of the paper. e-mail: pwg2cumc.columbia.edu ;afshin.beheshtibmsis.org Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 11234567890():,; 1234567890():,;human-derived cell cultures under simulated and real space exposure1114. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated expression of candidate miRNAs were altered in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thy-mus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle from space- own animal models 11and revealed a conserved miRNA signature between rodents and humans13. The altered miRNA signature discovered after exposure to space irradiation was predicted to affect the cardiovas-cular system and was widely associated with mitochondrialdysfunction 13. Treatment of 3D microvessel cell cultures with miRNA inhibitors (referred to as antagomirs) targeting three of these miR-NAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, prevented microvesselcollapse 13and rescued the inhibition of angiogenesis15caused by space radiation exposure. Multi-omic analyses of biomedical pro l e so fa s t r o n a u t sa l o n g with several hundred space-related data points showed that major shifts in mitochondrial gene expression may be central to space ight- associated health risks12. Mitochondria are responsible for metabolic activity through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and mito-chondrial dysfunction decreases energy availability, alters cellularmetabolism, and leads to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and muscularand neurological disorders 16. Here, a 3D model for human microvessels is used to explore the cellular biology consequences of miRNA inhibition, particularlyfocusing on how the endothelial cell layer may be involved withcardiovascular damage. We nd that antagomir treatment reduces DNA damage induced by space radiation, and is associated with improved stress responses at the molecular and morphological levels. Furthermore, we con rm the speci c targets of the miRNAs in astronaut samples from the NASA Twin Study 17, a JAXA mission18, and therst civilian commercial space ight mission, Inspiration4 (I4)19. Our results suggest that these miRNAs may be targeted as counter-measures to alter cellular signaling pathways to mitigate space ight damage and reduce human health risks in human space ight missions. Results Combined antagomir inhibition is effective in counteracting space radiation damage We investigated the cellular alterations associated with the protective roles of three antagomirs targeting miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p in a 3D human microvasculature model. Firstly, we examined theeffect of individual miRNAs to mitigate structural damage caused byspace radiation exposure from simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR).The morphology of mature microvessels representing post-mitoticcells with characteristics of the endothelial barrier (tight junctions) waspreserved by inhibiting any of the three key miRNAs (Fig. 1a, c). A single dose of each individual antagomir 24 h before GCR irradiation wassufcient to protect microvessels although the combination of the three was more effective. Furthermore, the inhibition by each miRNA was comparable to the unirradiated controls. A similar result was found for the longer multistage develop- ment of microvessels undergoing angiogenesis. In this model, cellswere exposed to GCR on culture day 1, when they were still indivi-dual and not connected; while the irradiation effects were seen onday 6, when the endothelial cells should have been formed intomature microvessels (Fig. 1b, c). Individual antagomirs applied on days 2 and 3 restore angiogenesis at levels comparable to controls,and combined antagomirs exert an improved protective role(Fig. 1b). In both models, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p are similarly effective at counteracting the effects of space radiation, but the antagomir combination inhibition of the three miRNAs provides a stronger and more robust response. Hereafter, we focuson the biological changes occurring when inhibiting all threemiRNAs.Combined antagomir inhibition protects microvessels from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by space radiation While the biological consequences of GCR exposure on mature and developing microvessels are clearly observed 24 h and 7 days after irradiation, respectively, examination of earlier endpoints would enable us to understand the impact of antagomir treatment. Since DNAis the primary target damaged by radiation, early effects from miRNAinhibition on DNA damage and repair were investigated. As the repair of DNA DSB damage by space radiation is pivotal for cellular function, we assessed the cellular proteins involved in DNADSB repair targeted by miRNA inhibition. Many of the DNA DSB repairgenes are common targets of the miRNAs as shown by a networkrepresentation for the perturbation effects of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p,and let-7a-5p (Fig. 2a). These results suggest that miRNAs play an important role in activating the DNA DSB repair pathways induced by GCR irradiation. To determine the molecular mechanism through which the antagomirs protect mature and developing microvessels from theeffects of GCR, we studied the accumulation of DNA DSBs and theactivation of DNA repair pathways. Immunocytochemical staining forthe tumor suppressor p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) was quanti ed following antagomir treatment 90 min after GCR irradiation (Fig. 2b). The 53BP1 protein accumulates at the site DNA DSBs after irradiation,and the resulting repair foci can be measured as a critical platform forDNA DSB repair activity 20. The peak DNA repair foci often occurs around 30 min after gamma irradiation and our previous publications showed that foci induced by charged particles decline over several hours in the human microvasculature model21. Our current analysis shows a signi cant increase in DNA DSB repair foci (Fig. 2b). In con- trast, the antagomir treatment signi cantly decreased the number of foci to levels similar to the unirradiated condition. This demonstratesthat the antagomirs protect microvasculature cells from DNA DSBscaused by space radiation at much earlier times due to potentiallyproviding a more ef cient DNA repair mechanism. The changes in expression of miRNAs after GCR exposure and its relationship to DNA repair mechanisms is not widely understood 22.T o determine if DNA DSBs are associated with a global response from those evolutionarily conserved miRNAs that we observed in vivo, we exposed C57BL6 female mice to 0.5 Gy of GCR and performed miRNA-sequencing on the plasma, liver, soleus muscle, and heart (Fig. 2c, d). From pathway analysis 23of DNA DSB and repair pathways, we observed a comprehensive increase in DNA DSB genesets across all four tissuesfrom the measured changes in miRNA expression. The global increaseassociated with overall miRNA activity following GCR irradiation fur-ther supports the key roles of these miRNAs in the DNA DSB repairpathways. Space radiation reveals key regulation of the three miRNAs in speci c tissues To further establish miRNA changes after space radiation and the importance of miR-16, miR-125b, and let-7a with cardiovascular healthrisks, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis(WGCNA) on the miRNA-seq data from the mice exposed to 0.5 Gy ofGCR (Fig. 3) 24. WGCNA classically was designed for transcriptomic RNA-seq data, but recently has proven its utility in miRNA-seq data25,26. Hence, we utilized WGCNA to determine key miRNA networks that areimpacted by space radiation and how they are affected in the heart,liver, soleus muscle, and plasma of mice. The WGCNA analysis revealedthree distinct miRNA networks (i.e., Modules orME ) that are most strongly impacted by GCR radiation, depending on the tissue type (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 3ac). Interestingly, for all three Mod- ules the heart tissue showed the most signi cant decrease comparing GCR irradiated mice to sham (Fig. 3ac). For Module 0 (Figs. 3a) and 2 (Fig. 3c), the liver shows a signi cant increase. When observing the keyArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 2miRNAs involved in each module we see that let-7a-5p is present in Module 0 (Fig. 3d), miR-16-5p in Module 1 (Fig. 3e), and miR-15b-5p in Module 2 (Fig. 3f). The individual miRNAs within each Module were differential expressed due to GCR radiation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Rescue of space radiation damage with inhibition of key miRNAs associated with cardiovascular space radiation damage Based on our intriguing results showing complete protection of the 3D human microvessel cell cultures post GCR irradiation by the inhibitionof three miRNAs, we further investigated the key biological processes involved. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on themature microvessel and angiogenesis models after 0.5 Gy of GCRexposure and compared conditions with or without the combination of antagomirs (Fig. 4). The experimental design for the antagomir treatment is depicted in Fig. 4a. The antagomir treatment and end- points after irradiation differ between the two models as described inMalkani et al. 13for the mature microvessel model and Wuu et al.15for the angiogenesis model.

Overall, antagomir treated samples post-irradiation clustered closer to the sham unirradiated samples for both microvessel cell cultures(Fig. 4b). This indicates that the antagomir treatment had a substantial impact on restoring gene expression back to normal levels. Of note, weare utilizing p-value statistics for our main analysis and acknowledge that this may result in the potential of more false positives, but webelieve that the information generated by lowering the statistical sig-nicance will produce more meaningful data and previous literature also provided further justi cation when necessary to utilize p- values 27,28. In addition, we have also provided the adj. p-value analysis for full transparency of our results (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although the global clustering of both models demonstrates a restoration closer to the basal levels, there are measurable differences between the two models with GCR irradiation alone and GCR with theantagomirs. This is apparent when observing the transcriptomic pat-terns for the signi cantly regulated genes (Fig. 4c). GCR irradiation caused a greater number of genes to be differentially regulated for themature vessel compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 4d, e). Antagomir treatment during irradiation in mature (before) or in angiogenesis cells (after) caused signi cant dysregulation in both models (Fig. 4d, e). Substantially more genes were uniquely altered in the angiogenesis compared to the mature microvessel model (Fig. 4f), as may be expected since the endpoint is much longer than in themature microvessel model and encompasses multiple stages ofdevelopment. We also identi ed a set of orphan genes to be differentially regulated in GCR-stressed samples and reversed by antagomirtreatment. Orphan genes code for proteins that are unique to aspecies 2931and may provide a major source of evolutionary novelty conferring bene cial traits to a species. Evidence-based (EB) orphan genes were identi ed by Singh32based on a comprehensive analysis of 27,000 RNA-Seq datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project. To determine how humanorphan genes respond to space radiation and antagomir treatment,differential expression of orphan genes was assessed in the RNA-seqdata. In both models, tens of orphan genes were differentially Fig. 2  Quanti cation of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair foci with antagomir treatment and miRNA pathway analysis. a Network representation for the DNA DSB repair gene targets for miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a-5pgenerated by ClueGO in Cytoscape.

Since orphan genes often integrate themselves into metabolic and regulatorynetworks 31,33,34, these could play a role in the dysregulation of DNA repair and metabolic pathways associated with response to spaceradiation and antagomir treatment observed here. To better identify dysregulated genes targeted by the antagomirs, we used miRNA target analysis by the mirDIP algorithm 35to assess transcripts downregulated by irradiation but restored after antagomirtreatment. Twenty-one gene targets, including PDPR ,APAF1 ,XPO6 , NIBAN1 ,a n d SLC7A1 , were predicted to be simultaneous targets of each miRNA (Fig. 5a). To validate the key genes, we performed PCR on 8 of the 21 genes from the same isolated RNA utilized for the RNA-seq(Fig. 5b). We see that all the genes are in agreement with the RNA-seq data except for MSH5 , which we see an upregulation with 0.5 Gy and then the expression returns back to 0 Gy levels after antagomir treat-ment. We investigated how well the miRNAs bound to the 21 genetargets ( antagomir-rescued genes ), and the log 2fold change from the RNA-seq data after GCR exposure. We observed that the three miRNAs bound to the 3 -UTR and CDS regions of 15 (Fig. 5c) and 13 (Fig. 5d) out of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes, respectively, whereas let-7a-5p andmiR-125b-5p bound only to two of the target genes (Fig. 5e). To survey the ef cacy of the three miRNAs to downregulate the 21 gene targets, we analyzed RNA-seq fold change values from differentexperimental conditions using cumulative plots 36see Methods). Fig- ure5f shows that the 21 antagomir-rescued genes with 7-8mer 3 -UTR sites had a signi cant propensity to be downregulated compared to those without 3 -UTR sites ( P 4.99e 07, 2.65e 32 and 6.31e 09 for 8mer, 7mer-m8 and 7mer-A1, respectively, using theKolmogorov Smirnov test). These results indicate that miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p play a ke y role in the downregulation of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes. Figure 5g, h shows that the down- regulation of these genes is drastically reduced under antagomirtreatment, indicating that by inhibiting these 3 miRNAs, expression ofthese genes reverts towards the control (0 Gy) levels. Pathway analysis of the antagomir-restored transcripts targeted by one or more of the three miRNA shows an enrichment pattern forexpression of genes associated with apoptosis and TP53-mediated celldeath, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immuneresponse, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids(Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, alteration of these pathways mayaccount for the observed preservation of the 3D microvessels byantagomir treatment with GCR exposure. To con rm that these 21 genes are actual targets for the three miRNAs we dissected the pathways involved with the mirDIP algo-rithm analysis and also provided experimental evidence from cur-rent databases and literature. While mirDIP draws from acomprehensive pool of 24 databases to evaluate miRNA targets 35, Fig. 3  MiRNA based weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on different organs from GCR irradiated mice.

Additionally, we corroborated the experi- mental validation of these gene targets by cross-referencing datafrom three databases (i.e. miRTarBase 37, TarBase38, and starBase39) alongside pertinent literature references (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Table 1). Our results indicate robust experimental validation of gene targets for the three miRNAs as follows: 10 out of 10 for miR-16-5p, 13 out of 14 for let-7a-5p, and 9 out of 15 for miR-125b-5p. It s worth noting that while the validation rate for miR-125b-5p stands at 60based on these databases, certain contextual conditions mayinuence the validation of gene targets for miRNAs. Nevertheless,our additional experimental evidence (Fig. 5bh) enhances the condence in our ndings. Finally, it is crucial to assess the conservation of these three miRNAs between humans and mice. It is well-established that miRNAsexhibit high levels of conservation across species, particularly betweenmice and humans 40. Our analysis demonstrates 100 conservation of all three mature miRNAs (i.e. miR-16-5p, miR-125p-5p, and let-7a-5p) and their precursor forms have conservation rates greater than 95between mouse and human genomes (Fig. 5j). Given the robust con- servation observed, comparisons between results obtained in mouseand human contexts can be easily facilitated.

The NASA Twin Study has been described in several papers which compared two identical twinswith one Twin on the ISS for 340 days and the other twin on Earth 12,17. The JAXA study conducted RNA-seq on plasma cell-free RNAs from sixastronauts who were on the International Space Station (ISS) for120 days, sampled from pre- ight, during ight, and post- ight time points. The I4 mission performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) onthe blood and also RNA-seq skin biop sies which involved 4 astronauts (two males and two females) that orbited at low Earth orbit (LEO) at 590 km above the atmosphere (Fig. 6f). The I4 mission occurred at a much higher altitude than the ISS, t hus the I4 astronauts experienced a higher accumulated dose of radiation compared to being on the ISS. Itis important to note that the estimated accumulated doses of spaceradiation that the astronauts were exposed to for these missions werelower than 0.5 Gy (which is the estimated dose for a trip to Mars and back), but despite this we still observed key changes as we will describebelow. The following are the accumulated doses that were measuredfor each mission: NASA Twin Study astronaut received 146.34 mSv or 14.634 cGy 17, I4 astronauts received 4.72 mSv or 0.472 cGy19,a n df o r the JAXA astronauts we estimated that they had received an accumu-lated dose of 51.60 mSv or 5.16 cGy (the dosimetry was not reportedfor this mission and this is an estimate based on the average dosereceived per month from other missions) 18. Using RNA-seq data from the NAS A Twin Study, we analyzed the expression of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes over four different cir-culating cell populations with the Twin onboard the ISS for 340 days:CD4 T cells (Fig. 6a), CD8 T cells (Fig. 6b), CD19 B cells (Fig. 6c), and a lymphocyte depleted cell population which will represent the mono-cytes (Fig. 6d). There are individual gene variations observed from preight to the last time point after return (i.e. R  200 days), but the overall gene signature changes will indicate how these genes will be impacted by the three miRNAs. The global changes for these 21 genesover time is best observed with cumulative plots for the different celltypes for the Twin in space over ti me (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Fig.7a).

We show that for ight vs pre- ight and R  1 vs pre- ight (i.e. immediately after return to Earth) there was signi cant downregulation for these key genes and then at 34 days and beyond, the genes have returned back to thecontrol pre- ight expression.To establish the direct relationship between the 21 gene targets and the three miRNAs, we utilized the NASA Twin Study which had both miRNA- and mRNA-seq data associated with the mission and cell types. Similar to the cumulative plots, we observed the correlationbetween the three miRNAs (i.e. miR-16, let-7a, and miR-125b) with the21 gene targets in the four different cell types (i.e. CD4, CD8, CD19, and Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 8monocytes) (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We correlated with the over- lapping time points per each sample type and observed for the majority of the miRNAs and genes targets an inverse relationship. Speci cally, for monocytes for the speci cg e n et a r g e t st h em i R N A s had an inverse correlation (Fig. 7b). Since the miRNAs will traditionally silence the speci c gene target, this result is what we would expect and provides further validation in astronauts that these miRNAs in circu-lation will be ideal targets to reduce health risks as our in vitroresults show. We noticed that most of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes in the JAXA data were downregulated during the ight, indicating that increased activity of the let-7a-5p, mir-125b-5p, and mir-16-5p mightcause the suppression of these target genes in astronauts (Fig. 6e). Most of the genes show up-regulation post- ight as compared to pre- ight and during ight (Fig. 6e). This is consistent with the i4 data, in which antagomir-rescued gene activity is signi cantly increased post- ight compared to the pre- ight in most of the cell types sampled from the astronauts (Fig. 6c). The ratio of up-regulation in these selected 21 antagomir-rescued genes is more signi cant than the average up-regulation ratio of all genes (Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that this subset is more susceptible to expression change due to the space environment. Cell-dependent differences are detectable for speci c genes during space ight for the I4 astronauts data (Fig. 6en and Supple- mentary Fig. 6). Two genes, ARL6IP6 (ADP Ribosylation Factor Like GTPase 6 Interacting Protein 6) and TSEN15 (TRNA Splicing Endonu- clease Subunit 15), are signi cantly up-regulated post- ight compared to pre- ight in eight of the ten cell types, with CD16 cells and den- dritic cells (DCs) not signi cantly different for ARL6IP6 and CD14 cells, and DCs not signi cantly different for TSEN15 .ARL6IP6 is involved in ischemic strokes in patients 41, which could have implica- tions related to microvessel damage in space. In murine stem cells,ARL6IP6 exhibits properties of regulating nuclear envelope structure, interacting with proteins involved in nuclear envelope resealing and repair 42.TSEN15 is involved in tRNA splicing and intron removal fun- damental processes for cell growth and division43.I th a sb e e ni m p l i - cated in hypoplasia (the impairment in development of tissues andorgans due to the decrease in cell number) 44.S p e c i cally, TSEN15 has been shown to cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and progressiveFig. 6  Expression of 21 genes rescued by the antagomir treatment in astro- nauts from the NASA Twin Study, JAXA CFE, and Inspiration4 (i4) missions. adHeatmaps displaying the 21 key gene pro le for the different cell types ( i.e.C D 4 T cells, CD8 T cells, CD19 B cells, and lymphocyte deleted cell population) fromRNA-seq on the NASA Twin Study. eHeatmap of the normalized plasma cell-free RNA expression values for the 21 key genes over time for the six astronauts over 120 days in space from JAXA study.

Although this occurs at an early stage of life ( i.e.i n f a n t s ) , one could speculate that TSEN15 may play important roles in cellproliferation in adults. Interestingly, TSEN15 has also been associated with autoin ammatory neurodegenerative diseases 45.ARL6IP6 ( ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 6) is predicted to be targeted by miR-125b-5p and let-7a-5p and TSEN15 is predicted to be targeted by miR-16-5p and let-7a-5 (Fig. 5). Skin biopsies from the i4 astronauts were also used for RNA-seq comparing post- ight to pre- ight (Fig. 6s) with four different skin regions in the analysis: Outer Epidermis (OE), Inner Epidermis (IE),Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA). The VA compartment isclosely related to the 3D microvessel cell models which seems toproduce the strongest regulation of the 21 key genes. ARL6IP6 is upregulated in the VA for post- ight compared to pre- ight similar to what is observed in the blood (Fig. 6ir), while TSEN15 is down- regulated. Interestingly, 57, 52, and 52 of the 21 genes weredownregulated for the OE, IE, and VA regions, while for the OD region only 38 were downregulated. Overall, for all the astronaut data, the measured changes of these genes from ex vivo cellular samples maysuggest that an interventional treatment with the three antagomirsmight lead to improved astronaut health.Major cellular pathways altered by radiation exposure and res- cued by antagomir treatment To determine the key pathways that are altered by radiation with or without antagomir treatment, we performed pathway analysis on thebulk RNA-seq data via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Using the Hallmark database 46, general pathway enrichments were more pro- nounced in the mature microvessels compared to the angiogenesismodel (Fig. 8a, b). Radiation exposure in both these models triggered positive enrichment of pathways typically observed from this treat-ment such as TP53, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-alpha signaling. Forboth the mature microvessel and angiogenesis cellular models, therewas a signi cantly decreased enrichment associated with the mitotic spindle due to radiation exposure that was reversed by the antagomirtreatment. This is consistent with the fact that cellular death followingradiation exposure may occur through mitotic catastrophe due tofailure of mitotic spindle checkpoints 47. An increase in in ammatory-related genes and pathways after irradiation is a common occurrence driving the late effects of radiation injury48,49. Radiation exposure with antagomir treatment caused a signicant reversal in enrichment for several of these pathways. Strikingly, in both mature and angiogenesis microvessels, pathways for Fig. 8  Pathway analysis on the mature and angiogenesis 3D microvessel cell culture models revealing key functions being mitigated by the antagomirsafter exposure to GCR irradiation.

The nominal enrichment score (NES) represents the relative degree a gene set is changed and is corrected for gene set size.Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 10an in ammatory response, TNF-alpha signaling, interferon responses, and IL-6 are signi cantly decreased by the addition of antagomirs (Fig. 8a, b). Pathways for hypoxia, DNA repair, and oxidative phos- phorylation are also activated with the GCR treatment while the antagomir treatment inhibits these pathways. The antagomirs also restored the suppression associated with cell cycle observed withspace radiation for the angiogenesis model (Fig. 7b). As a result, the antagomirs appear to be regulating key pathways in the radiationresponse that may be essential in assisting repair of the damage causedby space radiation in the mature microvasculature. To further explore the consequences of antagomir treatment to radiation exposure, Reactome genesets consisting of 26 super path-ways were examined (Fig. 8c, d). Positively or negatively enriched genesets in the same direction by irradiation with or without antag-omirs were excluded. The remaining genesets have opposing enrich- ments or are enriched by only one treatment. These pathways may represent critical targets that provide bene cial effects from antag- omir treatment. Genes involved in DNA repair by Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) are enriched in mature microvessels after radiation exposure (Fig. 8c). However, adding antagomirs suppresses these changes as well aschanges in genes linked to DNA damage bypass via translation synth-esis. This was accompanied by a decrease in pathways involved incellular stress e.g. genesets for heme oxygenase 1, hypoxia, detox-ication of ROS, EIF2AK4 (GCN2) amino acid de ciencies as well as a decrease in cell cycle control including telomere maintenance. Nota- bly, there was an overall increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) orga- nization with the irradiation and antagomirs that was not statisticallysignicant with radiation alone. Earlier during the angiogenesis phase of the microvessels, irradiation overwhelmingly decreased cell cyclegenesets while the addition of the antagomirs abolished this statisti-cally signi cant manifestation (Fig. 8d). DNA replication as well as DNA DSB repair by homologous recombi nation was also returned to non- signicant control levels by antagomir treatment. DNA damage, in ammation, stress and mitochondrial dysfunc- tion are normally associated with the induction of cellularsenescence 48. Therefore, we used publicly available databases com- piling markers of cellular senescence50,51to investigate whether GCR caused senescence and the antagomirs protected the 3D humanmicrovasculature model from it. Curiously, most senescence pathwayswere suppressed by GCR, except for oncogene-induced senescence(Supplementary Fig. 8). This is consistent with upregulation of TP53 target genes, although it dissociates oncogene induction from othercauses of senescence induction. The antagomirs did not revert thesephenotypes, except in the angiogenesis model, where they promotedcellular senescence in GCR-exposed cells. Antagomir treatment after space radiation modulates critical cellular pathways To speci cally observe how key immune and in ammatory pathways are regulated with and without the antagomir treatment in the spaceenvironment, we analyzed a custom curation of genesets for innateand adaptive immune pathways (Fig. 9). There was an overall increased activity with GCR radiation exposure for the mature microvessel cul-ture. However, when the antagomirs were applied, general in amma- tory and immune pathways were restored back to the 0 Gy level for themature microvessel model with a negative regulation in the angio-genesis cell model indicating that this countermeasure treatmentdiminished this response of GCR irradiation in the maturemodel (Fig. 9a). In mature 3D microvessel models, GCR radiation treatment sig- nicantly upregulated several interferon-driven sensitive genes (ISGs), including DDX58, IFIH1 ,IFIT2 , and to a lesser extent, IFIH1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFITM1, IFITM3, OAS1-2 amongst others (Fig. 9b). Also upregulated by GCR radiation treatment were the cytokinechemokinegenes CXCL10 andCXCL11 , which function as pro-in ammatory mole- cules associated with activation, differentiation, and chemotaxis ofimmune cells. In contrast, treatment with the antagomirs produceddecreased levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 and of all these ISG genes except for IFIH1 and OAS2 . The NLRP3 inammasome is a multiprotein complex formed by NLRP3, PYCARD and CASP1 that plays a pivotal role in regulating the innate immune system and in ammatory signaling. Upon activation by cytosolic danger signals, the NLRP3 inammasome activates CASP1 triggering the maturation of IL-1,NF-Bactivation, and the initiation of cell death via GSDMB 52. GCR-treated cell cultures signi cantly upregulated NLRP3 and, to a lesser extent PYCARD ,CASP1 ,a n d NFKB1 , while treatment with antagomirs lessened the induction of these genes(Fig. 9b). Together, the increases in ISGs, cytokineschemokines and NLRP3 inammasome indicate that GCR radiation exposure promotes a robust innate immune response associated with increased produc- tion of pro-in ammatory molecules and immune cell activation. In contrast, the antagomir treatment downregulates and restores thesefactors back to normal levels. The adaptive immune genes were notsignicantly altered, consistent with the transient cell stress induced by the GCR treatment and potentially due to the fact that the 3D cellmodel does not contain any T cells (Fig. 9c). Mitochondrial damage mitigation after antagomir treatment with space radiation Mitochondrial stress has been previously implicated as a critical and consistently dysregulated phenotype during space ight12.M i t o c h o n - dria play a crucial role in metabolism by integrating signals from stressand the environment, such as nutrient deprivation and oxidativestress, to coordinate cellular metabolism 53. Thus, the MitoPathways collection54was used to examine mitochondria-related activity in our 3D cell culture model. GCR exposure combined with antagomirtreatment in the mature microvessels signi cantly decreased expres- sion of 106 of 149 available genesets (Fig. 10a). Radiation exposure alone did not signi cantly alter 72 of these genesets as highlighted in Fig.10b. The largest of six major networks involves metabolism-linked MitoPathways where antagomirs with GCR exposure over- whelmingly downregulated 44 of 50 genesets (Fig. 10b). Negative enrichment in 8 of 9 subpathways are associated with carbohydrate,lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, metal, vitamin, and sulfur metabolismas well as detoxi cation. The substantial metabolic alterations may depend on the changes affecting the mitochondria which were alsolargely downregulated indicating an overall decrease in cellularenergetics. The OXPHOS and Mitochondrial Central Dogma Mito-Pathways include crucial factors for oxidative phosphorylationfunctions (Complexes I-V subunits and assembly factors) and pro-teins encoded within mitochondrial DNA and factors involved in their expression, respectively. These genesets were nearly all decreased when antagomirs were added to the radiation exposure.The increased enrichment of 7 subpathways by radiation treatmentalone (OXPHOS and OXPHOS subunits, CI and CV subunits, ComplexI, Mitochondrial Ribosome, and Translation) was completelyreversed with the antagomirs. In response to stress stimuli, eukaryotic cells activate the inte- grated stress response (ISR) to restore cellular homeostasis via com-munication between organelles 55. The communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is essential for cellular homeostasis42, due to the large number of mitochondrial proteins encoded by thenucleus. Considering the observed decrease in mitochondrial and changes in stress pathways, the ISR genes were examined in more detail. GCR exposure in the mature 3D cell cultures downregulated ISRgenes involved in amino acid uptakebiosynthesis, death factors,endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER-UPR) activa-tion, and lipid metabolism, while only ISR survival genes wereArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 11positivity enriched (Fig. 10c). Fewer genesets were affected by GCR exposure, which increased the ATF4 targets geneset and decreased ER-homeostasis. Initiation of the ISR is driven by the activation of thekinases HRI (EIF2AK1), PKR (EIF2AK2), PERK (EIF2AK3), or GCN2(EIK2AK4) which occurs in the mature cell model with GCR radiation(Fig. 10d). These kinases phosphorylate eIF2 , impairing cytosolic protein synthesis and activating expression of the ISR transcriptionfactors ATF4, ATF5 ,a n d CHOP . Increased levels of ATF4, ATF5 ,a n d CHOP in the angiogenesis cell model (Fig. 10c, d) induce the expression of the downstream ISR-target genes involved in redox maintenance,lipid metabolism, amino acid uptakebiosynthesis, ER-homeostasis, death, survival, and the ER and mitochondrial UPR. For irradiation combined with the antagomirs, genesets are returned to baseline.These results suggest that cells activate ISR as an adaptive cellularresponse after exposure to space radiation, whereas this activation isprevented by the antagomirs (Fig. 10d).Discussion Our previous study1315demonstrated a signi cant association between circulating miRNAs and space ight-associated health risks. These 13 circulating miRNAs were connected to the immune system, cellulardifferentiation, motility, proliferation, and survival 13,15. Three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, were linked to an increased riskof cardiovascular disease during space ight 13,15,56. A collapse of microvessels in 3D cell cultures after exposure to space radiation13,21 was associated with breakdown of the endothelial barrier and the loss of tight junctions57. GCR-induced inhibition of microvessels during angiogenesis was dependent on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the charged particles58,59. Although the microvessel cells are post-mitotic, differential effects on DNA repair occur according to radiation quality(e.g. LET) 20. The mixed simpli ed simulation of GCR uses ve ions of different energies (Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Silicon, and Iron)48 which are highly effective at inhibiting angiogenesis14.

The majority of cellular processes involving let-7a are well studied in development, proliferation, differentiation, and cancer, buti t sr o l ei ni n ammation, cardiovascular diseases, andor stroke are not well understood 61.Let-7a is involved in hematopoietic stem and pro- genitor cell homeostasis such as self-renewal, proliferation, quies-cence, and differentiation by blocking the TGF pathway and amplifying Wnt signaling 62. MicroRNA 16 (miR-16) is linked to human malignancies63and can modulate the cell cycle, inhibit cell proliferation, promote cellular apoptosis, and suppress tumorigenicity64.T h et a r g e t so fm i R - 1 6m a y be directly responsible for these effects such as the anti-apoptoticgene BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) 65, numerous genes involved in the G1-S transition, such as cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1 and CDK6 (cyclin- dependent kinase 6), and genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway,such as WNT3A (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A) 66. In endothelial cells, angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ),VEGF receptor-2 ( VEGFR2 ), and broblast growth factor receptor-1 ( FGFR1 ), were identi ed by bioin- formatic approaches and subsequently validated as targets bymiR-16 67. The miR-125 family plays an important role in the growth and development of animals, as well as stress response, p53 activation68 and the occurrence and development of cancer69. In addition, the role of miR-125 in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cannot beignored. The miR-125 family is associated with the development anddifferentiation of mammalian embryonic hearts 70. Furthermore, it plays an important role in diseases and pathophysiological processessuch as, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, stroke, myocardial brosis, endothelial cell injury and myocardial cell apoptosis 70. A recent paper has described the presence of miR-125b in osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs)71and in bone matrix where it hampers osteoclastogenesis and boneresorption by targeting PRDM1 (PR domain zinc nger protein 1), thus suggesting that miR-125b might have an active role in the developmentof vascular calci cations 72. All three miRNAs were initially found to be associated with cancer and neoplasia. However, unregulated cell cycle control is unlikely to be the only pathway that mitigates the biological effects of GCR. Ourresults from the mature microvessel model support this notion, sincemature microvessels are postmitotic and the timing of events is toorapid to be downstream of cell cycle control, although this does notrule out an indirect involvement of cell cycle proteins. At 24 h afterGCR irradiation and 48 h after antagomir treatment, protection ofmicrovessel morphology is observed compared to the GCR-stressedcontrol not treated with antagomirs. Individual inhibition of each target miRNA and the resulting mitigation of GCR effects suggests that each miRNA is similarlyeffective and therefore the targets of each must contain genes that are active in this process. Twelve of 21 key genes targeted by at least two of the three miRNAs (Fig. 5a) are potential candidates for protecting the microvessel physiology. These include genes involved in apoptosisand p53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions,innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with Fig. 10  Mitigation of mitochondrial dysregulation and integrated stress response (ISR) with antagomir treatment on mature and angiogenesis 3D cell culture models irradiated with GCR. a Lollipop plots for the GSEA analysis on mitochondrial pathways determined from MitoCartaMitoPathway for 3D maturemicrovessel cell culture (FDR  0.25).

However, apoptosis is not measurable in these cultures as much higherdoses of heavy and light ions are needed to detect this mechanism 21by TUNEL assay although this does not rule out earlier apoptosis signal- ing. Direct action of genes involved in the cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions is unlikely in mature microvessels. Involvement of cellularprograms from the innate immune response is a possibility, sinceimmune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by spaceradiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on sup-pressing DNA repair indicates a much earlier time of action, likelyupstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of maturevessels. This suggests that early response genes involved in radiationexposure might be targets for the antagomirs; these would includegenes of general in ammatory and immune pathways. There are 5 genes that are affected in common with all 3 antagomirs. When inhibited, all products of these genes are candidates for mediating the resistance to radiation damage, although the effects of other genesaffected by each individual antagomir cannot be ruled out. Each genehas functions that could contribute to GCR resistance. APAF1 and NIBAN1 are involved in the control of apoptosis and may prevent progression towards senescence 73.XPO6 andSLC7A1 are involved in transport across membranes between cell compartments, a processinvolved in early responses to cell stressors 74,75.PDPR regulates pyr- uvate phosphorylation and may facilitate protective functions thatrequire a higher energy output 76. Overall it appears that several path- ways are involved in protection and are acting in concert to push the cells into a more healthy and active biological state. C h a n g e si ni m m u n er e s p o n s ea p p e a rt ob eah a l l m a r ko fs p a c e radiation and targeted by miRNAs. We previously have shown thatcytotoxic and helper T cells are suppressed and key innate immuneresponse-related factors are dysregulated in C57BL6 female miceexposed to 0.5 Gy GCR irradiation 14. Markers of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell populations in the I4 astronauts (Fig. 6j, k) also indicate dysregulation occurring during space ight. The similarities between both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate a paral-lelism that gives con dence about using the 3D cell culture model to conrm the effectiveness of the antagomir treatment strategy to pre- vent and countermeasure space radiation damage. Space ight can affect mitochondrial stability 12. The ability of antagomirs to rescue mitochondria-associated pathways affected byradiation indicates the potential for using these antagomirs to rescueharmful phenotypes in space travelers. In particular, the OXPHOSpathway, which was downregulated upon treatment with GCR-stress,showed a rescue-like effect (Fig. 10). Impaired OXPHOS can lead to cell death due to insuf cient ATP for energy use, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or overproduction of prooxidant agents 77.E l e c - tron carriers, like the amidoxime-reducing complex, assists in thisprocess and show downregulation in the presence of radiation. This radiation phenotype has the potential to progress to in ammation. Speci cally, the genes whose upregulation was returned to normal by the addition of antagomir include those of complex I, complex V, andother OXPHOS subunits. Genotoxic stress caused by ionizing or UV radiations is a potent inducer of cellular senescence. Curiously, GCR suppresses most of thepathways associated with cellular senescence curated based on datafrom broblasts, renal epithelial cells and adipocytes induced to senescence by different stimuli, including X-ray irradiation, oncogeneoverexpression, antiretroviral drug or hyperinsulinemia 50,51.T h i ss u g - gests that either GCR does suppress classical cellular senescence orGCR-induced senescence in our 3D cell culture differs from the pre- viously studied mechanisms of senescence induction by radiation (Supplementary Fig. 8). The latter is supported by previous evidencedemonstrating that different senescence stimuli drive very distinctphenotypes 51. The only senescence-related pathway induced by GCR in our model is oncogene-induced senescence, which is consistent withactivation of p53 target genes. The antagomirs have no effect on the mature culture model, but in the irradiated angiogenesis model theypromote various senescence-related pathways. Future studies arerequired to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models,in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population(broblastpericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effectin vivo (human). The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied. We observe a signi cant change in orphan gene expression from GCR irradiation stress and from antagomir treatment(Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4). Many orphan genes were upregu- lated in the 3D mature microvessel cell culture and interestingly, downregulated in the angiogenesis model. Some of these orphan genes may be integrated into the metabolic and regulatory processesthat are targeted by the miRNAs. Orphan genes themselves are simpleproteins that often act by binding to conserved proteins such astranscription factors or receptors 31,78. Some orphan genes are key for reproduction, some are toxins, and many confer resistance tostress 30,31,7982, however, orphan genes do not appear to encode enzymes, likely because of the very long time scale required for evo-lution of a specialized catalytic site 82. Many orphan genes are expres- sed to high levels only in discrete tissues or under speci ca b i o t i c stresses or diseases30,32,79,82,83. The alteration of orphan gene expression with GCR irradiation and antagomir treatment warrants further examination. Due to the nature of performing experiments in the space envir- onment, it can be limiting and dif cult to simulate perfectly the con- ditions in space in ground experiments. So to perfectly recreate thespace radiation dose and dose-rate that astronauts will receive duringlong-duration space ights (lasting several months) is not possible. The ground-based experimental setup reported in this manuscript used forirradiating with GCRs currently represents the best approximation forvalidation of predictive models and while enabling countermeasuredevelopments. Thus, extrapolation and comparison from the astro- naut data to cell culture studies conducted on Earth as well as mice experiments both on Earth and during space ight are key to mean- ingful interpretation of biological results applicable to space ight. Lastly, it is possible that the differences in the radiation delivery mightaccount for any deviations between the results we are observing. The present microvascularized model is a simpli ed system hosting endothelial cells only and one shall point out the absence ofthe very important pericytes. Indeed, it is well known that whenendothelial cells organize into microvascular networks (duringangiogenesis), stromal cells associate with newly formed microvesselsto stabilize the structure. Fibroblasts can play this role by adopting a pericytic-type phenotype 8486. To push forward the full understanding of the GCR effect on angiogenesis , it might be necessary, in a close future, to complexify the model, at least toward a multicellularcompartment 87. In addition, it will be essential for future studies to test the toxicity of the antagomirs in in vivo models, since the tissue modelutilized for this manuscript is limited for this purpose. The inhibition of three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let- 7a-5p, facilitates the reduction of cellular damage from ionizingradiation exposure. Treatment with antagomirs that inhibited thesethree miRNAs before and after radiation exposure in mature andangiogenesis 3D human HUVEC cell culture models, completely pre-vented the microvessel collapse and inhibition of microvessel devel- opment caused by GCR exposure. The potential effectiveness of these antagomirs to reduce prolonged tissue damage through modi ed DNA repair activity and alterations in cellular mitochondria offers a uniquetarget for the development of radiation countermeasures for space-ight as well as for terrestrial applications.Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 14Methods Ethical statement All mice experiments were approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory s (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) and were performed by trained per- sonnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conform-ing to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Useof Laboratory Animals.

Cell culture Prior to culturing 3D microvessels, HUVEC (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA), primary cells isolated from the vein of the umbilical cord werecultured as 2D monolayers in complete endothelial basal medium (EBM; Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ, USA), containing EGM medium (serum free) supplemented with 2 fetal bovine serum (FBS), human epi-dermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and bovine brain extract. Cellswere kept in a humidi ed incubator (5 CO2, 95 air) and the medium was changed twice a week. All cells used for experiments were cellsthawed from a fresh vial. 3D HUVEC vessel cell model In this study, 3D cell culture was performed according to the methodinitially described by Davis et al. 88with modi cations described in Grabham et al.21. Brie y, a collagen gel solution (Rat tail Collagen Type 1, BD Biosciences, Bedford MA) was prepared on ice by mixing toge- ther the following stock solutions: 0.35 collagen solution, 10  M199medium, and 1 M HEPES (pH 7.4) in a ratio of 8:1:1 by (volume). Thissolution was then mixed with matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA)in a ratio of 3:1 by (volume). HUVECs grown in EGM on 2D cell culturedishes (80 90 con uence) were detached with a trypsin solution (0.025) and resuspended in EGM-2 (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA).The cell solution was mixed with the gel solution in a ratio 1:5 (byvolume). The resulting cell suspension contained a nal cell suspen- sion of 110 6cellsml. 25 l was dropped onto the cell growing surface inside a tissue culture ask (T25) (Corning) and allowed to gel at 37 C for 30 min. The gel matrices were then overlaid with EGM-2 medium for 7 days with daily media changes. EBM-2 consists of EGM-2 media supplemented with 2 FBS, human broblast growth factor B (hFGF- B), human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), human vascular endothe-lial cell growth factor (hVEGF), long R insulin-like growth factor 1(R3-IGF-1), ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone and heparin. 50 nM Phorbol 12- Myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Millipore Sigma) was also added to thegrowth media. Cells embedded in 200 300-m thick gel matrices were incubated at 37 C in a humidi ed incubator (5 CO2, 95 air) for the times indicated. The medium was refreshed every 24 h or as otherwise stated in individual experiments. For mature microvessels,cells were cultured for 6 days and treated with AUMantagomir TM(AUM biotech) (0.5 M each) 24 h before radiation exposure then xed 24 h later. For the angiogenesis model, cultures were irradiated on day onea n dc u l t u r e df o r6m o r ed a y sb e f o r e xation. Preliminary experiments showed that antagomir treatment on days 2 and 3 were most effective.For DNA damagerepair (i.e. 53BP1 staining), cultures were xed at 90 min after irradiations. Simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) exposure Irradiation of microvessel models and animals were conducted at theNASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven NationalLaboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Samples were positioned in the plateauregion of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature. Dosi-metry was performed by the NSRL physics staff. For microvesselmodels, cultures were seeded at Columbia University in New York Citythen transported to BNL the same day. Irradiations were carried outthe following day (Day 1) at NSRL. A 20 cm  20 cm beam was utilized.Since the heavy-ion beam at NSRL is horizontal, asks containing 5 ml of medium were upended to a vertical position for a few minutesduring irradiation. All cultures were irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simpli ed simulated GCR (referred to as GCR). The irradiation was used with ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula for 5 ions:protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeVn,4He at 250 MeVn,16Oa t 350 MeVn,56Fe at 600 MeVn, and protons at 250 MeV, in the fol- lowing proportions 1000 MeV protons at 34.8, 250 MeV protons at 39.3,28Si at 1.1,4He at 18,16Oa t5 . 8  ,a n d56Fe at 1. This mixture is the simpli ed version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratoryclass missions 48. The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of charged particles although high LET ions generally havea greater relative biological effect (RBE). Quanti cation of 3D human cell culture models after irradiation: Immunocytochemistry, Imaging, and microvessel analysis All microvessel cultures were xed and stained as for monolayers. Fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde followed by three washes in Phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) with 0.5 Triton-X, and nally in PBS. 5-(4,6- Dichlorotriazinyl) Amino uorescein (DTAF) (Thermo sher Scienti c) w a su s e dt oa sa uorescent green stain for all proteins to visualize microvessels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 53BP1 foci were immu-nostained using a polyclonal antibody against 53BP1 (Catalog :NB100-304, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and a counterstain for nuclei with YOYO green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by Alexa uor conjugates 495 or 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images were captured on a Nikon TE 200 confocal C1 microscope withEZ-C1 software. Analysis of images was carried out using NIH Image J v.1.44k software 68. Initial analysis on microvessels was carried out on randomly selected 20X elds from within the gel matrix. Thresholded images of microvessels were outlined as perimeters then divided by 2for length measurements. For the improved analysis the eld size was increased 4-fold by using images captured by a 10 objective. Themature microvessels were de ned more rigorously as those of a minimum diameter of 12.5 m. This step eliminated many immature thin vessels and reduced the effective doses. Finally, the sample elds were standardized, by imaging microvessels at a constant depth (50 mm above the substrate). All analyses were carried out blind. DNAdouble strand break repair foci assay was carried out by counting thenumber of foci per nucleus.Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 15MicroRNA predictions of DNA DSB gene targets and network generation We predicted speci c DNA DSB genes that are targeted by three miRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p. The DNA DSB gene list was determined by ltering out all DNA DSB related Gene Ontology (GO) pathways46,89. Each GO DNA DSB pathway will have curated genes associated with the pathway. We compiled all genes related to theseinto a master list and deleted any duplicated genes. We then utilizedthe ClueGOCluePedia plugin 90,91in Cytoscape92to map the relation- ship between the gene targets for the three miRNAs. This was done byincluding all DNA DSB genes and the three miRNAs in the initial querylist. The edges and connections were made with CluePedia utilizing thefollowing miRNA-mRNA databases in the plugin: CluePedia STRING-Actions (v.11.0_9606_27.02.2019), CluePedia microRNA.org-humanpredictions_s_O_aug2020, miRDB_v6.0, miRanda-miRNAs v5-2012-07- 19, mirTarBase, and mirecords.umn.edu.validated.miRNAs-2010-11-25. Nucleic acid extraction for 3D human cell culture models We used n 5 biological replicates for each condition for RNA-seq. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia,CA). Gel matrix cryotubes containing the cells of interest were takenout of 80 C and 1 mL of QIAzol reagent was added to the tubes. Each sample contained 300 800 L of gel matrix and approximately 500,000 cells. While the gel matrix thawed in QIAzol, the solution waspipetted and vortexed until fully dissolved. The lysate was passedthrough a QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to further homogenize the cells. 100 L of gDNA eliminator solution was added. The resulting lysate from each sample was then used to isolate andpurify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in3050L RNAse free H2O. Concentration of all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNADNAmiRNAcDNA Quanti cation using Qubit Fluorimeter 93. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNAScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Spike in Protocols before library preparation in 3D cultures ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of libraryprep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRRUHRR Controls forTotal RNA Sequencing 93. Library construction for RNA-sequencing on 3D cultures RNA ribo-depletion and library preparation was done with IlluminaTruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego,CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN  6.5 (average RINof 8.7). Index adapters used were at 1.5 M (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 PCR cycles were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNAScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLabSOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeSta-tion System with D1000 reagent kit 93. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNADNAmiRNAcDNA Quanti cation using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed oniSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Bulk RNA-sequencing and data processing on 3D cultures RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp(8 bp index 9 bp UMI), Index2: 8 bp Read 2:151 bp. PhiX was included as an internal control and to increase librarydiversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 andiSeq 100 Sequencers 93.Raw fastq les were assessed for percent rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and ltered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq le quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (ver- sion 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM(version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome versionGRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) con-catenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher ( https:assets. thermo sher.comTFS-AssetsLSGmanualsERCC92.zip ), and the fol- lowing gtf annotation le: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.101.gtf con- catenated with the ERCC92.gtf le from ThermoFisher ( https:assets. thermo sher.comTFS-AssetsLSGmanualsERCC92.zip ). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens  ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and aligned reads were assessed for stranded- ness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quanti ed using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. pyrpipe was used for quanti cation of the orphan genes and other EB genes 23,69. Using DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed separately for the 3 conditions on each3D microvessel cell culture model. Quanti cation data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized withDESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data was nor-malized twice, each time using a different size factor. The rst used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used onlyERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normal- ized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Dif- ferential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) usingDESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the log 2(Fold- Change) values and the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was usedto generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb(v2.8.4), PANTHER.db (v1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (v3.15.0). We haveutilized for our analysis a p-value  0.05 for statistical signi cance and acknowledge the potential of more false positives to occur. All TPMvalues can be found in Supplemental Data 1. Raw RNA-seq data is available on the NASA OSDR s Biological Data Management Environment 94with accession number: OSD-577. Determination of the 21 key gene targets for the three miRNAs, cumulative plots for the miRNA targets, and statistical test To determine the 21 key gene targets for miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, we found the genes that were statistically signi cantly d o w n r e g u l a t e df o r0 . 5G yv s0G ya n dn ol o n g e rs i g n i cant for 0.5 Gy with antagomir vs 0 Gy. We then utilized mirDIP95to determine the gene targets for all 3 miRNAs with a criteria of medium score class. Themedium score class has been shown in the literature to provide areasonable criteria for determining gene targets for miRNAs 35.W e overlapped these two lists of genes and found 21 genes. The 21 gene fold-change values, statistics, and TPM values can be found in Sup-plemental Data 2. We used the Target Mining function of the online platform miRwalk 96. It allowed searching the 21 gene targets against the three miRNAs (hsa-miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16), and investigatetheir 3 -, 5 -UTR and coding sequence (CDS) regions with a binding probability cutoff of at least 0.75 (Sankey plot part of Fig. 5bd). To this, we have added the genes respective log2 fold change given a GCR (0.5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). To build the cumulative plots for the 21 miRNA gene targets, we obtained the information about whether these genes have 7mer or 8mer sites that match the seed region of each the three miRNAs (hsa- miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16) using the TargetScan v8.0database 97. mRNAs were then grouped according to miRNA seed sequences (7mer-1A, 7mer-m8 or 8mer or no site ), and the cumulative plot was generated using the mRNA log2 fold change values using theArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 16ecdfplot method from seaborn98. To compare distributions of mRNA fold change values for each seed match with the no site case, we calculated the Kolmogorov Smirnov test using the kstest function from scipy in python99. To determine the experimental validation for the 21 gene targets to the miRNAs, we utilized three databases which are: miRTarBasev9.0 37,T a r B a s ev 9 . 038,a n dS t a r B a s ev 2 . 039. Both TarBase and miRTar- Base include literature references for the experimental validation. Wealso provided additional literature references for some genes as indi-c a t e di nS u p p l e m e n t a r yT a b l e1 .W ed i s p l a y e dt h e s er e s u l t sb o t hi nSupplementary Table 1 and as bar plots (Fig. 5j) using ggplot2 (ver 3.3.5). Conserved miRNA analysis between humans and mice Selected precursor and mature miRNA sequences from human and mouse were extracted from miRBase v.22.1100. After BLASTN align- ment, conservation between mouse and human sequences wasdetermined as the percentage of aligned nucleotide identities inmature and pre-miRNA sequences. RTPCR on key gene targets Total RNA samples were prepared from the same RNA isolated for thebulk RNA-seq as described above and were DNase I treated usingTRIzol according to the manufacturer s instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the BioRad iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix. To quantify gene expression of genes using TaqMan probes BioRad iTaq Universal Probes Supermix was used to perform quan- titative real-time PCR. To quantify gene expression of genes using DNAprobes BioRad iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix was used to perform quantitative real-time PCR. ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S were usedas an internal reference. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions wereperformed on an BioRad CFX384 Real-Time PCR Instrument. Delta-delta-cycle threshold ( CT) was determined relative to ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S levels and normalized to control samples. Error barsindicate the standard deviation of the mean from at least three bio-logical replicates. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) For pathway analysis, we utilized fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(fGSEA) 101. Pathway analysis was done utilizing both MSigDB gene sets46(speci cally, Hallmark and KEGG) and custom-made Gene Set les from MitoPathway and expert-curated mitochondrial genes available in89. Using fGSEA, all samples were compared to controls and the ranked list of genes was de ned by the t-score statistics. The sta- tistical signi cance was determined by 1000 permutations of the genesets89. We utilized a statistical cutoff of FDR  0.05 as recom- mended by GSEA and lollipop plots were made using ggplot2 (ver3.3.5). All GSEA data generated for this manuscript can be found in Supplemental Data 3. Murine simulated space environment experiments The murine data utilized here were from experiments previously reported by Malkani et al.13and Paul et al.14.A l le x p e r i m e n t sw e r e approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory s (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) andall experiments were performed by trained personnel in AAALACaccredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S.National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of LaboratoryAnimals. All methods were carried out in accordance with the relevantguidelines and regulations and are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Brie y,n8 0 1 5 - w e e k   3-day old, C57Bl6J wildtype female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories andhoused at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Uponarrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard12:12 h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperaturehumidity for1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libi- tum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. The normally loaded (NL) mice were originally utilized in parallel experiments withhindlimb unloaded mice which were not reported in this manuscript. Mice were cage acclimated ( n1 0m i c ep e rg r o u p ;2m i c ep e rc a g et o maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-dayseither normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded. Irradiation wasadministered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-h post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO 2overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at2000  gfor 15 min. Plasma was collected and ash frozen in liquid nitrogen for 80 C storage. A 100 l aliquot of cellular fraction was ash frozen and stored at 80 C for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with 1 RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scienti c) followed by ow cytometric preparation and analyses, as described below. All organs were ash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at 80 C. Body weight tracking was performed on days 3, 0, 7 and 14. On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space R a d i a t i o nL a b o r a t o r y( N S R L )f a c i l i t yb ya n i m a lc a r es t a f fa n dw e r etransferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiationwere administered; GCR (0.5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). Mice werepositioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated atroom temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irra-diation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mis-sion, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 min instead ofthe actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. A 60  60 beam was uti-lized at the NSRL for irradiation. Sham controls were treated similarlyto GCR irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line(without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simulation,i.e. 25 min. miRNA extraction from murine tissues MiRNA extractions from plasma and all tissues were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy serumplasma kit (Cat 217184). MiRNA extrac- tions from dissolved microvessel constructs were carried out using theQiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (Cat 217004). Quantitation of miRNAsamples was done using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer(ThermoFisher Scienti c). miRNA sequencing on murine samples Library construction and sequencing was performed from miRNAs isolated from plasma, liver, heart, and soleus muscle from the mouseexperiments described above. The miRNA extraction was carried outusing the QIAgen miRNeasy kit (217004). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number 7. Approximately 1 go ft o t a lR N Aw a su s e dt o prepare a small RNA library according to the protocol of TruSeq SmallRNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Single-end sequen-cing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LCSciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor s recommended protocol. All miRNA-sequence raw data was deposited on NASAOSDR s Biological Data Management Environment with the following identi ers: for all heart tissue related data: OSD-334, DOI: 10.26030 cg2g-as49; for all liver tissue related data: OSD-335, DOI: 10.2603072ke-1k67: for all soleus muscle related data: OSD-337, DOI: 10.26030m73g-2477; and for all plasma related data: OSD-336, DOI: 10.26030 qasa-rr29. Analysis of miRNA sequencing from murine samples Raw reads were subjected to an in-house software program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, Texas, USA) to removeArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 17adapter dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequen-ces with length in 1826 nucleotide were mapped to speci c species precursors in miRBase 22.0 100by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5p- derived miRNAs. Length variation at both 3 and 5 ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to speci c species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identi ed as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of knownspeci c species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p- or 3p-derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mappedto other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of speci c species) in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the speci c species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two were de ned as known miRNAs. The unmapped sequences were BLASTed againstthe speci c genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing sequences were predicated from the ank 80 nt sequences using RNAfold software ( http:rna.tbi.univie.ac.atcgi-binRNAWebSuite RNAfold.cgi ). The criteria for secondary structure prediction were: (1) number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem ( 12); (2) number of base pairs in the stem region of the predicted hairpin ( 16); (3) cutoff of free energy (kCalmol 15); (4) length of hairpin (up and down stems  terminal loop 50); (5) length of hairpin loop ( 20); (6) number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region ( 8); (7) number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region ( 4); (8) number of biased bulges in mature region ( 2); (9) number of errors in mature region ( 7); (10) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin ( 12); and (11) percent of mature in stem ( 80). Differential expression of miRNAs based on normalized deep-sequencing counts was analyzed by selectively using Fisherexact test, Chi-squared 2  2 test, Chi-squared nXn test, Student st test, or ANOVA based on the experimental design. The signi cance threshold was set to be 0.01 and 0.05 in each test. T od e t e r m i n eg e n eo n t o l o g y( G O ) 102and C2 pathways being regulated by the miRNAs, we performed miRNA gene set analysis uti- lizing the RbiomirGS23v0.2.12 R package from the processed miRNA analysis for all conditions in the plasma and heart tissues. The Rbio-mirGS package has been extensively shown in the literature to providestrong pathway prediction that provide strong biological results 103 106. From the pathways we chose an FDR  0.25 cutoff for signi cantly regulated pathways. We plotted the speci c pathways with R package ggplot2. Weighted Gene Co-expression Ana lysis (WGCNA) of miRNAs-seq murine data Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the OSDR-334, OSDR-335, OSDR-336, and OSDR-337 miRNA-Seq data- sets. First, the miRNA-Seq datasets were merged and outlier samplesand genes were removed based on manual inspection using hier-archical clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the built-in WGCNA goodSamplesGenes() function. Then Variance StabilizingTransformation (VST) was performed using the R Bioconductorpackage, DESeq2 version 1.38.3. The R Bioconductor package, WGCNAversion 1.72-1 was used to perform WGCNA following the standardprotocol as detailed in the package vignette. NASA Twin Study data RNA-seq analysis Speci c details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study RNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Briey, we will highlight the key methods. The NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time oflaunch. The ight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control.Blood samples were collected into 4 mL CPT (Cell Preparation Tube with Sodium HeparinN) tubes (BD Biosciences Cat  362760) permanufacturer s recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation in at 1800  gfor 20 min at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at4 C u n t i l p r o c e s s i n g ( a v e r a g e o f 3 5 37 h after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and plannedfor long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozenat80 oC. Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed using the following steps: 1. plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and ash frozen prior to long term storage at 80oC. 2. The peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. 0.5 millionPBMCs were retrieved from one pre- ight and one post- ight samples, pelleted, ash frozen and stored at 80 oC until use for RNA extrac- tions. The ow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens werelysed into RLT buffer (Qiagen Cat 1053393), ash frozen and stored at80 oC until use. Details of transcriptome preparation, sequencing, and analysis were described previously17. NASA Twin Study data miRNA-seq analysis Speci c details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study miRNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Briey, we will highlight the key methods. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50 ng total RNA using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB E7560) per manufacturer s recommendations with the following modi cations: adapters and RT primer were diluted four fold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for libraryampli cation, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Dual Index Primers (NEBE7600, NEBE7780) were used to supplement the index primers inNEB E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeqinstrument (1x50bp). Standard libraries were preprocessed and quality controlled using miRTrace 107. Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences108using the miRDeep2109quanti er module. Expression values were normalized to reads per million (RPM) considering onlymiRNA counts. The normalized RPM value were utilized for all analysis.If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA wasexcluded from the analysis. To determine statistically signi cant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with p-value  0.2 was independently per- formed for each cell type. For ight only comparisons, the same sta- tistical signi cance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were runindependently for each cell conditiontype. To determine the overlapof the miRNA signature in this paper with the Twin Study miRNA-seq data, the proposed miRNAs were used as well as all mature compo- nents of the miRNAs included in the miRNA family. Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing aredescribed in Overbey et al. 19,a n dK i me ta l .110. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return;R1 ,R4 5 ,a n dR8 2 )t h es p a c e ight. There were two male and two female astronauts for this mission. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5  v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolatedPBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth humanPBMC reference. In summary, blood samples were c ollected before (prelaunch; L-92 days, 44 days, and 3 days) and after (return; R  1 day, R  45 days,and R  82 days) the space ight. 21 miRNA target genes suggested in the paper has been used for identifying DEGs from i4 PBMCs andsubpopulations. The Seurat method was used to normalize RNA countArticle https:doi.org10.1038s41467-024-48920-y Nature Communications  (2024) 15:4825 18data and calculate average expression of each gene. We used the average expression of the genes from four astronauts comparing post-ight (R  1) vs pre- ight (L-92, L-44, and L-3) to identify DEGs with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( p 0.05). Average expression of the 21 miRNA target genes was used to generate heatmap plotted by the pheatmap R package. Figure 6f was created with BioRender.com. For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before ight a n da ss o o na sp o s s i b l ea f t e rr e t u r n( L - 4 4a n dR  1 ) .T h e s eb i o p s i e swere ash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. A 20x scan was used to select 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) toguide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outerdermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. GeoMx WTA sequencing readsfrom NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ les corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion les using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, andread quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform differentialexpression analysis. The procedure followed guidelines set by HealthInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operatedunder Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols andinformed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted inaccordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB atthe Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB 21-05023569). JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quanti cation data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA s Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53018. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before,during, and after the space ight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for eachtime point. Heatmaps were made for the 21 genes key genes on thenormalized values per time point using R package pheatmap ver-sion 1.0.12.
